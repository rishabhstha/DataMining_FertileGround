STARKVILLE, Miss.— Mississippi State President Mark E. Keenum congratulates the United Nations World Food Programme for receiving the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, which was announced Friday [Oct. 9] by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

In addition to MSU’s partnerships with the United Nations and the World Food Programme, Keenum’s professional background and national leadership in promoting global food security have facilitated numerous engagements with the organization. In 2016, Keenum wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating the World Food Programme for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“I would like to personally congratulate the World Food Programme and its outstanding executive director, David Beasley, on this well-earned recognition,” Keenum said. “As the Norwegian Nobel Committee noted, addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world. That is why organizations like the World Food Programme are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

Members of MSU’s leadership team met with Beasley and other United Nations leaders last November in Rome, Italy, to discuss solutions to 21st century challenges such as food insecurity and hunger. In 2014, MSU signed an agreement with the World Food Programme that focuses on cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development.

Keenum serves as chairman of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development. A three-time MSU agricultural economics graduate, he has focused a significant portion of his career on global food security. In addition to his BIFAD appointment, he is chairman of the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. He has twice spoken at the United Nations in New York about the roles public research universities play in addressing critical food and agricultural challenges. Prior to returning to his alma mater, Keenum served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Serving as MSU’s president since 2009, Keenum has helped enhance the university’s standing as a leading agricultural research university. The most recent National Science Foundation survey shows MSU is ranked No. 11 nationally with $105 million in research and development expenditures in agricultural sciences. MSU is leading the USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, in addition to other national and international collaborations aimed at helping feed a global population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050.

1,"Dec 17, 2020",WJTV,Mississippi Food Network helps with food insecurity amid pandemic,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – The coronavirus pandemic has impacted thousands of people across Mississippi and has only added to the food insecurity issues.

Organizers at the Mississippi Food Network have ordered extra food in anticipation to feed even more people than they already have this year. The group distributes food year round. They have distributed almost 13 million more pounds of food compared to last year.

Kelly Mott, director of external affairs for the Mississippi Food Network, said in a normal year, the warehouse would be full of food bins from in-person donations. Although there haven’t been as many in-person donations this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual food drives have increased.

“This year, we have been blessed beyond measure to see an increase in donations. Mississippians always seen to show up and show out, and we are so appreciative to our donors that continue to give so that we can meet the need of our hungry neighbors,” stated Mott.

The organization received a major donation from Kroger on Thursday. The grocery store chain donated more than 1,700 food boxes, which contain non-perishable food items.

Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently made donations to Alcorn State University and Tougaloo College, donated $9 million to the Mississippi Food Network. This is the single largest donation the organization has ever had. Scott is the former wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

“MacKenzie Scott’s investment in Mississippi is a vote of confidence in the work we are all doing together to end hunger in our great state,” said Mississippi Food Network CEO Charles Beady. “From our more than 400 member agencies and our food donors, to all the individuals, businesses and foundations that support us with financial contributions at every level – we should all feel proud to receive this national and international recognition.”

2,"Feb 26, 2020",Jackson Free Press,Jackson's Food Insecurity Focus in April Expo,"In a state where one in four children go to bed hungry at night, solutions to the food insecurity that plagues Jackson and other southern cities are the goal of a series of public art installations and workshops. The Fertile Ground Expo, scheduled for April 9-11, aims to address the history and future of food access in Mississippi and beyond.

""We know when you are hungry, you can't perform at your best,"" Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at a press conference Tuesday in downtown Jackson. ""Hunger is a problem that reaches beyond one's belly but affects every aspect of a person's way of life, which ultimately impacts how we function as a society.""

Agriculture may be the state's leading industry, but Mississippi remains one of the hungriest in the country, Salam Rida pointed out at the presser. She is a program manager for the expo and an urban designer for the City of Jackson.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" In a recent report, the department revealed that more than 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2018.

Mississippi has consistently ranked as one of the most food-insecure states in the nation. Between 2010 and 2018, the state ranked No. 1 in food insecurity. It also has the highest poverty rate.

One in four Mississsippians—more than 600,000 people—experience food insecurity. The issue is especially profound for the state's elderly population and children. Half the state's senior population does not have enough to eat, and about 25% of Mississippi's children go to sleep hungry.

The Mississippi Food Network reports that in Hinds County alone, nearly 62,000 people have too little to eat—more than the entire food-insecure population of North Dakota.

Food insecurity has multiple adverse health impacts, ranging from developmental problems for young people to difficulties concentrating in school. Given that nutritious foods tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods, families struggling with food access are more likely to eat foods that are detrimental to their overall physical health. Experts also link food insecurity to additional problems such as housing access and inadequate access to medical care.

The USDA notes that a number of state-level factors affect the degree to which a state experiences food insecurity. These include wages, housing costs and unemployment as well as ""State-level policies that affect access to unemployment insurance, the State Earned Income Tax Credit, and nutrition assistance programs.""

""The goal of the expo weekend is not only to be critical of our existing food system, but to provide new ideas and solutions for developing a more food-secure environment for southern cities,"" Rida said.

Scheduled to take place in various Jackson neighborhoods experiencing food-access issues, the Fertile Ground Expo will bring together prominent area and national chefs, nutritionists, farmers, activists, artists, and policy makers for workshops, dialogues and exhibits related to food. More than 30 events will tackle topics including the history of food insecurity, how to ferment food, urban farming, food waste, the food traditions of Farish Street, the impact of food insecurity on families and more.

The event is free.

Participants include acclaimed artist Kara Walker, chef and food writer Mark Bittman, local chef Nick Wallace and interdisciplinary Mississippi artist Adrienne Domnick.

The mayor thanked Bloomberg Philanthropy for its $1-million gift to organize the expo. In 2018, Jackson became one of five cities that the philanthropic organization selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants as part of its Public Art Challenge competition. At the Feb. 25 press conference, Lumumba added that Bloomberg Philanthropy work was independent of Mike Bloomberg's campaign for the presidency, while emphasizing the need to focus on the problem of hunger.

""We live in a world of abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity. In our society, there is no room or justification for anyone to go hungry, for anyone not to have access to healthy food options,"" the mayor said at the press conference, adding that food is how Mississippians show love in their communities.

""Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. In spaces where people often have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you and provide you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. As a city, we should return the love,"" he said.

3,"Nov 23, 2020",,"Survey: Food Insecurity, Lack of Support Remain Top Challenges for Mississippians Receiving SNAP","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic. A new state survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients finds that Mississippi families need help with food, housing and utilities, especially since government assistance for many families expired earlier this year.

The survey was released by the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP). It found that 66 percent of those surveyed were having trouble buying enough food at some point during the pandemic. Child care issues were cited by 32 percent and the loss of jobs were also cited by 29 percent.

“Food security was a challenge for many Mississippians well before the pandemic, whether it was people struggling to make ends meet in low wage work or who lacked access to fresh food where they lived,” said Sara Miller, policy analyst at the Hope Policy Institute. “As the pandemic brings these issues to a crisis point, families and communities need both near-term recovery efforts and improvements to food systems in our state overall.”

Government assistance has made a real difference, with 51 percent of respondents saying programs or assistance helped. But most of that aid has expired. Organizations like the SPLC Action Fund, Hope Policy Institute, Children’s Defense Fund, Hope Delta and Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Mississippi, Mississippi Center for Justice and the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative are calling for the state and federal government to take these concerns into account and move immediately to provide more assistance.

“What this survey shows is that people need help,” said Brandon Jones, Mississippi policy director for the SPLC Action Fund. “We need the government, both at the state and federal level, to do more to help the people who are suffering because of the pandemic.”

Of the 12 Southern states surveyed, Mississippi was the only state to have SNAP and P-EBT application issues as the greatest challenges. All other Southern states had problems with unemployment insurance or stimulus checks as the top challenge. The share of Mississippi respondents who had problems applying for or receiving SNAP was 10 percentage points higher than the share for all Southern respondents (23% vs. 13%).

“The pandemic has exacerbated poverty in Mississippi and the need for holistic systems of support is urgent,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative. “Mississippians need access to food, child care, housing and employment assistance to rebuild their economic security. Mississippians who received pandemic unemployment benefits were priced out of SNAP and consequently lost food assistance, a glaring example of our fractured safety net.”

The data came from 297 anonymized surveys in Mississippi in August and September. Respondents were invited to answer a mixture of multiple choice and open-ended questions about challenges and changes in the wake of the pandemic, experiences using and applying for government benefits, and recommendations and requests for policymakers.","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic.

4,"Nov 24, 2020",WJTV,Mississippi Food Network aims to address food insecurity in state,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – This holiday season many people are working to feed those in need, but hunger is an issue that for some is an everyday reality.

12 News spoke to the Mississippi Food Network about its role in fighting food insecurity statewide, which has become a problem for 56 percent of seniors and more than 600,000 people.

“Mississippi is a state that has dealt with food insecurity way before the pandemic happened,” said Crystal Alfaro.

Alfaro said she knows what it’s like to not have enough to eat. She said the pandemic has increased the need for many families.

“For not just people who were already dealing with it, but also for people that never imagined in their wildest dreams. So it’s increased the need in ways we would never have imagined, and it’s increased the work that we do.”

In October of 2019, the Mississippi Food network distributed 24 million pounds of food, but this year that number jumped to 37 million.

“We have lots of different programs. We feed citizens, and there are lots of different ways to get involved,” said Alfaro.

Pastor Devon Adams said, “We normally operate every week and sometimes twice a week on every 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturday, and the Mississippi Food Network saw what we were doing and partnered with us, and they have been a blessing to us and the City of Jackson. And I’ve ever found that people come from Clinton and Bolton to get some of this.”

The Mississippi Food Network is continuing to accept volunteers and agency partners. They encourage anyone interested in fighting food insecurity to reach out.

6,"Apr 6, 2020",The Guardian,"In the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, a virus hits home: 'Hunger is rampant'","On the cracked country roads of Lexington, deep in the Mississippi delta, an empty yellow school bus drives slowly, making life-sustaining drop-offs on the way.

Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection. There has been one recorded Covid-19 death in the county, Clinton Cobbins, Lexington’s first African American mayor. But even now the coronavirus still poses a serious threat to life.

In Holmes county consolidated – the school district to which Lexington belongs – every single child qualifies for free school meals, a marker of pervasive poverty. For many, said the superintendent, Dr James L Henderson, breakfast and lunch at school are the only nutritious meals a student will eat in a day. For a few, they are the only meals.

When the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.

Many children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.

“We absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,” he said. “We have to do it on behalf of our children. It’s just that simple. Families are suffering here.”

“If there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we’re providing for all children.

The novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America’s most food-insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food-insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.

As the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages – two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.

‘This is getting so much harder’

His mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.

“With the money that we do have we’ve got to try and pay the bills,” she said. “And when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.”

At the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.

Quick Guide How you can help US food banks in the Covid-19 pandemic Show How to help Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help. Donate money or supplies The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families. If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund. Volunteers Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice. Social media Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.

“This is getting so much harder,” she said. “We’re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.”

Holmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.

Zelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call-in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices – in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.

“I couldn’t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,” she said. “So I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said ‘I’m not paying’. My brain just melted because I was so upset.”

In a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington’s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.

“If people have a problem they should report it to the attorney general of Mississippi,” he said. “We’re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.”

Mississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared with other hotspots in the US – particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.

As the school bus food drop-offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.

“I pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,” Reeves said.

But the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.

“Hunger is rampant here,” said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. “Six hundred thousand were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.”

The network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state’s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.

“We have more phone calls than we can handle,” Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.

‘It’s like a scavenger hunt’

In Jackson, the state’s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods.

Like Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pickup meal service there are no drop-offs here.

April Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.

Volunteers from the Poor People’s Campaign, and Operation Good – a local collective of activists – have been organizing hot food drop-offs at this low-income apartment complex, for the past week.

“It’s like a scavenger hunt,” Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. “People are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.”

She lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.

“I just took it,” she said. “I bought a block of cheese. That was it.”","Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection.

7,"Dec 7, 2020",,Millions of hungry Americans turn to food banks for first time,"The deadly pandemic that tore through the nation’s heartland struck just as Aaron Crawford was in a moment of crisis. He was looking for work, his wife needed surgery, then the virus began eating away at her work hours and her paycheck.

The Crawfords had no savings, mounting bills and a growing dread: What if they ran out of food? The couple had two boys, 5 and 10, and boxes of macaroni and cheese from the dollar store could go only so far.

A 37-year-old Navy vet, Crawford saw himself as self-reliant. Asking for food made him uncomfortable. “I felt like I was a failure,” he says. “It’s this whole stigma … this mindset that you’re this guy who can’t provide for his family, that you’re a deadbeat.”

Hunger is a harsh reality in the richest country in the world. Even during times of prosperity, schools hand out millions of hot meals a day to children, and desperate elderly Americans are sometimes forced to choose between medicine and food.

Now, in the pandemic of 2020, with illness, job loss and business closures, millions more Americans are worried about empty refrigerators and barren cupboards. Food banks are doling out meals at a rapid pace and an Associated Press data analysis found a sharp rise in the amount of food distributed compared with last year. Meanwhile, some folks are skipping meals so their children can eat and others are depending on cheap food that lacks nutrition.

Those fighting hunger say they’ve never seen anything like this in America, even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The first place many Americans are finding relief is a neighborhood food pantry, most connected to vast networks of nonprofits. Tons of food move each day from grocery store discards and government handouts to warehouse distribution centers, and then to the neighborhood charity.

WATCH: America’s hunger crisis grows more severe amid pandemic recession

The Crawfords turned to the Family Resource Centers and Food Shelf, part of 360 Communities, a nonprofit 15 minutes from their apartment in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When needed, they receive monthly boxes of fresh produce, dairy, deli, meat and other basics — enough food to fill two grocery carts. If that runs out, they can get an emergency package to tide them over for the rest of the month.

Crawford’s wife, Sheyla, had insisted they seek help; her hours had been cut at the day care center where she worked. At first, Crawford was embarrassed to go the food shelf; he worried he’d bump into someone he knew. He now sees it differently.

“It didn’t make me a bad man or a terrible husband or father,” he says. “On the contrary, I was actually doing something to make sure that my wife and kids had … food to eat.”

The history books are filled with iconic images of America’s struggles against hunger. Among the most memorable are the Depression-era photos of men standing in breadlines, huddled in long coats and fedoras, their eyes large with fear. An overhead sign reads: “Free Soup. Coffee and a Doughnut for the Unemployed.”

This year’s portrait of hunger has a distinctively bird’s eye view: Enormous traffic jams captured from drone-carrying cameras. Cars inching along, each driver waiting hours for a box or bag of food. From Anaheim, California to San Antonio, Texas to Toledo, Ohio and Orlando, Florida and points in-between, thousands of vehicles carrying hungry people queued up for miles across the horizon. In New York, and other large cities, people stand, waiting for blocks on end.

The newly hungry have similar stories: Their industry collapsed, they lost a job, their hours were cut, an opportunity fell through because of illness.

Handwritten “closed” signs appeared on the windows of stores and restaurants soon after the pandemic arrived. Paychecks shrank or disappeared altogether as unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7 percent, a rate not seen in almost a century.

Food banks felt the pressure almost immediately.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, scrambled to keep up as states locked down and schools — many providing free breakfasts and lunches — closed. In late March, 20 percent of the organization’s 200 food banks were in danger of running out of food.

The problem with supply subsided, but demand has not. Feeding America has never handed out so much food so fast — 4.2 billion meals from March through October. The organization has seen a 60 percent average increase in food bank users during the pandemic: about 4 in 10 are first-timers.

An AP analysis of Feeding America data from 181 food banks in its network found the organization has distributed nearly 57 percent more food in the third quarter of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

There will be no quick decline as the pandemic rages on, having already claimed more than 280,000 lives and infecting 14.7 million people across the nation.

Feeding America estimates those facing hunger will swell to 1 in 6 people, from 35 million in 2019 to more than 50 million by this year’s end. The consequences are even more dire for children — 1 in 4, according to the group.

Some states have been hit especially hard: Nevada, a tourist mecca whose hotel, casino and restaurant industries were battered by the pandemic, is projected to vault from 20th place in 2018 to 5th place this year in food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America.

In four states — Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana — more than 1 in 5 residents are expected to be food insecure by year’s end, meaning they won’t have money or resources to put food on the table, the report said.

In New Orleans one recent Saturday morning, Donna Duerr was waiting to pick up food in a drive-through donation — something that has become part of her routine since COVID-19 swept in last spring.

Her husband was laid off from his job as a pipefitter and she’s unable to work, having undergone two surgeries — one on her spine, the other on her arm — in the last two months. She also has two grown children who’ve moved home since the pandemic began.

“This is a hard thing to accept that you have to do this,” says a weary-sounding Duerr, her throat covered with bandages as the result of a recent operation. Every morning she monitors the local news for announcements of the next food donation; she tries to attend as many as she can, sometimes sharing the food with less-mobile neighbors.

Duerr, 56, faces painful choices. “I either pay bills or get food,” she says, though these donations have brought some relief.

Norman Butler is another first-timer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he and his girlfriend, Cheryl, arrived at 3 a.m. at a drive-through food bank in a suburban New Orleans sports stadium. They joined a pre-dawn procession of mothers with their kids, the elderly and folks like him — unemployed workers.

“You can see the look of uncertainty on their faces,” he says. “Everybody’s just worried about their next meal.”

Before the pandemic, Butler, 53, flourished in the tourism-dominated city, working as an airport shuttle and limousine driver, a valet and hotel doorman. Since March, when the bustling streets turned silent, jobs in the city have been scarce.

“A lot of people are in limbo,” he says. “The main thing we need is to get back to work.”

High cost-of-living

Low-wage employees, many in the service industry, have borne the brunt of economic hardship. But the misery has reached deeper into the workforce.

A September report commissioned by the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, found 1 in 4 of those reporting they didn’t have enough to eat typically had incomes above $50,000 a year before the outbreak.

In Anchorage, Alaska, Brian and Airis Messick were coasting along in full-time jobs for companies that support the state’s oil industry. They were moving toward buying a house.

When March arrived, everything unraveled.

Brian, 28, the newest hire at an electrical wiring company, was laid off. Within a week, Airis, an office worker at an oil well testing firm, lost her job, too.

Then it became a monthly game of deciding who gets paid first with their unemployment checks — the landlord or one of the many bills. They kept their car filled with gas in case they had to move.

The Messicks and their 9-year-old son, Jayden, tried to survive on $50 to $75 a week because, she says, “that’s all we could squeeze.” They turned to a food bank for only the second time — they’d sought help after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.

After that devastation, the Messicks, who’d met in Florida, decided to get a fresh start and move to Alaska, where Airis had grown up.

Airis, who just turned 30, found work in August, ironically, at the state unemployment office. “I hear people’s stories all day,” she says. “I listen to moms cry about not having money to take care of their kids. My heart aches for the people who get denied.”

Brian stays home with Jayden, who is autistic, helping him with school and driving him to appointments. Also part of the family are Cleo, a pit bull-lab mix, and Daisy, a bearded dragon.

Airis earns too much for the family to receive state financial aid. Anchorage’s high cost-of-living, partly fueled by the expense of shipping goods to the nation’s most northern state, makes it harder to economize even with coupons and careful shopping.

She says the family will continue to go to the food bank until the economy improves, which she expects won’t be soon.

There should be better systems in place, she says, to help families.

“I feel great knowing that we’re not alone, that we’re, you know, not out here being the only one suffering but,” she says, “it makes me mad to know my government failed us.”

Communities of color

For communities of color, the pandemic has been a compound disaster with Blacks and Latinos reeling from disproportionately high rates of deaths, infections — and joblessness.

Unemployment surged among Latinos to 18.9 percent this spring, higher than any other racial and ethnic group, according to federal statistics. Though it has since fallen, many are still struggling.

More than 1 in 5 Black and Latino adults with children said as of July 2020 they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat, according to the commissioned report. That was double the rate of white and Asian households. It also found that women, households with children and people of color are at greatest risk of hunger.

Abigail Leocadio, 34, first approached the nonprofit Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, Arizona, during hard times about a decade ago. Her family rebounded and she completed training to become a phlebotomist, landing a job drawing blood specimens for a local lab.

Leocadio was just 7 when her family brought her to the U.S. from their native Cuernavaca, Mexico. She currently is protected from deportation and has a work permit through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

When her husband, a restaurant cook, was laid off earlier in the pandemic, her income — barely more than the $11 state minimum wage — wasn’t enough to cover their expenses.

Though they own a two-bedroom trailer, they pay $500 a month to rent the lot. Add to that as much as $450 in monthly electric bills and internet service so their four kids, 9 to 15, can attend class remotely. Before schools closed, the kids received free breakfasts and lunches on campus.

WATCH: How economic factors are putting people of color at greater risk for coronavirus

“It has been hard feeding all the kiddos daily,” Leocadio said outside the trailer after a recent delivery from the charity of two boxes including canned tomatoes, dried beans, rice, breakfast cereal and the kids’ undisputed favorite: specialty Oreo cookies.

The food, she says, provides less than half of what her family eats in four weeks, but significantly reduces their monthly bill to about $250. Before the pandemic, the family was saving to buy a house, but that money has been wiped out. Her husband, though, is back at work.

“We always figure out things one way or another,” Leocadio says, though she’s worried about the surge in coronavirus cases and what lies ahead. “We really don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Briana Dominguez had been depending on food pantries in the Chicago area since last fall to supplement her groceries. With two sons, ages 3 and 14, it was hard to keep up, even though she and her boyfriend both worked full-time.

“I never thought it would be me,” she says of her visits to the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois. “But you do what you gotta do to survive.”

A series of misfortunes brought them to a turning point.

Dominguez had a miscarriage, and her father lost his job, due to the pandemic. So did her boyfriend, a trucker. In November her company, which sells ceiling tiles for hospitals and other business, eliminated her job with little notice.

Dominguez, 34, who has a small severance, has decided to move to Georgia, where she has family and living costs are lower. Her boyfriend has found work as a customer service representative that he can do from anywhere, though it’s only $13 an hour. She traveled there in early December to scout job possibilities.

“If I don’t do it now,” she says, “I’ll never do it.”

Government assistance

While food banks have become critical during the pandemic, they’re just one path for combating hunger. For every meal from a food bank, a federal program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, provides nine.

Anti-hunger groups have lobbied Congress for a 15 percent increase in maximum food stamp benefits, A similar measure went a long way in digging the nation out of the Great Recession. A stimulus bill passed by the House this spring includes such a provision, but it has been bogged down in partisan squabbling.

“Food banks and food pantries are doing great work,” says Luis Guardia, president of thee Food Research & Action Center. “But they simply cannot do enough to be something of the order of magnitude that we’re seeing right now.”

Many going to food pantries also are receiving food stamps, though eligibility varies among states.

Aaron Crawford says the addition of $550 in food stamps the family started receiving last summer has made a significant difference in their lives.

Others have discovered they couldn’t make it without food help, even with Social Security or other benefits.

Phyllis Marder, 66, had both Social Security and unemployment when she arrived at the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois, where she’s lived in the same bungalow for 20 years.

She’d been supplementing her benefits as an Uber drive, and when the pandemic hit, she helped workers bring home their computers and office gear. After that, she ferried medical and other front-line workers, but that came to an abrupt end with a COVID-19 scare.

At first, Marder, didn’t tell anyone about visiting food pantries. Then she had a change of heart. “Keeping a secret makes things get worse,” she says, “… and makes me feel worse about myself, and so I decided that it was more important to talk about it.”

Marder sometimes shared her food with neighbors and a panhandler on a freeway ramp. But she expects her food bank visits will end soon.

In a few days, she starts a job — courtesy of the pandemic.

She’ll be a coronavirus contract tracer, working remotely for a nearby county.

Moments of relief

As the year nears its end, Crawford is more confident.

The months have been filled with setbacks and successes. Both Crawfords developed mild cases of COVID-19. Sheyla had hysterectomy surgery and was out work without pay for six weeks.

But they’ve rebounded, too.

Crawford has two part-time jobs, one at United Parcel Service, the second as a maintenance worker at a home for the elderly. His wife is back at work at the day care center. And their boys are receiving breakfast and lunch at their school that provides day care.

The financial troubles that brought them to the food bank haven’t disappeared. They still have overdue bills and a car that needs repairs.

But after many dark months, there have been moments of relief. This fall when the couple contracted COVID-19, their sons’ school sent meals and milk to help.

And a friend had an 18-pound turkey delivered for a Thanksgiving feast. It was so big the Crawfords had to figure out how to find room for the leftovers in the refrigerator now stocked with food.

A full fridge, Crawford says, is a welcome sight.

“It just kind of puts you at ease,” he says. “There’s a sense of peace.”

Distributing boxes of food to those in need is a familiar scene during the holidays. But it's a year-round mission for food banks, other nonprofits and volunteers.

Food insecurity has long been an issue in Mississippi.

According to Feeding America's latest Map the Meal Gap snapshot, in 2018 nearly 560,000 people in the state — including 162,000 children — were considered food insecure, meaning they couldn't put enough food on the table for everyone in the household to live a healthy life. Although Texas boasted the highest number of people considered insecure in its state, Mississippi had the highest percentage.

The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. According to Feeding America's research, more than 22% of Mississippi's population is expected to be food insecure due to the virus, the highest rate in the nation.

With more than 8.2% unemployed in Forrest County and 5.9% in Lamar County, nonprofits are seeing an increased demand for assistance.

'They come to us not wanting to ask for food, but they have to'

The Salvation Army in Hattiesburg said it had served 33% more individuals to date this year than in 2019.

The Petal Children's Task Force, a nonprofit in Petal, on Friday gave away 325 boxes of Thanksgiving food to residents living in Petal School District, about 75 more boxes than last year, according to Demaris Lee, Petal Children's Task Force executive director.

""We've been very fortunate that the churches help us out in this area and we purchase food that everyone will get a turkey for Thanksgiving,"" Lee said. ""They'll get a box of food. They'll get bread and extras.""

Lee said the Petal Children's Task Force has seen an increase in need, serving more than 468 families per month in 2020 compared with 360 families in 2019.

""We've got a lot of people who have been cut in hours, some that have lost their jobs, and they come to us not wanting to ask for food, but they have to,"" Lee said. ""That's what we are here for.""

As the need has increased in Petal, so has the need for donations, Lee said.

""We need food,"" she said. ""We can use all kinds of food. We have a cooler. We have a freezer.""

Farmers to Families boxes were 'manna from heaven'

Ann McCullen, executive director of Edwards Street Fellowship Center in Hattiesburg, was contacted in April by the Mississippi Food Network to assist with the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. The statewide network incudes more than 88 organizations and churches in 11 counties in the Pine Belt.

""(The program) was manna from heaven, but that's not the norm, and COVID-19 is not the norm,"" McCullen said.

The program, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture initiated in April amid the pandemic to distribute food to faith-based organizations nationwide, has since ended.

""At that time, they were talking about 1,000 boxes a week to distribute, and between the three largest food network services here — Christian Services, Petal Children's Task Force and Edwards Street Fellowship Center — that wasn't going to supply any of us for a week,"" McCullen said. ""At the time I told them we were seeing about 1,700 families a week.""

For 18 weeks, Edwards Street Fellowship Center coordinated the Farmers to Food Box program with Christian Services.

McCann Memorial Temple in Hattiesburg also participated. Clarissa Creagh, administrator at McCann Memorial Temple, said the church distributed food boxes weekly on Thursdays.

""We had more than 300 people come, and every week I would get a different amount of boxes,"" Creagh said. ""I never got a set amount, but each time I averaged between 200-300 cars.""

Need help? Reach out

McCullen said if anyone has a need for food, they should reach out to local food bank.

9,"May 4, 2018",Mississippi Today,Mississippi still the hungriest state,"For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

“We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.

10,"Dec 6, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Child hunger in Mississippi is real. Let's solve the food insecurity problem.,"Between the great American feast days of Thanksgiving and Christmas seems like the right time to write about child hunger. Our state has a persistent problem with hunger and food insecurity, with over half a million Mississippians regularly struggling to get enough to eat.

Hunger is especially hard on children and Mississippi still has the highest rate of food-insecure children in the US, according to Feeding America. Some regularly miss meals. About half of Mississippi households receiving SNAP federal food assistance include children.

We know that our persistent poverty is largely to blame; 50 of Mississippi’s food-insecure counties have had poverty rates of 20 percent or more for over 30 years. However, policy decisions on both the federal and state levels also affect who gets enough to eat.

A lack of accessible grocery stores plagues large parts of our state. Attempts by Senator David Blount and Rep. Jarvis Dortch in the state Legislature to get bills passed providing tax incentives for opening grocery stores in Food Deserts are regularly killed by lobbyists for the fast-food industry since people eat less fast food if there is a good grocery store nearby.

The current administration in Washington has been looking for ways to cut federal food assistance expenditures, including school lunches and SNAP. Under rules introduced under the Obama administration, all students in a public school or even all the students in a public school district can get free lunches if the percentage of low-income children qualifying for free lunch there is 40 percent or more. The 40 percent can include children on SNAP, children in foster care, and children who are homeless.

Feeding breakfast and lunch to all the children in a public school for free cuts down on paperwork and administrative costs, and makes it easier for school kitchens to provide more appetizing and nutritious meals. And it eliminates student lunch debt. According to the USDA, about 13.7 million schoolchildren attend public schools where everyone eats free. Something good to eat makes it easier for children to concentrate on learning. However, newly proposed rules by the Trump administration would make it harder to qualify for this federal funding and add paperwork.

Several Democratic candidates for president are calling for the expansion of the free school lunch program to all public school students, something that would cost about $19.6 billion a year. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, and Bernie Sanders have all proposed some version of free lunch programs for all public school students. Castro’s plan would also provide low-income students with three meals a day during summer months.

Castro further proposes federal grants to help open grocery stores in food deserts. As many small towns in this state have learned, a grocery store can be a linchpin that not only improves people’s access to fresh and nutritious food and provides good jobs, but also helps other small businesses prosper.

Although food deserts are most often found in rural areas, there are parts of Hinds County, including in Jackson, that qualify as food deserts because there are no nearby grocery stores. Add that to the fact that a full fourth of the people in Hinds County are food insecure. People in food deserts, by definition high poverty areas, can pay up to 37 percent more for the exact same produce as everybody else.

Surely we all agree that it is not good for children to go hungry. It’s not good for children’s brains or general health, or their overall sense of well-being. Children who grow up food insecure are more likely to develop diabetes, high blood pressure, have strokes, have complications during pregnancy, and get cancer.

It is not a hard fix. All it takes is the will to do it.

11,"May 20, 2020",PRNewswire,Feeding America Study Projects Local Food Insecurity Rates Amid Pandemic Could Reach Up To 1 In 3 Adults And 1 In 2 Children,"CHICAGO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will have a devastating impact on people facing hunger across communities nationwide, according to a new study by Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization. This study is the first of its kind to explore how food insecurity rates at the local level may increase in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity analyzes food insecurity rates for the overall population and children by state, county and congressional district. According to the study, communities that had higher rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will continue to struggle more than other areas. Meanwhile, communities with lower rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will tend to see the largest relative increases in food insecurity as a result of the crisis.

Pre-pandemic – and according to the USDA's most recent report on food security in the U.S. – 37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life. However, a recent Feeding America analysis demonstrates that this number is likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children. That means approximately 54 million people (1 in 6 people) may experience food insecurity in 2020, including 18 million children (1 in 4 children).

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

According to The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, the states projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity among the overall population include Mississippi (24.1 percent), Arkansas (22.5 percent), Alabama (22.2 percent), Louisiana (21.7 percent) and New Mexico (20.7 percent). Meanwhile, the states projected to have the highest rates of child food insecurity include Louisiana (34.5 percent), New Mexico (33.9 percent), Nevada (32.9 percent), Mississippi (32.6 percent) and Alabama (32.4 percent). One in three children in these states will likely experience food insecurity this year.

Specific counties projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity this year are:

Jefferson County, MS (34.2 percent for overall population)

(34.2 percent for overall population) Issaquena County, MS (33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children)

(33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children) East Carrol Parish , LA (33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children)

(33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children) Kusilvak Census Area, AK (33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children)

(33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children) Holmes County, MS (32.7 percent for overall population)

(32.7 percent for overall population) Sabine County, TX (49.1 percent for children)

(49.1 percent for children) Zavala County, TX (48.9 percent for children)

Additionally, the counties that may see the highest change in food insecurity rates for the overall population are:

Burke County, ND (157 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(157 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Renville County, ND (131 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(131 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Dickey County, ND (127 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(127 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Loudoun County, VA (125 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(125 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Eagle County, CO (124 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

""More of our neighbors in these communities and beyond are relying in part on charitable food assistance to make ends meet,"" said Babineaux-Fontenot. ""As a result, food banks are facing a 'perfect storm' of surges in demand, declining food donations, fewer volunteers and disruptions to our operating procedures. Regardless of these challenges, we will continue to stay strong and resilient and work our best to help ensure our neighbors have food on the table.""

This new analysis was conducted by building upon the approach Feeding America used in two earlier briefs to predict changes to national food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to changes to poverty and unemployment. The annual projected unemployment rate (11.5%) is within close range of expert estimates when annualized, including those from a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of more than 60 economists as of May (11.6%), the Congressional Budget Office (11.4%), and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (10.3%). To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national unemployment projection for job loss due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

The underlying analysis for the food insecurity projections was conducted by Dr. Craig Gundersen using the model developed for Map the Meal Gap, Feeding America's county-level food insecurity report.

Other key findings from this report regarding the overall population include:

The projected rate of food insecurity is highest for Mississippi (24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018.

(24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018. North Dakota has the lowest projected rate of food insecurity for 2020 at 12.0 percent. Still, it will see the largest increase in food insecurity rates (77 percent) compared to all other states.

In addition to North Dakota , states that are projected to have the highest change in food insecurity rates – from 2018 to 2020 – include Minnesota (60 percent change), Nevada (57 percent change), Wisconsin (57 percent change) and Hawaii (57 percent change).

Other key findings from this report regarding child food insecurity:

California will see the highest increase in the number of children living in food-insecure households (852,730) bringing the total to 2.2 million. Still, Texas will be home to the most children facing food insecurity (2.3 million).

12,1 week ago,Direct Relief,"In Mississippi, Working to Treat Food Insecurity","At one of the oldest community health centers in the country – that’s Delta Health Center in Mississippi – there’s a story about a famous doctor who used to write prescriptions for food.

Dr. Jack Geiger, the founding father of the community health center movement, would send his patients to the grocery store to get healthy food. The grocer would fill the order and send the bill to the health center.

Someone told Geiger that food couldn’t be prescribed. Geiger retorted that the best cure he knew for malnutrition was food.

Robin Boyles, who’s now the chief program planning and development officer at Delta, said that treating food insecurity “really does go back to our very, very early days…You can treat someone for an illness or infection, but if you’re sending them home and they don’t have food to eat and they don’t have clean drinking water and they don’t have sanitation, they’re not going to get well.”

Food insecurity is on the rise across the United States. In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average. A 2019 study from the USDA’s Economic Research Service found that the state had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country – 15.7% of the population experienced it.

And the state’s community health centers are coming together to do something about it – together with the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi and Direct Relief. Direct Relief provided the health center association with a $250,000 grant designed to fight hunger among Mississippi’s most vulnerable.

The result is the Cornbread Cooking Series, a program that’s designed to both increase access to food and teach people how to buy and prepare food that’s healthy and good to eat. Six Mississippi health centers will introduce or build on existing programs around food access and education.

“It’s Southern and everybody loves cornbread…it’s winter and it’s comfort,” said Janice Sherman, the association’s CEO.

But despite the homey name, Sherman is focused on new cooking techniques as well as food access. “I thought it would be an opportunity to really introduce some new areas of spices and things that will really be better for our diets,” she said.

Patients are screened for food insecurity. If they qualify, they’re referred to the program, which provides a combination of education, activities, and food vouchers or other access to healthy, nutritious food.

Sherman explained that health centers, as trusted community resources, are in an especially good position to deliver help and education. “For a provider who’s your doctor to address the fact that you need food is pretty powerful,” she said.

Three health centers participating in the program sat down with Direct Relief to talk about hunger, healthy cooking, and how they’ll use the funding.

For Patients with HIV, Closing the Cracks

At G.A. Carmichael Family Health Center, dietician Kyskie Bolton explained that there are a number of patients who are “dramatically food insecure, but don’t fall into any category where they would get significant assistance.”

In participating in the Cornbread Cooking Series, G.A. Carmichael wanted to focus on the patients who most needed intervention – in this case, by focusing on patients dealing with both food insecurity and HIV/AIDS.

Some of those patients have comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes as well.

Bolton explained that HIV-positive patients often don’t want anyone to know their diagnosis. “They will protect it at all costs, even at the cost of their hunger or nutritional health,” she said. “These are the type of patients who are going to fall through the cracks.”

G.A. Carmichael is preparing videos of healthy cooking techniques – how to prepare vegetables, for example – and a supermarket tour, to show patients who qualify for the program how to shop around the edges of the grocery store for the healthiest food.

The goal, Bolton said, is “increasing their literacy and empowering them to make better decisions so they can utilize what they have.”

The health center is also working with nearby farmers to acquire and distribute produce to patients with chronic diseases – a long-term enterprise that the funding will help them continue. Active participants in the program will also receive vouchers and gift cards to nearby grocery stores.

For Bolton, part of the challenge is reaching a diverse patient population – one that’s both rural and relatively urban, and that includes a range of ethnicities and backgrounds – and produce materials and messaging that will appeal to everyone.

However, the population does have one thing in common: “Most people here are extremely technologically advanced and don’t have much to do with cornbread,” Bolton said.

Reducing Childhood Obesity

For Dr. Wendy Williams, a pediatrician at Coastal Family Health Center, an interest in increasing food access came about when she noticed a correlation between food insecurity and obesity in the children in her practice.

“Until we started asking the questions, I had no idea how pervasive [food insecurity] is down here,” she said. “You can’t get to the bottom of pediatric obesity until you conquer that, or at least make some dents.”

The health center started by planting a vegetable garden to teach kids about healthy food. It met an enthusiastic reception: Williams said that one child described a radish as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen before putting it in his pocket to preserve it. Another was anxious to learn to grow food – his uncle, he told Williams, didn’t have enough to eat.

The Cornbread Cooking Series grant will help Coastal Family Health Center expand its program, reaching out to local farmers to acquire excess produce for patients, and launching a cooking education series.

“Down in the South we like to do things with a lot of fat and salt, so really being cognizant of that and teaching them to use other things to make food taste good,” such as herbs, will be a priority, Williams said. “It’s definitely a mindset. You have to change how people view it.”

The health center also plans to develop food boxes, working with a local food bank to get protein sources for patients and with a produce distributor to get fruits and vegetables.

But throughout it all, the community garden remains a fixture.

“You don’t even think you’re making that big a difference in the community,” Williams said. But feedback from patients – and enthusiasm for what the garden produces – have changed her mind.

“We’re teaching kids that, from the very beginning, they can be self-reliant,” she said.

Going back to the beginning

Between the pandemic and the winter storms that blanketed large swathes of the U.S. in February, need is especially high among Delta Health Center’s patients, said Neuaviska Stidhum, the health center’s chief operating officer and chief nursing officer.

“Right now, we’re in crisis,” she said. “We really want to be able to just get the hunger out, to provide for them so they won’t have that hunger.”

Since the 1960s, Delta Health Center has played a role in alleviating hunger among its patients. The health center currently has six acres of land – cultivated by a local university – that it uses to provide a range of fresh produce, from greens and sweet potatoes to fresh fruits.

Stidhum explained that, while many of their patients qualify for public assistance, it’s often not enough, or too far away to be accessible for people who don’t have transportation.

“It’s really difficult for some of our more rural patients…especially if they don’t have transportation and have to depend on someone else,” Boyles said.

The grant will be used to provide much-needed food vouchers to patients, and health providers will give patients supplemental information about how to choose and eat healthy food that won’t break the bank.

Stidhum has hopes for a kitchen in the health center someday. For the time being, providers will refer patients to cooking videos, health services, and other resources.

“We’re just going back to the beginning, to help the people any way we can,” she said.","In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average.

13,"Nov 25, 2020",Newsweek,"Most Number of People In Need of Food This Thanksgiving Since Great Depression, Data Shows","Over 50 million Americans may be in need of food this Thanksgiving due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many states around the country are reaching Depression-era levels of hunger, according to data from nation's largest hunger-relief organization, Feeding America.

Nationally, that number equates to roughly 1 in 6 adults, and 1 in 4 children in the U.S. who are struggling to meet their basic food needs.

""The numbers are staggering,"" Eugene Cho, CEO of Bread for the World, a religious nonprofit that works to prevent food insecurity, said in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR). ""We're talking 54 million people in our backyards, in our cities, in our nation right now. That's about 1 in 6 Americans,"" he added.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted levels of food insecurity throughout the country, as millions of Americans continue to face income loss and joblessness. In June, a Northwestern University study found that food insecurity during the pandemic had doubled nationally, and tripled for households with children.

This time last year, roughly 35 million people struggled with hunger in the U.S., a number that has increased by nearly 20 million as the pandemic continues to unfold, according to Feeding America.

In a November survey conducted by the hunger relief organization, 80 percent of the 200 nationwide food banks associated with Feeding America have reported an increase in food production this year.

In total, food banks have consistently seen a 60 percent increase in demand compared to November 2019, and continue to require more food and resources to provide to people in need.

In some states, the issue reflects Depression-era levels.

In Texas, one of the hardest-hit states for COVID-19, 1 in 3 Houston households have had a serious issue affording food, and 1 in 5 do not get enough to eat every day, according to NPR.

The CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank told CNBC that his program now feeds 120,000 —or double the number of people—that they normally do. The numbers have gotten so high that they now have to ration food.

In Rhode Island, the Community Food Bank reported that one in four households struggle to put food on the table, the highest it's been since the Great Depression.

In an October report published by the University of Illinois and Feeding America, the states facing the highest levels of food insecurity include Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. In Jefferson County, Mississippi, the food insecurity rate is the highest in the country at 30.4 percent.

The issue has disproportionately effected Black, Native and Hispanic communities. According to a report from National Geographic, of the top 25 counties with the highest projected food insecurity rates, only four have a population where the majority is white.

""This is a story about racial and ethnic disparities—both food insecurity and the story of coronavirus,"" Emily Engelhard, managing director of Feeding America's research unit told National Geographic. ""The populations and geographies that started in the most disadvantageous state of food insecurity are the ones that are getting hit the hardest.""

In April, the unemployment rate during COVID-19 hit its peak at 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression, when it exceeded 25 percent.

As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country and 2020 comes to a close, Americans are pushing for Congress to pass a second round of stimulus relief to help those struggling from income loss, hunger and joblessness.

""Unless policymakers act quickly to respond to the crisis at the scale necessary, we risk the damage to the economy lasting much longer than necessary, particularly for those at the bottom who have been hit the hardest,"" a group of more than 125 economists wrote in their open letter published by the Economic Security Project on Monday.

MPB’s Alexandra Watts reports on how state and local groups are bringing awareness to hunger.

With about 16 percent of households lacking a regular and predictable source of nutritious food, Mississippi has the second highest rate of food insecurity in the country.

David Holben is a professor and director of the Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the University of Mississippi. He said the state bringing attention to this issue means increased awareness of food insecurity in communities.

“I think by increasing awareness to food insecurity that it may hopefully rally the troops so to speak, so that we can get involved in our communities to improve food insecurity,"" Holben said.

The Mississippi Delta is a region dealing with higher rates of food insecurity.

LeBroderick Woods is market manager of Delta Fresh Foods’ mobile market which serves Mound Bayou and surrounding areas.

The mobile market provides fresh produce to families in North Bolivar County. Woods says having access to food is a problem for people in the area.

“Mound Bayou is considered to be somewhat of a food desert because they’re so far away from your nearest Walmart – they have to go to Clarksdale or Cleveland, and if you don’t have transportation that can be a big issue,"" Woods said.

15,5 days ago,GazetteNET,Food & Farm: A ‘HIP’ way to bolster food security,"A few weeks ago, I went with my friend, Kathleen Chapman — or KC, as she’s called — to the February Winter Farmers’ Market at the Northampton Senior Center.

KC is a Southerner, a smart, funny artist and teacher who moved to Northampton from Mississippi in 2019. Shopping with her is always a good reminder of how blessed western Massachusetts is with relative abundance. Mississippi is a state that consistently ranks as the most food insecure in the nation, with a good many of its residents living miles from the nearest grocery store.

KC always remarks on the plenty of the Pioneer Valley, joking sometimes that someone needs to set up a swap between this area and the South, in which the South will ship dogs to Northampton in exchange for food.

The catch, however, is that food, along with everything else, is so much more expensive here than in Mississippi. KC, who lives in senior housing downtown, uses a combination of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — what people used to know as food stamps) and Survival Center groceries to help her stretch her fixed budget. At the Farmers’ Market, she also has access to an additional tool in the form of HIP benefits.

HIP is the Healthy Incentives Program, a state- and USDA-funded program that provides monthly incentives to SNAP households when they purchase fresh local vegetables and fruit at farmers markets, mobile markets, farm shares and farm stands. HIP automatically adds back any SNAP money spent at one of the above outlets, up to a certain amount. So, for instance, the SNAP money KC spends on local produce at the Winter Market is immediately added back to her Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, and, as a household of one, she can spend up to $40 a month on local produce via HIP.

It’s not hard to see how this might benefit the health and well-being of households with limited means. Nutrition research can be fickle and biased, but to my knowledge, there is no study that argues that increasing your daily intake of vegetables will do anything but improve your health outcomes.

And people have been using HIP. Since the program began in 2017, SNAP sales at farm retail outlets increased by a whopping 1,250%; to date, 88,000 families have used their HIP incentives, 45% of whom include seniors, and 30% of whom include children.

The program has been popular enough that the state has periodically had to halt its disbursement of HIP funding because it underestimated the demand for fresh, local produce among its low-income citizens. And besides produce, HIP can also be used to purchase edible plants, so that people who have a bit of growing room can spend their HIP allowance on veggie and herb plant starts, thus increasing their access to fresh produce for an entire season.

If these were the only benefits that accrued to the community via HIP, the program would already be an asset, but its value extends beyond the customers. HIP does a good amount of legwork in the effort to create a more sustainable food system by supporting local farmers as well.

For growers, the cost of organically raising, picking, washing, packaging and distributing produce while stewarding land in a holistic, sustainable way while paying themselves and their workers a living wage is undeniably high.

According to Olivia Pettingill of Wingate Farm, the HIP program has permitted farmers like her to cover their costs while feeding a more economically diverse range of people.

“HIP has significantly enabled a more equal distribution of high-quality produce to our local community,” she says, “and it’s done this while allowing small farmers to stay in business and even thrive.”

She points out that HIP has more lasting effects as well on the kind of general thinking and public curiosity that lead to greater food security. Local farmers try to grow produce and fruits that do well in our local climate, but that doesn’t always mean growing the vegetables that are the most conventionally recognized.

HIP incentivizes people to try different kinds of veggies that are more locally sustainable, and in doing so, it builds a marketplace that relies less on foods from far-flung places, thus reducing the carbon footprint of shipping.

SNAP Match

The program is not without its issues. As mentioned, there have been periods when it shut down for lack of funding, which is confusing and frustrating for those attempting to use their benefits. This inconsistency also limits farmers’ ability to plan, as well as HIP’s ability to make a sustained difference in people’s eating habits.

Also, if you don’t have any SNAP money left on your EBT card, you can’t access your HIP benefits, even though the two amounts are not dependent on each other. And a further issue is that the benefits are pretty specific: You can buy local vegetables and fruit, but other farm products such as eggs or meat aren’t covered.

In an effort to fill that gap, Grow Food Northampton, which operates the Tuesday Farmers’ Market and the current Winter Farmers’ Market, offers SNAP Match, a system in which Grow Food matches the amount of SNAP money an individual spends at the farmers market. (SNAP Match also doubles the match for the first $10 people spend.) In this way, farmers who sell products other than veggies aren’t left out, and people doing their shopping with SNAP benefits are given a wider selection of choices.

It’s rare, I think, to find elegant solutions where food access is concerned, and even rarer when food access, environmental stewardship and the local economy work together in any kind of synergistic fashion, which is why the combination of HIP and SNAP Match — and their potential to help further a smaller, more sustainable, and more equitable food system — is so ingenious.

The majority of SNAP Match is even funded locally, by Valley Home Improvement, which, over the last four years, has doubled the amount of assistance that Grow Food can provide to customers. Steve Silverman, Valley Home Improvement’s founder, says the company is keen on supporting local business and addressing food insecurity as well — values that are complementary and aligned in SNAP Match.

While SNAP Match will continue as long as Grow Food has the money to support it, the proposed state budget for the next fiscal year cuts HIP funding from this year’s $13 million to $5 million in 2022. Given the many benefits to both local farms and families who would otherwise lack access to sustainable fresh local produce, this seems short-sighted from every angle.

Why not keep the momentum going on a program that has demonstrated great potential to positively affect the health of the commonwealth’s most disadvantaged citizens while also allowing local farm businesses to thrive and grow food in a way increases our food security and decreases our carbon footprint?

After the events of the past year, with scary disruptions to the national supply chain due to COVID, it’s in everyone’s interest to take a closer look at the steps we can take to ensure that the bounty that KC remarked upon isn’t jeopardized — and the continued funding of HIP is one of them.

KC, by the way, came away from the Winter Market with beets and onions, eggs, a small amount of bacon for cooking with some dried lima beans, and a jug of maple syrup, which she uses to sweeten her coffee — a nice balance of items good for both body and spirit.

While on occasion the complexity of figuring out the various different systems available to help her access better quality food has been frustrating, she believes absolutely in SNAP Match and HIP as valuable resources that should be funded, and not just for her own sake.

“The vegetables are so expensive at the store that I’m hesitant to buy them,” she told me, “but here [at the Farmer’s Market], I can get these delicious fresh organic vegetables, and it’s helped me a lot. And the fact that the farmers are being supported is the biggest thrill to me.”

16,"Mar 20, 2019",Hattiesburg American,"Hungry for more than an education: College students use food pantries, trying to survive.","CLOSE Social work student Tyesha Christopher talks about reasons why USM students might use the Eagle's Nest food pantry

They don't have enough money to keep up with college expenses and food. They don't have the luxury of ordering pizza or worrying about the freshman 15.

These are college students in Mississippi struggling with food insecurity — where their next meal is coming from. Simple staples like bread and peanut butter, say those who have helped launch campus food pantries, can make the difference between a passing for failing grade — or staying in school and dropping out.

Now, a newly formed statewide group — the College and University Anti-Hunger Alliance — is hoping to get organizations, individuals and community groups to band together to address hunger and food insecurity at colleges and universities.

Its first meeting is being held Friday in Flowood for members of colleges and universities who have opened a food pantry or are contemplating opening one.

How bad is hunger on Mississippi college campuses?

Langston Moore, the Alliance's communication and community engagement director, estimates about half of the state's college students struggle with food insecurity. He bases that on statistics he sees in the state's K-12 population.

""Just in the Jackson Public Schools alone, 100 percent of students qualify for free and reduced lunch,"" he said. ""When they go away to college, those needs don't stop.

""There's no mechanism to replace free and reduced lunch. The students can't afford the (campus) meal ticket.""

Moore's estimate means the problem of campus hunger is worse in Mississippi than around the nation. While there are no studies that look only at Mississippi, one of the most recent national surveys — from the Wisconsin Hope Lab — found 36 percent of university students had limited or uncertain availability of food in the past 30 days, while 42 percent of community college students experienced food insecurity.

Grace Rutledge, a social work intern who works at the Eagle's Nest, the University of Southern Mississippi's food pantry, says about 30-40 students use the food pantry each of the two days a week it's open.

""I know when I first started school, sometimes I didn't plan well when it came to my budget,"" she said. ""I had the luxury of going home and saying, 'Dad, can I have some food?'

""But some people don't have that luxury. They shouldn't be going to college wondering if they can eat that month, but thinking, 'Can I study for this test or can I get an education?'""

What else do we know about campus hunger?

The Hope Lab found:

46 percent of students at four-year institutions can't afford to eat balanced meals.

44 percent worry their food will run out before they get money to buy more.

14 percent have lost weight because there wasn't enough money for food.

Tamara Hurst, Alliance faculty chair (Photo: Special to American)

Tamara Hurst, University of Southern Mississippi school of social work assistant professor and Alliance faculty chair, also estimates those numbers are worse in Mississippi.

""From student and faculty feedback, we are discovering food insecurity is more prevalent than we thought,"" she said. ""It can be (a student's) finances are such that anything can throw them over the edge (and they can't afford food).""

Rutledge sees students and faculty coming into the Eagle's Nest at the end of the month when their paychecks have run out. The most popular items they pick up are bread, shelf-stable milk, peanut butter and spices.

Why is the issue of campus hunger important?

Research shows hunger among college students is often tied to poor academic performance. The Hope Lab found 40 percent of students who were getting Fs reported food insecurity, while 33 percent of those reporting Ds said they were having trouble getting food.

""For anyone who has tried to concentrate on something when they're hungry, it's so difficult,"" Hurst said. ""We want (students) to stay in school and graduate.""

Story continues after photo gallery.

What is the Anti-Hunger Alliance?

It's a group formed under the umbrella of the Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi in Flowood that currently has members that include Hattiesburg's Extra Table, Southern Miss, Jackson State University, Jackson's Sow, Reap, Feed, the Mississippi Center for Justice and the American Heart Association.

One of its first missions will be to work with an Emerging Advocacy Fund Grant from MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger to establish student food pantries at interested college campuses in the state.

Why is the Alliance needed?

Universities and colleges in Mississippi are all very different in their student populations, but are the same in that hunger plays a role on their campuses. They could use some help dealing with this problem, especially in setting up food pantries where students can find a reliable source of shelf-stable food. The first task of the Alliance is to offer advice and assistance in setting up these food pantries.

""(Southern Miss) has been through the ups and downs of running a food pantry,"" Hurst said. ""We can share our experiences and our resources so the campuses don't have to start from scratch.""

What has it done so far?

The Alliance visited the Eagle's Nest in September with officials from several other colleges and universities to see how it serves students. The Eagle's Nest has been open since October 2016 and offers donated food and other necessities to any student who needs them. The Alliance called it a ""model"" in the way it was organized and helps students.

During that visit, officials from Jackson State, who were in the process of setting up a food pantry, considered changing their mind about keeping students to a limited number of food items to allowing them to have what they need as Southern Miss does.

At the time of the Eagle's Nest visit, Moore said, ""Hopefully, we'll be able to duplicate this food pantry across Mississippi."" Moore liked that the Eagle's Nest didn't discriminate on the basis of need, was run by student-volunteers and offered low-fat proteins, low-sugar fruits and other healthy items.

What does it hope to accomplish?

The Alliance hopes to tackle more than just hunger, perhaps setting up emergency funds for students and other resources that can help them stay in school and graduate. But first, it wants to set up a food pantry on every community college and college campus in Mississippi.

Moore said it will take people working together to help because improving access to food and resources for college students is not a solitary endeavor.

""Partnering with others is very successful,"" he said. ""An alliance of people sharing resources is so much better than one person carrying the load.""

A pair of identical bills in both the Senate and the House of the 2020 Legislature sought to push the seiners at least half a mile off Cat Island, the last remaining island they could still fish.

“If they take Cat Island, all that’s left is one other little inside place where there are so many recreational fishermen and all that it gets run over eight or 10 times a day — there’s nothin’ there. And that’s what they’re wantin’ to leave us with,” said haul seiner Martin Young.

The state’s other four barrier islands have been off-limits to commercial fishermen since the 1990s, when managers of the federal Gulf Islands National Seashore pushed them at least one mile away; Cat Island is shared between federal, state and private owners.

“The legislation would make it harder for the average Mississippi consumer to obtain fresh, local sustainable seafood,"" said Ryan Bradley, executive director of the Mississippi Commercial Fishermen United. ""It would be a real food security problem for a state that has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire nation.”

The Coastal Conservation Association’s House Bill 561, sponsored by Rep. Timmy Ladner, passed 118-3 on March 11. The sportsmen’s Senate Bill 2720, sponsored by Sens. Mike Thompson, Scott DeLano and Phillip Moran, passed 50-2 on March 10. The bills had moved to the opposite chambers, but the Legislature shut down before they could be voted on.

Mississippi’s Commission on Marine Resources, the specialized panel charged with managing the state’s coastal resources, opposed the bills in an April 7 resolution to the Legislature: “The two legislative bills will unfairly and inequitably restrict the rights and equal access of the commercial fishing industry to the marine resources of the state of Mississippi,” wrote the five-member panel.

The CCA narrowly missed its target in 2018 when the commission was unable to break a tie vote.

WASHINGTON (CN) — Experts called it critical Monday that a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from leaving nearly 700,000 people without food stamps at a time of rising food insecurity with millions of Americans out of work during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ruling against the Department of Agriculture at summary judgment Sunday, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found that the rule it adopted late last year “radically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice” for administering food stamps through SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Howell slammed the agency as “icily silent” on how its proposal would affect more than 1 million people who receive SNAP benefits during a pandemic that so far has killed nearly 220,00 Americans and quadrupled the national unemployment rate.

Food insecurity is on the rise, meanwhile, and still climbing.

“The main frontline of defense that we have is SNAP,” Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center, told Courthouse News on Monday.

After the Great Recession, it took 10 years for the food-insecurity rate to get back to levels seen before the 2008 economic crash, she added.

“We don’t know exactly what this recovery will look like. But we know from prior experience that it takes a long time for people to dig out,” Waxman said.

Julia Henly, who chairs the doctoral program for the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, agreed that SNAP is proven to reduce food insecurity and is a critical economic support to low-income families.

“This is a time to simplify SNAP access, not make the eligibility process more difficult,” Henly said in an email Monday.

States historically have had the power to waive the work mandates that food-stamp beneficiaries face. Without court intervention, the Trump administration would have made such waivers harder to implement. In a thriving economy, noted Henly, such a move makes little sense.

“But it would be especially poor public policy to reinstate work mandates at a time when over 12 million Americans are unemployed and community food banks are stretched to the limit. This is precisely the time when SNAP benefits are most critical, without making their access conditional on work,” she said.

Economist Robert Hartley likewise called the rule a “strange juxtaposition” to the efforts of Congress, which through the CARES Act has suspended time limits on work requirements for so-called “able-bodied adults without dependents” who are eligible for relief under SNAP.

An estimated 700,000 such adults could have found themselves kicked off food stamps this year if the Trump administration’s rule had held up in court.

SNAP is “perhaps the most accessible and successful support” for American families facing economic hardship, a safety net made all the more valuable during the pandemic, Hartley said in an email.

“Restricting access as proposed would offer small savings in relative terms to government spending, but the personal hardship that would result is significant, especially since individuals’ constraints and health challenges may be difficult to observe as we label who is able-bodied,” said Hartley, who is an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University.

Judge Howell, an Obama appointee, had temporarily blocked the rule set to impose new eligibility requirements from taking effect on April 1, calling SNAP essential. In her 67-page ruling Sunday, Howell wrote that USDA had failed to explain how the changes followed the federal rulemaking process or “make sense.”

Just over the last six months, Howell added, “SNAP rosters have grown by over 17 percent with over 6 million new enrollees.”

While the rule change attempted by the Trump administration had targeted adults without dependents, Waxman noted that many food stamp recipients are noncustodial parents. Even if their children live with another parent, such individuals can still bear financial or caretaking responsibilities.

Waxman called SNAP a critical stimulus program that should not be pared back amid a deadly outbreak whose economic toll remains untold, pointing to research that shows every dollar spent in the program returns anywhere from $1.50 to $1.80 back to the recipient’s community.

“This is a program that helps fuel recoveries,” Waxman said. “It’s just a relief that this is one fewer battle that’ll have to be fought right now.”

The lawsuit was brought in January by attorneys general from 19 states as well as the District of Columbia and New York City.

“At a time of national crisis, this decision is a win for common sense and basic human decency,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a press release Monday. “This Trump administration rule was cruel to its core and ran counter to who we are and what we represent as a nation.”

Hartley noted Monday that New York was the first state to pilot a SNAP Online Purchasing program in 2019 that has rapidly expanded to 47 states since May.

Without SNAP, he added, the country would see “large increases in food insecurity, especially unprecedented spikes in child food insecurity, or else extreme lines at food banks or other distribution centers.”

D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine over Twitter Monday called the proposed rule change “heartless and unlawful,” saying it put the lives of the 700,000 Americans who may have lost SNAP benefits at risk.","(AP Photo/Rogelio V.

21,"May 8, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Mississippi identified as most food insecure state in U.S. - The Vicksburg Post,"By Mississippi Today

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.

22,"May 22, 2020",Marketplace.org,“Record levels” of food insecurity in the U.S. because of COVID-19,"At some point this year, 54 million Americans — including one in four children — may not know where their next meal is coming from.

Food insecurity is rising in every part of the United States, and will continue to throughout 2020, according to new projections out this week from Feeding America.

“These are record levels,” said Emily Engelhard, managing director of research at Feeding America, which has a nationwide network of food banks. “We have not seen food insecurity reach these levels for the length of time that food insecurity has been measured.”

Some of the biggest increases are coming in states that rely heavily on tourism, like Nevada and Hawaii, which have been hit hard by pandemic-related job-losses. And the need is only continuing to grow in the states that had the highest rates of food insecurity before the pandemic, including Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana.

“Sometimes we have a tendency to feel like the issue of food insecurity is not our issue, and that it’s far away. It’s in some other neighborhood, in some other community,” Engelhard said. “But this really shows that it’s in every single community.”

More than 37 million people were already considered food insecure before COVID-19 arrived in the U.S. and devastated the economy — and that was the lowest it had been since before the Great Recession.

Since the earliest days of the pandemic, food banks across the country have been seeing a surge in demand, something they often measure in pounds. One meal is roughly 1.2 pounds, according to Catherine D’Amato, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Before the pandemic, the Greater Boston Food Bank was distributing between 4 and 5 million pounds of food a month, on average.

In March, it distributed 8 million pounds.

In April, 9.5 million pounds.

In May, it’s on track to distribute more than 10 million pounds.

“That’s a very clear indicator that something is different,” D’Amato said. “It’s historic, we’ve never seen anything like this. So there’s no roadmap for us, and we’re kind of building it.”

Projected rates of food insecurity for 2020 by state, according to Feeding America’s report, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Security. (Courtesy Feeding America)

Around 40% of the increase is coming from people who had never been to a food bank before, according to Feeding America — people who have newly lost a job, or are supporting sick family members.

With unemployment continuing to rise every week — nearly 39 million people have applied for benefits for the first time just in the last two months — food banks know that need is only going to continue to increase, and is likely to remain high for a long time.

“Are we going to be in this for five years? Are we going to be in this for three years?” D’Amato said. “We know we’re going to be in this for multiple years simply based on these historic unemployment numbers.”

So far, there has been a surge in donations, both from individuals and corporations, that is helping food banks meet the increase in demand.

But, Engelhard said, “my concern is that this will become a new normal, and that the sort of energy and community support that we’re seeing won’t sustain, even as people continue to be in dire need of support.”

COVID-19 Economy FAQs How are those COVID relief payments affecting consumers? Payments started going out within days of President Joe Biden signing the American Rescue Plan, and that’s been a big shot in the arm for consumers, said John Leer at Morning Consult, which polls Americans every day. “Consumer confidence is really on a tear. They are growing more confident at a faster rate than they have following the prior two stimulus packages.” Leer said this time around the checks are bigger and they’re getting out faster. Now, rising confidence is likely to spark more consumer spending. But Lisa Rowan at Forbes Advisor said it’s not clear how much or how fast. Will more people be working from home once the worst of the pandemic recedes? It’s still unclear whether remote work will remain widespread, but there is at least more data analyzing the costs and benefits of working from home. People might be saving on things like commuting and buying clothes, but they’re also finding that in order to make long-term remote work feasible, they’ll have to upgrade their living spaces. And that cost could outweigh savings. Chris Stanton, a Harvard business professor, said even a minor increase in working from home after the pandemic could add up to billions of dollars a year for workers. I’m hearing a lot about interest rates. Is it getting more expensive to borrow money? Expectations of higher inflation as the economy rebounds have investors demanding higher yields to compensate. In turn, the recent surge in bond yields is pushing up the interest rates consumers pay on mortgages and other loans. Economist Scott Hoyt with Moody’s Analytics said rising rates could dampen demand for housing a little and refinancing a little more. Other kinds of consumer spending are less likely to be affected. Interest on auto loans and credit cards are pegged to shorter-term rates, which haven’t been rising as much.

23,"Oct 11, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,MSU maintains partnership with Nobel Peace Prize winner,"The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

The World Food Program, a United Nations agency, works to provide food for undernourished populations, particularly in countries at war. The MSU Office of Public Affairs issued a congratulatory statement from university president Mark Keenum in a Saturday press release.

“Addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world,” Keenum said. “That is why organizations like the World Food Program are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could bring the number of people facing “acute food insecurity” up to 265 million worldwide, according to an April press release from WFP.

MSU and WFP have worked together since 2010 “on issues related to food safety and nutrition,” MSU Chief Communications Officer Sid Salter said. The two entities signed an agreement in 2014 to focus on “cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development,” according to the press release.

Keenum and two other MSU leaders — Provost David Shaw and Interim Vice President for Research Julie Jordan — with U.N. leaders in Rome in November 2019 to discuss solutions to global food insecurity.

MSU invests $105 million, the eleventh-most nationwide, in agricultural sciences research and development, according to the National Science Foundation.

MSU also is the headquarters and leading institution in the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, an aquaculture research organization funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The lab focuses on building sustainable fish farming systems in countries around the world to alleviate food insecurity.

Keenum is the chairman of both the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. Before becoming MSU’s president in 2009, Keenum was a USDA undersecretary in charge of overseeing international initiatives to combat world hunger.

He wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in January 2016 nominating WFP for that year’s Nobel Peace Prize. In the letter, which Salter provided to The Dispatch, Keenum pointed out WFP’s work to provide “millions of healthy school meals and supplementary nutrition” to children suffering from nutrient deficiencies “in the most destitute parts of the world.”

“All of us, and particularly the developed countries, have a moral obligation to address the persistent human tragedy of hunger and its associated ills,” Keenum wrote. “We must also recognize that lasting peace among and within nations is likely impossible while large populations remain at risk of starvation.”

WFP provided nutritional assistance to nearly 100 million people in 88 countries in 2019, with some of its largest efforts focused on Yemen and South Sudan. Founded in 1961, the organization has helped populations affected by a range of humanitarian crises, including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and wars in the Balkan region of Eastern Europe in the 1990s.","The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.

25,"Jun 10, 2020",Civil Eats,"‘Fertile Ground’ Explores How Jackson, Mississippi, Is Charting a Better Food Future","Obesity. Poverty. Food Insecurity.

Mississippi has the dubious distinction of ranking high nationally in each of these interlinked categories. With the exception of New Mexico, the Magnolia State is the most food insecure place in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents. The film, directed by Alex Warren, with executive producer Robby Piantanida, airs tonight at 7 p.m. Central Time on Mississippi PBS and is also available online at PBS.org.

“There is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement about the film. “In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people.”

Fertile Ground, which was funded in part by a grant from the Bloomberg Foundation, shows how historic redlining—a practice in which banks prevented people of color from buying mortgages in white neighborhoods—resulted in the mostly Black and impoverished neighborhood of South Jackson having few grocery stores but several convenience stores with low-quality food. The city’s car culture and lack of sidewalks and bicycle lanes add to the problem, making it a herculean task for residents without vehicles to obtain nutrient-rich food. And children in Jackson’s most economically disadvantaged areas rely on school cafeterias to get balanced meals. In Mississippi, 1 in 4 children experiences hunger, compared to 1 in 5 adults.

In the wake of these challenges, urban farms, city planning projects, farm-to-table restaurants, and efforts to provide residents with locally grown food offer hope that food equality in Jackson is possible. Fertile Ground isn’t just a film, but an initiative that aims to shape policy and public dialogue about food access and nutrition through art, workshops, panel discussions, and other events.

Civil Eats spoke with Jackson chef Enrika Williams, a Fertile Ground workshop facilitator, and Travis Crabtree, a Jackson-based urban designer and Fertile Ground project manager, about the new documentary, redlining, urban farming, and the food inequities their city faces.

How does the layout of Jackson contribute to food inequality?

Travis Crabtree. Travis Crabtree.

Travis Crabtree: Whenever you have a city that is extremely car oriented, obviously you have accessibility issues, especially when you have neighborhoods that don’t have good public transportation, low car ownership, and no sidewalks—which is the reality for a lot of Jackson. Jackson started being built from the core, which is downtown Jackson, and then over time, you had white flight and people started to leave the city. That’s when all the grocery stores left.

It’s a very typical pattern in American cities. It has happened all over the country, but Jackson is a place that’s already dealing with extreme poverty, racial tensions, and [less] access to resources. When it comes to food insecurity, it’s super exacerbated here.

The documentary discusses how poverty in some Jackson neighborhoods played a role in supermarkets leaving. Why do you think that is?

Enrika Williams. Enrika Williams.

Enrika Williams: You can find plenty of convenience stores that have decided to take EBT because people in the community who are using food assistance need a place to spend their money so they can eat. But the larger grocery store chains are in the business of making money, and capitalists are not empathetic to anything but . . . making money. So, if the majority of the people who come into your stores are on some sort of public assistance, you look at the bottom line and think, “I’m not making any money.”

I also think there’s a stigma attached to public assistance recipients. Stores don’t want to appear to be accommodating to a demographic of EBT recipients. There’s also an insurance standpoint: It costs more to put your grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. It’s like another form of redlining.

How does the history of redlining play a role in the city’s present-day food landscape?

Crabtree: It’s really clear what lines divide Jackson—the train yard, the interstate, and these other sorts of urban barriers, even institutions like colleges or hospitals. They act as really large barriers that are disconnecting the white neighborhoods from Black neighborhoods. And generally the white neighborhoods are the ones that have the grocery stores and are more affluent.

Redlining obviously exists in most American cities, but it’s so apparent here. One thing that we’ve done outside of the documentary is we have a major public art component. We’ve tried to position our public art installations at the intersections of the redlines to bring the two communities together. We’re putting them right up against the railroad tracks and the different sort of segregation points to try to have conversations about what an integrated Jackson would be like.","The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents.

27,"Dec 26, 2018",Mississippi Today,Gloster’s first grocery store in decades highlights statewide food insecurity,"GLOSTER — For residents here, food excursions would range from the 30 minute round-trip to Centreville, to the 2-hour round-trip to Baton Rouge, La. The nearest Walmart and Kroger, over in McComb, are roughly an hour’s drive each way.

A small rural town in Amite County, Gloster is just south of the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi; it’s less than two square miles in size and home to around a thousand residents, according to the 2016 American Community Survey.

Companies are scared, despite minimal competition, that they won’t make enough of a profit to survive in towns with a small consumer base — towns like Gloster. In a sparsely populated state like Mississippi, this is a common dilemma, especially when it comes to access to food.

But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving. The town’s first grocery store in decades.

“We needed this,” said Felecia Nayland, 56, who’s lived in Gloster all her life. I just hope and pray that they continue to do good business here so they’ll stay here.”

Nayland said previously, access to fruits and vegetables in town was “pretty much non-existent.”

Limited access to grocery stores in rural areas is one reason Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Over half a million Mississippians did not know where their next meal would come from between 2015 and 2017, according to the latest report from Hunger Free America, “The Red, White, and Blue Hunger Wave: A 2018 United States Hunger Atlas.”

Many here see the public-private partnership that brought the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Gloster as part of the solution to an all-too-common problem in rural towns around the state — availability of affordable, fresh food.

Lavonne Sanders, 50, has also lived in Gloster her whole life, and said the last time the town had a store like this was when she was a little girl, about 30-40 years ago. That too was a Piggly Wiggly.

“I love this store, it’s made a big change,” Sanders said. “We don’t have to go Centreville anymore. You don’t have to spend that gas money now.”

While the store licenses the Piggly Wiggly brand, the shop itself is independently owned and operated by Jason Cook. Cook, from Hattiesburg, learned about Gloster a few years ago while at a previous job. The company was considering expansion into the small town, but in the end opted against it. Since then, Cook opened a Piggly Wiggly in Angie, La. — but he didn’t forget about Gloster.

“I came back here when I was financially able to,” Cook said, “just because after having talks with the community I knew how bad it was here. So the Lord led us back here.

“Most companies will turn their nose up at a store doing under $100,000 a week in sales. My approach is a little different; I do it to operate a business, but I also do it out of just having humanity and compassion. The way I do things aren’t necessarily the way anyone else does them.”

The city approved a tax incentive for the store, which will reimburse Cook for exterior improvements like the parking lot and sidewalk repair. Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened. The store created 22 jobs.

“If you can get into a town where the government will help you get established there to lower your overhead (cost), then you can make it,” Cook said. “You don’t get greedy, and you don’t take advantage of people, you just operate. I live within my means. I’ve got to make a profit in order to pay the bills, but I’m not trying to become a millionaire off of it.”

After years of driving out of town, often out of county, to find fresh produce and essentials, residents were prepared to fill Piggly Wiggly; by 3 p.m. on a Monday, the grocery store was the busiest place in Gloster.

“It’s brought some life back to the town,” said Rachel Stevens, 54, who works at a business on Main St. around the corner from the new store.

Stevens and other residents discussed having to cram all their grocery shopping into a couple trips a month.

“We’d have to stock up. It’s really inconvenient when you run out of stuff. We had no choice, no options,” she added.

More than just the convenience, residents think the Piggly Wiggly will lift spirits and create momentum for the town.

“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago. “I knew it was hyped up when people, even in the other counties, would say, ‘Did you hear about the Piggly Wiggly?’ It’s the biggest thing in a long time in this area.”

“It’s gonna be some more changes coming,” Sanders said. “I believe.”

“To hear over the course of several years how badly a grocery store was needed and wanted in the town, and now that the town finally has it, it really is a feeling of bliss and happiness,” said Rep. Angela Cockerham, D-Magnolia, who represents Amite County.

Cockerham, an attorney at Wise Carter, also serves as Gloster’s lawyer. She added that the incentives Piggly Wiggly received could help attract business in other places in Mississippi.

“In the future, I’m hoping that there will be other mechanisms that will help areas like Southwest Mississippi that encourage partnership (between towns and businesses),” she said.

Statewide solutions and the Legislature’s role

Much of the state — about 1 in 5, according to Hunger Free America — struggle with consistent access to nutritional food.

The phenomenon ranges from urban areas, like Hinds County, where 1 in 4 are food insecure, to rural areas like Jefferson County, which had the highest food insecurity rate in the country in 2016 at 36 percent, according to Feeding America.

Can the public-private partnership in Gloster work in the rest of the state? What can the state Legislature do to help?

Every year, lawmakers propose legislation ultimately aimed at reducing food insecurity by either helping grocers located in low-income communities mitigate losses or making groceries more affordable for the general public.

Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Jackson, has pushed for legislation to give tax credits to grocers locating in underserved communities. A 2018 bill would have given these stores a job tax credit equaling 10 percent of its payroll.

Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, authored a 2018 bill to give income tax credits to grocers to offset the cost of purchasing locally grown produce in an attempt to incentivize stores offering healthier food options.

Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, has introduced bills for the last several years to allow state funds to be used as a direct source of funding for grocery stores under the Small Business and Grocer Investment Act passed in 2014.

Each of these bills died in committee with little fanfare.

Simmons said his proposal to use state dollars directly is unlikely to garner the support of leadership. Tax incentives, similar to those Mississippi gives large companies like Nissan and Continental Tire, might be more palatable, Simmons said.

Right now, Mississippi is leveraging tax incentives for industries to locate in the state, but those benefits do not apply to businesses like grocers.

“Because of the number of employees, the kind of wages they’re paying, (grocers) wouldn’t qualify for the same type of incentives that an industry would,” Simmons said.

The federal government’s primary vehicle for providing at least some food to the poor is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly allowances based on the size of the recipient’s household. Mississippi has one of the largest federal matches of any state for these assistance programs.

“We in Mississippi have depended so much on the federal government to feed the hungry in the state that we ourselves are not focused on it,” Simmons said. “We have not stepped up to the plate to give adequate dollars to match that to help those citizens out of their particular situation … We’ve not had to.”

To slightly ease the burden of affording groceries for Mississippi residents, Rep. Jeramey Anderson, D-Escatawpa, repeatedly proposes legislation to remove the sales tax levied on food items for all shoppers. SNAP purchases are already exempt from sales tax. A version of the same bill from Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, would have also increased all other sales tax from seven to nine percent.

“In my opinion, the best way to provide a tax cut to our constituents, especially those in the middle and working class, is to eliminate this sales tax (on food),” said Anderson, who plans on reintroducing the bill next session. “And I know that of course there has to be a make-up of the revenue lost from taxes on groceries, but I think phasing it out, which is what this bill does over five years, is a responsible way of doing that without hitting the state’s revenue so hard. I think the sales tax on groceries is one of, if not the most, regressive taxes we have.”

Both bills also died, as well as several bills to raise the state minimum wage, which currently mirrors the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, to between $8.25 and $10.10.

Considering low wages across the state, Mississippi families cannot always rely on a job to provide food security. The “U.S. Hunger Atlas” also shows that nearly 13 percent of working adults, or 156,213 employees, also faced food insecurity between 2015 and 2017.

The report also calculated that Mississippi residents would need to spend an additional $273 million each year on food to meet their basic nutritional needs. That’s roughly one-third the amount Mississippi spent, $841.8 million, through the SNAP program in 2017.

“When you get into a situation and you do it for so long, it just becomes a way of life,” Simmons said. “If we do more at the state level, we could actually become a state of change, where we are transitioning our people from poverty to prosperity.”

At the Mississippi Center for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on racial and economic issues, Madeline Morcelle and Kathryn Rehner promote a wide-range of solutions to tackle the root causes of food insecurity.

“In order to achieve a food secure Mississippi, the state legislature will need to take on a broad range of social, economic, and physical barriers to healthy food access,” Morcelle said. “Those include everything from poverty, which is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of people still aren’t paid a living wage; measures to improve the minimum wage would improve food security. I think tax incentives and other measures to incentivize investments from food retailers are important.

“Ultimately, though, there isn’t one solution. It will take a combination of state reform addressing the multiplicity of factors that result in food insecurity, from lack of transportation, to inadequate income, to lack of opportunity in many communities, to protecting and strengthening our essential nutritional assistance programs like SNAP that provide that emergency lifeline to struggling families.”","But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving.

29,"Nov 12, 2020",,Some U.S. states hit harder by COVID-19 food insecurity,"Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic. But large regional differences exist in the severity of the impact.

Experts project over 50 million Americans will be food insecure in 2020, including about 17 million children, says Craig Gundersen, ACES distinguished professor in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois.

Gundersen estimated food insecurity using Map the Meal Gap, an interactive model he developed for Feeding America, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks in the U.S. For the current report, he combined MMG data with projected unemployment numbers.

""One of the key things about COVID-19 is how there's differential impacts across the country and by demographic groups. People with college education generally have not seen much of an impact on either unemployment rates or incomes. However, people in lower-wage jobs tend to be impacted a lot more,"" Gundersen states. ""We would expect greater impact of COVID-19 in areas with a high concentration of service industry jobs.""

The report finds the hardest hit states are the same as before the pandemic -- Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico - but with higher rates. Jefferson County, Mississippi, has the highest food insecurity rate, 30.4%, in the country.

However, the pandemic disproportionately affected other states. For example, Nevada jumped from 20th to eighth highest food insecurity rate by state.

""Areas like Nevada, which has a strong emphasis on the service industry and tourism, will have substantially higher rates of increase in food insecurity than areas with fewer service sector workers,"" Gundersen says.

These findings can help direct relief efforts, he notes.

""Resources should continue to be directed towards those areas with greater needs before, during, and after COVID-19. But we also have to recognize that during the pandemic situation there are areas of the country, such as Nevada, which may need more emergency assistance in the near term,"" Gundersen says.

""Furthermore, some of these jobs may not come back; tourism may be permanently down in the United States. So these impacts could also have longer term ramifications,"" he concludes.","Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nationally, 72% of those 17 to 24 years old are not able to qualify for the military due to lack of education, criminal background, substance abuse or medical disqualifiers. Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility in the nation, with 76% of eligible 17- to 24- year-olds not being able to qualify, said retired Army Brig. Gen. Roger Shields.

Obesity is one of the leading disqualifiers, he said. Twenty-five percent of 10- to 17- year-olds were obese in the state in 2018, while 40% of adults were obese.

""We believe that America must prioritize efforts to combat childhood obesity as a matter of national security,"" Shields said in a written statement released after the roundtable. ""Improving access to fresh and nutritious foods for all children will help reduce childhood obesity and ultimately ensure that the military has a pool of recruits.""

There is a ""network"" of federal nutrition programs available across Mississippi working to combat the issue but many don't know what is available to them, said retired Army Maj. Gen. Augustus Collins, a former adjutant general of Mississippi.

Collins cited the National School Lunch Program, Summer Food Service Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

According to the Mission: Readiness report, in 1945, Gen. Lewis Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, testified in front of Congress that at least 40% of recruits were rejected during World War II for reasons released to poor nutrition.

The National School Lunch program was founded the following year ""to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals,"" Collins said.

Recalling Hershey's testimony, Collins said, ""The lack of nutritious food for our children is actually a threat to national security.""

""It was back in World War II and it is today,"" he said.

Statistics: Nutrition, obesity and the military

In Mississippi, 76% of youth between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot serve in the military due to issues such as lack of education, a record of crime or substance abuse, or medical disqualifiers; higher than the national average of 71%.

Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility among all 50 states.

Obesity is one of the main medical disqualifiers. Individuals who would otherwise be eligible to serve in the military are being disqualified due to excess weight.

In Mississippi, nearly 40% of adults and 25% of children ages 10-17 were obese in 2018, the highest in the nation. In some counties, the percentage increases to 45.

Mississippi has the second highest rate of child food insecurity in the country. In 2016, over 24% of Mississippi children experienced food insecurity. The national average is 18 percent.

Between 2015 and 2017, over 17% of all households in Mississippi experienced food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at a higher rate for obesity.

Mississippi has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country at 17%.

In Mississippi, 37,000 participants, or 7% of National School Lunch Program participants, accessed the Summer Food Service Program, meaning a large majority of students may not have access to healthy food during the summer break.

The hardest-hit groups are Black and Latino households, as well as low-income individuals.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Food insecurity is nothing new in the US, but the coronavirus pandemic has exasperated the problem.

Mass layoffs and furloughs have led to more Americans unsure about how they will put food on the table in the coming months.

A pre-pandemic study by the USDA shows ""37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life.""

Based of data from that study, Feeding America estimates the number is "" likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children.""

These disparities are drawn between strong racial and economic divides.

In the US, Latino residents are two times more likely to suffer from food inequality than their white counterparts; Black residents are two-and-a-half times more likely.

This goes hand-in-hand with food deserts, which are more common in areas with a large Latino or Black population.

""It's not new, even though with COVID-19 we've seen an increase in food insecurity overall, and it seems like people of color again are disproportionately impacted,"" Angela Odoms-Young, associate professor in the department of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Bloomberg.

""Eight of the 10 counties with the highest food-insecurity rates are more than 60% Black,"" according to the Feeding America report.

Jefferson County, Mississippi, and Issaquena County, Mississippi will experience the highest rates of food insecurity this year, at 34.2% and 33.9%, respectively. This comes after Issaquena County didn't report a single case of coronavirus until after May 1.

Mississippi also has some of the lowest unemployment benefits in the US, at an average of $213 a week.

There is also no sign of relief coming soon. The federal unemployment benefit of $600 a week lapsed at the end of July, and Congress has not yet signed a deal for a new stimulus package.","54 million people in the US will face food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America.

36,"Dec 1, 2020",Ole Miss News,Center for Population Studies and Partners Host Hunger Summit,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s Center for Population Studies has partnered with two regional community organizations to launch the 2020 Hunger Summit, which provides a venue for community organizations and their partners to share information and support during the pandemic.

Partners in the effort are the Delta Directions Consortium and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. Starting in September, the Hunger Summit has convened the first Thursday of each month via Zoom.

“The Hunger Summit has been a great success,” said Terrence Hunter, fellow of the Delta Directions Consortium and alumnus of the Ole Miss School of Law who has moderated each of the sessions. “It is amazing seeing so many food pantries and food banks come together with a unified mission: combating food insecurity in the Mississippi Delta in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The concept for the Hunger Summit stems from a previous collaboration between the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Center for Population Studies. The first Desoto County Hunger Summit was held in Hernando in 2017.

This year’s summit was born out of a broader initiative between foundations and university entities to find out how food pantries and nonprofits were operating in the midst of the pandemic. The Maddox Foundation, Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi, partners within the Delta Directions Consortium and the UM Community First Research Center for Wellbeing and Creative Achievement joined forces to conduct social science, public health and legal research that would help pantries and other organizations providing food assistance to Mississippi families.

Before the pandemic, the Center for Population Studies, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi were already collaborating to identify challenges and opportunities in several north Mississippi communities, with the goal of building capacity and promoting community health and well-being.

With the onset of the pandemic, the focus narrowed to the critical and time-sensitive issues of addressing food insecurity and hunger in these communities.

“What began as a project for the future really turned out to be extremely impactful in the present,” said Robin Hurdle, president and CEO of the Maddox Foundation. “As schools and businesses closed, emergency resources and critical funding were desperately needed, and the homework done by so many for our original proposal laid the groundwork necessary to make the FEED Fund possible.”

The FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund was established at the Community Foundation to enable pantries and nonprofits to become self-sustaining.

Through the fund, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi have worked to raise and distribute money to allow food pantries and other organizations to serve more Mississippians in need and invest in their future. The fund has granted nearly $800,000 to nonprofits that are working to meet the academic, educational and nutritional needs of children.

With the Hunger Summit, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Delta Directions Consortium have been able to bring donors and nonprofits together to find innovative ways to meet the needs that Mississippians are experiencing as a result of the pandemic.

“The Hunger Summit has brought synergy to the foundation’s efforts to address the food insecurity needs in our region,” said Keith Fulcher, president of the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. “Partnerships have been formed with state, national and even international organizations whose mission is to feed the hungry. We could not have made these connections without the leadership of Delta Directions.”

The Community Foundation serves 11 counties in northwest Mississippi, assisting and connecting donors and nonprofit organizations and charitable causes.

The Delta Directions Consortium is an alliance of individuals, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and foundations committed to creating positive social change in the Mississippi Delta region. John Green, senior research associate at the Center for Population Studies, serves as a coordinator for this multi-institutional consortium.

Each 2020 Hunger Summit meeting presents relevant information or data to community partners, while providing a space for them to share challenges and successes. Participants have learned about the CARES Act reimbursement grant for food pantries and nonprofits, the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program, and federal and state food donation policies.

Hunger Summit and FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund research has included both the Center for Population Studies and the Harvard Law School’s Food Law and Policy Clinic – also a Delta Directions partner – with faculty, staff and students involved in presentations.

The final meeting of the 2020 Hunger Summit is set for 12:30 p.m. Thursday (Dec. 3). The summit is open to all who have an interest in best practices for meeting food assistance needs during these challenging times.

37,"Mar 23, 2018",,Mississippi high school students participate in World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute,"Contact: Vanessa Beeson

STARKVILLE, Miss. —More than a dozen high school students participated in the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute on Friday [March 23] at Mississippi State University.

Hosted by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, students from across Mississippi spent the day engaged in conversation about global food security with their peers, teachers, MSU faculty and administrators and various food security experts.

Attendees were officially designated Borlaug Scholars for their participation and are eligible for scholarships to Mississippi State University. The Borlaug Scholars pay tribute to the World Food Prize’s founder Norman E. Borlaug. To become a Borlaug Scholar, each student wrote a research paper about a developing country and a food security topic. Each project included innovative ways to improve global food security. The students presented their findings at the on-campus event.

“The Mississippi Youth Institute is a partnership program with the World Food Prize. It challenges high school students to explore the world’s most pressing issues related to food security,” said Libby Crimmings, the World Food Prize’s national education program director. “The World Food Prize’s founder, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was passionate about working with students. He believed if you want people solving these challenges when they are 60 years old, they have to be thinking about it when they are 16 years old.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a global food security champion, welcomed the students in an opening session.

“By 2050, the world population will surpass 10 billion. That means we will need to feed an additional 3 billion people at our global dinner table by the time this class of Borlaug Scholars reaches their 40s,” Keenum said. “That’s why we need young talented students like this who take an interest in the future of the world to try and make a difference, serve humanity and address these critical challenges.”

“It’s also why Mississippi State, as a leading land-grant research institution trained on improving food security on a global scale, is tackling many of these problems today. We are trying to address these challenges through science and research to figure out how we can advance productivity so we can feed the world.” Keenum added.

Scott Willard, associate dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, along with support from the entire MSU Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine administration, has been instrumental in seeing this institute come to fruition.

“Our college is thrilled to host the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute. Achieving global food security is essential as it becomes evident that we must feed more people with fewer resources,” Willard said. “This program provides a platform for high school students to formulate novel solutions to help solve one of the most pressing needs of their generation.”

Students also attended the college’s Charles E. Lindley Lecture. Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, presented on hunger in the Magnolia State. His presentation, “Mississippi: The Hungriest State in the Nation” explained how MFN is addressing food insecurity.

Top students from World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute will be invited to the Global Youth Institute in Iowa in October. Participating students also are eligible to apply to the Borlaug Ruan International Internship and the USDA Wallace-Carver Fellowship.

38,"Jun 10, 2020",Mississippi Today,How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemic,"‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemic

June 10, 2020

When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

“It wasn’t, ‘Oh my gosh how are we going to teach these kids?’ It was, ‘Oh my gosh these kids are going to starve without these meals,’” said Sunny Baker, co-director of the Mississippi Farm to School Network.

Before coronavirus, schools were a dependable place for thousands of children to receive a free and nutritious breakfast and lunch. The pandemic made this service even more crucial, as school buildings closed this spring and the virus wreaked havoc on the state and the nation’s economy, putting many parents’ jobs and economic futures in peril.

In Mississippi, 75 percent of children qualify for free or reduced meals, which means they live in households with income levels between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line. Because of this, the majority of children are dependent on the free breakfast and lunch they get at school everyday. When schools abruptly closed, so did that food supply.

“We just have such a large population in Mississippi of students who depend on those meals,” said Scott Clements, state director of child nutrition at the Mississippi Department of Education. “That breakfast and that lunch is the most nutritious meal they’ll get and in some cases, the only meal they’ll get during the course of the day.”

Gov. Tate Reeves made the decision to close school buildings and switch to distance learning on March 19, which means most school districts sprung into action immediately upon their return from spring break.

In the weeks since, school nutrition departments have had to pivot to alternative methods to ensure students receive food, whether it be a grab-and-go format, school bus door stop delivery, or drive-up exchanges.

More than 4.65 million meals have been served from mid-March through April (May figures are not available yet), Clements said. On any given day during the academic year, more than 100 school districts offered grab-and-go meals at more than 350 sites, not counting the 14 nonprofits that served meals at an additional 53 sites. Schools are still serving during the summer; the number of districts and sites change daily, as schools are constantly making decisions about which locations and days of the week to continue serving while also keeping workers and families safe.

“We say that all the time during the course of the school year, we really love to see a child eat breakfast in the morning because they’re better prepared to learn that day,” Clements said. “We like to see them eat lunch because they’re not going to be hungry and distracted in the afternoon. The same goes for right now — we’re trying to do distance learning and I think it’s important to make sure the nutrition is right so that they are healthy and even though (learning) shifted to home, they’re still able to learn.”

In some cases, local school districts have stopped serving meals because of the coronavirus. The West Bolivar School District, for example, paused delivery for about a month for this reason. They were delivering meals to students along the bus route in an effort to reach kids in the most rural areas of the county. But when one of the food service staff contracted the coronavirus, the meal provisions had to stop immediately, said Jackie Lloyd, school board president.

Small towns that West Bolivar School District served like Shaw — where the only sources of food are one restaurant, two gas stations, and a Dollar General — were suddenly left to figure out how to bridge the gap of keeping kids fed.

“You go to [Dollar General] one day, the shelves are just bare. It’s a whole community of people trying to get the small amount that’s available. So it’s very hard for them, especially our elderly, to be able to survive and get adequate nutrition that they need during this time,” said Cora Jackson, who was born and raised in Shaw.

In Shaw’s case, the nonprofit Delta Hands for Hope stepped in.

“Delta Hands for Hope has been a pillar in Shaw for the past five to six years. Because our focus is on youth, there’s no way that I could not do something for these children,” said Chiquikta Fountain, executive director and sole employee of Delta Hands for Hope.

From Day One volunteers like Jackson, her husband, and a group of students showed up to assemble meals. Donors contributed money and meal boxes toward the effort. Delta Hands for Hope, which before the pandemic provided children with educational resources after school, now serves lunch to around 65 kids three days a week. Even with these efforts, they’re still not able to reach all of the children in Shaw who are enrolled in West Bolivar School District.

While the need for a reliable, nutritious food source has become a glaring issue during the time of this pandemic, the problem of food insecurity is not new.

“Food pantries are an emergency solution to a huge problem here. They’re a Band-Aid. All of this hunger talk and hunger work to me is going to be for naught if we’re not talking about changing the system in which hunger exists,” Baker, the co-director of Mississippi Farm to School Network, said.

That system in which hunger exists hinges on long-held economic policies that don’t promote the buying and selling of locally grown produce.

Mississippi’s agricultural “focus on export commodities appears to have led state officials, and educational institutions, to overlook the potential for creating new economic activity — and farm and food business ownership — through local foods,” states a report produced for the Mississippi Food Policy Council.

The same report estimates that Mississippi imports nearly 90 percent of its food, while exporting on a large scale commodity crops that have to be processed, like soybeans.

“We have this incredibly rich soil. The Mississippi Delta is the richest soil in the country. And we’re not growing food there. We’re growing commodity crops — stuff that people can’t eat,” Baker said. “We’re not supporting small scale farmers. In fact, there are many policies and legislation that prevent small farmers from doing what they need to do.”

This is just one of the factors contributing to what is commonly referred to as hunger in Mississippi. In this sense, hunger doesn’t necessarily mean starving to death. It means not knowing where the next meal will come from or not being able to access healthy, affordable food.

“There are people here who may not be starving like we see on TV where you have children who are malnourished. Starvation looks a different way. Having access to food looks totally different than what you think it does … There’s food, but it’s processed food. You may even have cooked food (from a gas station or restaurant), but you don’t know where that came from,” Fountain said.

Eddye Johnson, food service director in the Coahoma County School District, is also well aware of this problem. She knew it would be hard for students to get a nutritious meal — her concerns stemmed from the lack of healthy meals students eat rather than access to the food itself.

“A lot of these children can’t go in there and cook, so they might be hungry or eating (Ramen) noodles up until their parents come home. Every now and then I think about that. I try to do my best to make sure I do all I can to make sure each child gets a decent meal and something nutritious,” Johnson said.

On a statewide level, the department of education worked with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to secure additional funding for families. The Pandemic EBT Program (P-EBT) was passed by the federal government in March as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and gives the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture the authority to approve statewide plans for temporary assistance to ensure that “children continue to have access to nutritious meals despite this national emergency.”

To date, 41 states have been approved, Mississippi included. The program serves 340,980 students to the tune of $90 million, or about $5.40 per student per day. The funding is retroactive, meaning it would cover the time from the date schools closed due to the pandemic (March 19) through the end of the school year (May 22).

The pandemic has also changed the way food is distributed. Ensuring the safety of employees and the greater communities they serve has led some districts to go from five days a week to one or two.

Cartons of milk for each child in some cases are now gallons, so families don’t have to come back repeatedly and increase contact and exposure. Before the virus, districts may have ordered large tins of canned peaches or strawberries; now they’re distributed in single-serve cups, Clements said.

“It’s a very different process from having 800 kids come through a serving line where you’re constantly being backfilled from the kitchen,” Clements, the state nutrition director, said. “Even though the numbers may be smaller, it’s tough to feed say, 400 kids in a serving line when you’ve got to bag up everything individually, have everything ready, keep it hot or cold as the case may be, outside of the kitchen.”

In the Jackson Public School District, meals were served at 12 sites across the city on Mondays and Wednesdays during the school year. Initially the district was serving Monday through Friday, but department officials decided it was best to stick to two days for the safety of everyone involved.

“Of course maintaining safety is always a concern,” said Marc Rowe, school nutrition director at the district. “It’s always a challenge to make sure that we’re all practicing social distancing and wearing all of our protective equipment.”

JPS is using a drive-up method, where parents pull up to the sites and workers hand them the bagged meals — two on Mondays and three on Wednesdays, so families have food for the week but don’t have to come by daily.

The state’s second largest school district typically serves about 19,000 lunches and 10,000 breakfasts a day during the school year.

“We know that because of those numbers, there is a major need for students to eat breakfast and lunch even though they’re not in a traditional school setting,” Rowe said.

Since mid-March when the governor closed schools to mid-May, Rowe said the district served roughly 125,000 meals. The district returned to Monday through Friday service on June 1 until June 10 for its summer feeding program.

The Coahoma County School District, which serves almost 1,200 students, delivered 1,200 breakfast and 1,200 lunches every day on Monday through Friday. The district ended their delivery meal services two weeks ago to prepare for their summer feeding program on June 1.

Maintaining employee safety is a challenge for all districts, but for some, trying to reach as many students as possible has been the biggest barrier of all.

Wilma McIntosh, food service director in the Clarksdale Municipal School District, said the stigma of the virus and rural areas the district serves are making it difficult to reach as many students.

“Even though the advertisement is out there and we’re encouraging everyone to come, some still don’t come. They may not have transportation and some they just may be fearful with coming out,” McIntosh said.

Clarksdale Municipal schools, Coahoma’s neighboring district, served grab-and-go meals — including breakfast and lunch — for five days a week. Across three sites, over 500 students received meals daily, McIntosh said.

But, this doesn’t equate to nearly half of the 3,000 students in the district. The district usually serves 525,000 meals per year.

As a way to reach more kids, the district implemented “Wildcat on Wheels,” bussing meals to students across the town. This one-day operation ended quickly for fear of the “safety for the community and employees,” McIntosh said.

Unlike schools, the issue for the Olive Branch Food Pantry, comprising more than 20 churches and organizations, wasn’t transportation. Michele McCrory, director, said their initial issue was finding volunteers. Their usual volunteers consisted of older people. Despite social distancing measures, they felt unsafe being around others, she said. As a result, the pantry closed in April.

“It was a hard decision for us. Many pantries opened during the COVID-19 scare. We have a couple of board members who are older or take care of elderly people, so they couldn’t get around people,” McCrory said.

The pantry secured younger volunteers and reopened in May operating as a drive through. They serve about 60 boxes every week to families.

In addition to food pantries, nonprofits and community organizations helped carry the load by giving monetary relief and helping hands for meal distribution.

In Tallahatchie County, The Tutwiler Community Education Center stepped in when the local school district couldn’t provide meals. Before the coronavirus, the organization’s role has always been to support the community in times of need.

“When the storm hit (earlier this year) and people lights were out and lost food, we were able to get a donation to get 10,000 gift cards for food to support that need and fortunately, we were able to partner with organizations,” Melanie Powell, executive director of the center, said.

This time is no different except for the increasing demand of food, she said. They are now doling out more than 250 food boxes per week. At this rate, Powell says the center “will be a food bank.”

Through it’s FEED fund, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi received over $150,000 to provide meals and food boxes to food pantries, church and community organizations, and food pantries. The Maddox Foundation of Hernando and the Walton Family Foundation gave over $100,000 to assist the foundation in its efforts.

While the pandemic has undoubtedly hindered people’s ability to access basic sustenance, it doesn’t mean that it has inflamed an overwhelming sense of despair in all.

“I don’t want to keep portraying our community like we don’t still have people who have pride in this place just because of something like this,” Fountain said. “People are resilient. They find ways to bounce back. Even in this time of confusion, I encounter people who have smiles on their faces, who are happy about life. They’re grateful to be here, even in the midst of all this stuff that’s going on.”","‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemicJune 10, 2020When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

39,"Dec 4, 2019",The New York Times,Hundreds of Thousands Are Losing Access to Food Stamps,"Under the rule, effective April 1, 2020, an area eligible for a waiver would have to have a 24-month average unemployment rate that is not only 20 percent above the national average but also at least 6 percent.

Anti-poverty groups said the administration’s focus on the unemployment rate was misleading.

“The overall unemployment rate is really a measure of the whole labor market and not people without a high school diploma who are incredibly poor and may lack transportation,” said Stacy Dean, the vice president for food assistance policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We’re talking about a different group who just face a very different labor market.”

The rule is the first of three Agriculture Department efforts to scale back the food stamp program, and so far, Trump administration officials appear unmoved by the protests flooding in. More than 140,000 public comments were submitted on the rule that was made final on Wednesday, and they were overwhelmingly negative.

“The Trump administration is driving the vulnerable into hunger just as the Christmas season approaches,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday. “It is heartless. It is cruel. It exposes a deep and shameful cruelness and hypocrisy in this administration.”

The department has also proposed a rule that would close what it calls a loophole that allows people with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four — to receive food stamps. The rule would also prevent households with more than $2,250 in assets, or $3,500 for a household with a disabled adult, from receiving food stamps. Those changes would strip nearly three million people of their benefits, the department said, and nearly one million children would lose automatic eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals. The proposal received 75,000 public comments, which were overwhelmingly negative.","Under the rule, effective April 1, 2020, an area eligible for a waiver would have to have a 24-month average unemployment rate that is not only 20 percent above the national average but also at least 6 percent.
Anti-poverty groups said the administration’s focus on the unemployment rate was misleading.

41,"Jun 26, 2020",The Hechinger Report,Teen Health Mississippi tries to help youth survive during coronavirus,"When Teen Health Mississippi launched an emergency relief fund to assist young Mississippians ages 13 to 19 struggling to get enough to eat or find somewhere safe to stay during the pandemic, staff members predicted 500 applications, tops. They received more than 4,000.

Youth from each of Mississippi’s 82 counties applied for emergency aid from the nonprofit, which advocates for high-quality and evidence-based sex education and improved healthcare for teens in the state.

The pleas for help were often desperate. “I barely can eat, and I am tired of not having a stable place to live. I’m stressed,” wrote one applicant. “People are trying to pressure me into doing things I know are wrong, and that will only get me in trouble.”

Two-thirds of the roughly 4,000 teens who applied for emergency relief through the nonprofit Teen Health Mississippi said they were experiencing food insecurity.

Justin Lofton, director of Youth Engagement and Advocacy for the group, said a large percentage of applicants said their parents hadn’t yet received unemployment benefits after losing their jobs as a result of coronavirus closures, increasing the financial strain on their families. Almost two-thirds of youth said they were experiencing food insecurity. Others said they were homeless. Some could no longer afford medicine needed to treat diabetes, a health condition that can complicate recovery from the coronavirus.

Lofton said the crisis is particularly acute for LGBTQ youth in the state, who were more likely to experience hardships such as homelessness even before the pandemic. “We see a lot of young people, regardless of where they come from, are fending for themselves,” he said.

Teen Health Mississippi director, Hope Crenshaw, argues that empowering young people to look out for their best interests starts with addressing trauma and making sure their basic needs are met. She worries that now, many teens seeking help will be forced into difficult and even dangerous situations. “Youth aren’t able to make the most healthy decisions when they don’t have access to safe schools, clothing and shelter,” she said.

Through its emergency relief initiative, Teen Health Mississippi has disbursed nearly $11,000 in direct aid to more than 150 youth across the state. The amount allocated to each recipient has varied based on need.

About 4,000 teens, representing each of Mississippi’s 82 counties, applied for emergency relief from the nonprofit Teen Health Mississippi. The organization had anticipated just 500 would apply.

For Marchellos Scott, a rising high school senior in the Mississippi Delta, the assistance has been a lifeline. “Where I’m from, it’s very hard for us to get things that we need,” he said listing off reliable transportation and meals as challenges he and his peers often face.

Scott is a member of the Mississippi Youth Council, another advocacy effort supported by Teen Health Mississippi.* Initially he thought he’d spend the spring lobbying the state legislature for changes to the state’s sex-ed curriculum, before heading to a special college program for high school seniors in the summer. Then the pandemic arrived, threatening to derail his plans to participate in the program that could help him prepare for college.

The 17-year-old lives with a guardian and considered taking on a part-time job to help make ends meet. But he worried working would hamper his ability to earn college credits over the summer and get a jumpstart on his higher education.

Scott received a scholarship from the University of Mississippi to participate in a selective public policy program in which 40 upcoming high school seniors will have the opportunity to stay on campus and travel to the District of Columbia. (The program has since transitioned to distance learning.) The financial help from Teen Health Mississippi means Scott will be able to participate in the program after all.

The nonprofit has also partnered with several youth-focused organizations across the state to help cover costs for other assistance, including rent stipends and baby supplies for young or expectant parents. A $75,000 grant from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s #startsmall initiative is sponsoring the effort.

Those dollars are already being used to support youth tribal members of Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, one of the groups hardest hit by coronavirus in the state. Teen Health Mississippi has also partnered with a local group to help deliver groceries to families trying to limit their trips outside the home and to establish spending accounts for youth at local stores.

Crenshaw and Lofton know many young people are thankful for the assistance, but they that without bigger, more systemic changes kids won’t be able to weather the pandemic and the resulting economic crisis long term.

“It can’t be this piecemeal approach,” Crenshaw said.

42,"Dec 21, 2020",The Counter,Hunger and food insecurity are not the same. Here’s why that matters—and what they mean.,"For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

But that number actually represented the lowest rates of food insecurity in nearly a decade. The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic.

A snapshot assessment led by the U.S. Census Bureau and designed to offer less-comprehensive but more immediate information on the social and economic impacts of Covid, showed that, as recently as the period between November 25 and December 7 (including Thanksgiving), some 27 million adults—13 percent of all adults in the country—reported their household sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat.","For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

43,"Jan 11, 2021",The Conversation US,18 million US children are at risk of hunger: How is the problem being addressed and what more can be done?,"Editor’s note: The economic crisis brought about by the coronavirus pandemic has increased the number of Americans who can’t always get enough to eat, including children. The Conversation U.S. asked four experts to explain how common child hunger is and what’s being done to address it.

1. How big a problem is child hunger in the US?

Heather Eicher-Miller, associate professor of nutrition science at Purdue University: Hunger has two very different meanings. It can describe that uncomfortable feeling you get after not eating in a while. It’s also a long-term physical state.

People who experience long-term hunger aren’t just uncomfortable. They can feel weakness or pain and run an elevated risk of illnesses, including asthma, iron-deficiency anemia and poor bone health.

Hunger can of course arise when someone doesn’t eat enough, but it’s also a result of food insecurity – what happens when you lack the money or other means of accessing enough of the right kinds or amounts of food.

Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

David Himmelgreen, professor of anthropology at the University of South Florida: Food insecurity and child hunger have both skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were an estimated 50 million food-insecure Americans by the end of 2020, up sharply from 35 million in 2019, the last year for which official data is available.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, estimated in 2019 that there were 12.5 million U.S. children – 1 in 6 – at risk of hunger. With growth in the number of American workers unemployed and children living in poverty, a team of researchers determined in July 2020 that 18 million children – 1 in 4 – were experiencing food insecurity at least sometimes, a few months into the coronavirus pandemic.

Kecia Johnson, assistant professor of sociology at Mississippi State University: Children who experience hunger are more likely to be sick, to recuperate from illness more slowly and to be hospitalized more frequently.

Among other things, being food insecure increases the potential for obesity, heart disease and diabetes, including for children. And food-insecure children are at least twice as likely as other kids to have a variety of health problems, such as anemia, asthma and anxiety.

Food-insecure kids can also have more trouble at school than other children and become more likely to experience social isolation.

2. What’s being done about the problem?

Diana Cuy Castellanos, assistant professor of dietetics and nutrition at the University of Dayton: Some 15 federal programs assist Americans who need help getting enough nutritious food to eat. The programs cover different populations including the elderly, people with low incomes, infants and children, and Native American communities, as well as areas where there is need for emergency relief due to disasters.

The largest is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known more commonly as SNAP. It provides assistance for the purchase of food based on income and cost US$85.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Following the passage of a bipartisan relief package in December, most families of four can currently get $782 in monthly assistance through SNAP.

Many people still call these benefits “food stamps,” but now, instead of receiving vouchers to purchase food, people receive a card that looks like a credit card with their food allowance on it.

The government also runs the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides nutritional aid for low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women and women with at least one child age 5 or under. In addition, there are the School Breakfast and Lunch programs as well as the Summer Food Service Program, which funds free healthy meals and snacks to children and teens in low-income areas when school is not in session.

Many of these programs target specific segments of the population, such as children and the elderly. All have something in common: They are designed to help low-income families afford food so as to free up more of their limited income on other needs, such as housing and transportation.

Himmelgreen: While federal nutrition programs have helped reduce the severity of food insecurity and child hunger, only a limited number of Americans who don’t get enough to eat can take advantage of them. To get SNAP in Florida, for example, people may not have more than a total of either $2,001 or $3,001 – depending on their age and disabilities – in their savings and checking accounts. Other states have similar but different restrictions, making it hard to estimate the number of Americans who need help but can’t get it. Hence, millions more people than ever are relying on drive-through food pantries during the pandemic.

Johnson: There are some 60,000 food pantries, meal programs and food banks, according to Feeding America, serving about 40 million people yearly. Feeding America and its affiliated food banks and pantries also run food pantries in schools and backpack programs, which provide students with easily prepared foods, like boxed macaroni and cheese and canned beans, to take home, throughout the country.

For example, an elementary school in Holmes County, Mississippi, has supplied participating families with food and other supplies since 2019.

Eicher-Miller: Nutrition education is another way to address food insecurity and help reduce the number of children who go hungry. For example, the federal government offers nutrition education to individuals and families who receive SNAP benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education program, or SNAP-Ed. It provides comprehensive nutrition education regarding how to get the most nutrition per food dollar to many of the people who get SNAP benefits and may be having trouble serving their families healthy meals on a limited budget.

The government supports SNAP-Ed in locations like food pantries, community centers and food assistance offices. Its practical budgeting advice, cooking classes and nutrition information make families with children less likely to experience food insecurity, according to a study by my team. When people get the hang of buying the healthiest foods they can on a tight budget, their kids are less likely to go hungry.

I think of nutrition education as a gift that keeps giving in the sense that once someone has the knowledge they can keep using it to stay food secure into the future.

3. What are some of the more promising innovations?

Cuy Castellanos: Food insecurity is a complex problem for many reasons, including the limited access millions of people have to the fresh fruits and vegetables everyone should eat.

That’s why I’m excited to see people starting to grow their own food in low-income communities with few grocery stores or opportunities to buy produce, from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Nonprofits and families are growing food on their own property or are using vacant lots or land on school or church grounds.

Some groups such as Homefull and Mission of Mary Farms in Dayton, Ohio, have even begun to build greenhouses to extend the growing season and producing root vegetables and leafy greens as well as raising chickens.

Johnson: A new community garden is also making a difference in the small majority-Black town of Maben in rural Mississippi, where there’s nowhere to buy vegetables. Starting in 2019, local leaders approved the conversion of a former school athletic field into a community garden. Once volunteers from a farmers cooperative had cleared and plowed the field, other volunteers planted and harvested crops of tomatoes, purple hull peas, okra and watermelons. The gardeners distributed this first wave of produce primarily to elderly people in Maben who used to have family gardens and give away their own homegrown food in years past.

Himmelgreen: Many innovative programs across the country are aiming to reduce food insecurity and improve the health of low-income Americans.

At “client food choice” food pantries, clients don’t just pick up boxes of free, nutritious items. Instead, they get to choose the foods they want and get recipes and other kinds of nutrition education. There are also food prescription programs based in hospitals and medical clinics, where patients are screened for food insecurity and, if eligible, enrolled in SNAP and given help connecting with food pantries either on site or nearby.

A growing number of nonprofits also refer people to school-based food pantries, which operate in K-12 public schools and on college campuses and the meals-on-wheels programs that assist people who are homebound.

I believe these programs need to be scaled up or replicated whenever possible in areas where there is a high level of food insecurity and child hunger but a lack of nonprofit help available.","Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

“I know not everybody can donate a million dollars, but I feel like this is the central place to [donate to] if you really want to do something,” Winfrey says during their virtual interview. “I know I can trust my money in your hands.”

A stunned Andrés — who could barely believe he was speaking with Winfrey! — immediately expressed his gratitude. “We are so honored to be in your presence giving this fund this kind of visibility,” he says. “We are going to come out of this crisis stronger than ever, making sure we don’t leave anybody behind.”

America’s Food Fund was launched with $12 million on Thursday by Leonardo DiCaprio, Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple to aid World Central Kitchen and Feeding America.

According to a press release, “America’s Food Fund will address the issue of food access in the United States and will provide funding relief to both organizations in furthering their missions to feed the country’s most vulnerable populations impacted by COVID-19, including children who rely on school lunch programs, low-income families, the elderly, and individuals facing job disruptions.”

Andrés was one of the first to launch relief efforts amid the coronavirus outbreak, when he began serving food to thousands of passengers and crew members on board the quarantined Grand Princess cruise ship in early March. World Central Kitchen supported nearly 2,500 passengers and over 1,000 crew members who spent several days stuck on the ship.

45,"Sep 9, 2020",Wiley,Measuring Food Insecurity during the COVID‐19 Pandemic of Spring 2020,"This projected rise in food insecurity was based on historical relationships between the unemployment rates and official federal government numbers on food insecurity (for detailed information on measuring food insecurity and its relationship with economic conditions see Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011 and Gundersen and Ziliak 2018 ). Would this relationship hold during the pandemic? Or would the state and governmental measures to mitigate the damages of the pandemic, accompanied by greater efforts in the food charity system, keep food insecurity in check? To answer this question, we conducted an internet survey on May 13–14, 2020 measuring food security following the methods in Ahn, Smith, and Norwood ( 2020 ). It is referred to as the ASN survey.

As employees were furloughed or laid off, businesses saw their sales plummet in the spring of 2020 due to COVID‐19, and some food prices rose, it was evident that many people would be in financial straits. Concerns arose that an unprecedented number of Americans would have trouble obtaining their food needs. On April 19, 2020 a representative of Feeding America remarked that requests for food assistance at food pantries were expected to rise by almost 50% and that they had spent more money on food in the past month than the previous six months combined (CBS 2020 ). The unemployment rate for April 2020 was 14.7%, up from 4.4% in the previous month (USBLS 2020 ), and Feeding America (with help from agricultural economists) projected on April 22 that such a rise in unemployment should be associated with a 5% increase in the food insecurity rate (Feeding America 2020 ).

The ASN Survey in May 13–14, 2020

The ASN survey entails using a nonrepresentative opt‐in sample where individuals are administered the food security questionnaire used by the USDA in its official food security estimates. While the USDA survey represents the gold standard in food security estimates due to its use of expensive probability sampling, it is only administered once a year, in December. If rapid, timely food security estimates are desired then less representative samples like the ASN survey is required. Internet surveys using opt‐in panels are not the ideal method for measuring the impact of COVID‐19 on food insecurity. They may appear representative in terms of a few demographics but because they are not true probability samples, they are unrepresentative in terms of other demographics. Our previous research has shown these samples can differ greatly from the US population in terms of variables like unemployment, for example.

Even when careful sample balancing is used and procedures are set in place to mimic the screening procedures employed by the USDA (where some households are automatically deemed to be food secure and are not administered the food security questionnaire), food insecurity rates can be 9%–14% higher than those estimated by the USDA. However, our research also demonstrates that results from internet surveys can be calibrated to mimic closely the USDA statistics. By using a more stringent screening process than that used by the USDA one can obtain insecurity numbers that closely resemble the USDA numbers for 2016 and 2017. The two years of prior experience with the ASN survey, however, suggests that it will still overpredict the percentage of food insecure households by 2%–3% (Ahn, Smith, and Norwood 2020).

Our survey differs from the ASN survey given in 2016 and 2017 in only one regard: how household income is elicited. The household income question typically asks respondents' total household pretax income, but during COVID‐19, many households may feel they are unsure exactly what their income will be. As such, we ask two income questions. The first asks their actual income in 2019 and the second asks their expected income for 2020. An additional question also asks if the size of their household has changed between 2019 and 2020 to help isolate income changes caused by changes in household composition.

The sample was acquired from the Qualtrics company, who selected a sample of respondents from its opt‐in panel that is similar to the demographic profile of the US in terms of age, income, gender, education, and race. These individuals are recruited using a variety of methods, including internet recruitment and referrals. Compensation for taking surveys is performed through airline miles, cash, gift cards, and the like, and third‐party validation is used to confirm the participants' contact information. The survey was administered on the Qualtrics software platform during the period May 13–14, 2020.

Each household was administered ten to eighteen questions (depending on whether they have children) to evaluate their food security status. This is the identical questionnaire used by the USDA in its official food insecurity estimates (ERS 2012). We follow the same protocol as Ahn, Smith, and Norwood (2020) for translating the ten to eighteen responses for each household into to one of four food security status groups: high food security, marginal food security, low food security, and very low food security. A household is then considered food insecure if the status is low or very low. Details on the questions and this protocol are discussed fully in Ahn, Smith, and Norwood (2020).

The USDA survey employees a protocol by which households are given a preliminary food security question, and if they indicate no food insecurity in this question and indicate a household income above 185% of the poverty line then they are assumed to be food secure and are not administered the food security questionnaire. This is referred to as “screening” and is done to limit respondent fatigue, as the USDA contains many questions in addition to food security (it is conducted in addition to the Current Population Survey), but since our internet survey contains far fewer questions we ask both the preliminary question and the food security questions of all respondents. Our previous research showed that if you employ sample balancing to reconcile demographic differences between the sample and the population, and if the screening procedure is simulated the internet survey will overestimate food insecurity by 9–14%. However, if the screening procedure is replaced with a calibration that simply assumes all households above 185% of the poverty line are food secure, the internet survey closely mimics the USDA numbers, so that is the procedure we employ. This survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oklahoma State University: application number IRB‐20‐245.

We previously administered the identical food security questionnaires in 2016 and 2017, allowing us to compare May 2020 rates to those in recent years where economic conditions were more normal. Table 1 shows the demographic profile of the respondents in the May 2020 survey compared to our similar surveys in December of 2016 and 2017 (Ahn, Smith, and Norwood 2020). A number of demographics are consistent across surveys, like income and gender. Other demographics have some variations, like household size, region, and education. Demographics like the percentage of households with an unemployed member can differ considerably. While sample balancing can be used to correct for these demographic differences, it is an imperfect correction. A main difference is that unemployment is not a variable used in sample balancing for May 2020 because as of May the percent of households with an unemployed member was unknown.

The respondents reported being affected by COVID‐19. One survey question asked how their financial status had changed since March 2020 due to the pandemic. Four responses were available (no change in household income, lost job, lower household income, higher household income) and respondents could select multiple options. While 50% reported no change in their financial status, 19% indicated that one or more household members lost their job and 33% said their household would make less money. When comparing households' expected 2020 income to their 2019 income, on average households expect to make about $3,000 less this year than the previous year. Also, when asked whether any household member experienced symptoms resembling Covid‐19, 11% said “yes”, 2% said “maybe,” and 87% said “no.” Of those who said “yes” or “maybe,” 37% were not tested, 42% tested positive, and 21% tested negative.","This projected rise in food insecurity was based on historical relationships between the unemployment rates and official federal government numbers on food insecurity (for detailed information on measuring food insecurity and its relationship with economic conditions see Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011 and Gundersen and Ziliak 2018 ).

47,1 month ago,PRNewswire,"Surety One, Inc. and CEO Challenge Hunger in Mississippi","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Feb. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- According to national statistics collected in January of the present year, twenty-nine million families have reported that they have not had enough food to eat within the last seven days (Household Pulse Survey). The figure represents almost five times the reported food instability percentage reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture prior to the pandemic. Adults in households with children were many times more likely to report lack of sufficient food. Per population, Mississippi is the most affected state in the United States. With the exception of the District of Columbia, Mississippi suffers the highest rate of nourishment insecure children...by far.

""In the richest country in the world, it's disgraceful that any child goes hungry."", Constantin Poinexter, CEO

On the 26th of January, Surety One, Inc. delivered a monetary gift to the Mississippi Food Network to combat hunger and food insecurity affecting Mississippi families. Pursuant to Surety One, Inc.'s agreement with the Poindexter Surety charitable alliance, chief executive officer Constantin Poindexter doubled the corporate donation with his personal funds. In effort to draw attention to the current suffering of local families, Poindexter contacted the chief executives of Mississippi's ten largest privately held businesses and urged them to consider doing the same.

Said Poindexter, ""It's unbelievable that in the most prosperous nation in the world that we have hungry kids. Nearly 75% of Mississippi children are eligible for free or reduced cost lunches which many can't obtain as a result of COVID-related school closures. Other than terminal illnesses it's hard to imagine many things more heartbreaking that kids going to bed hungry. It really is disgraceful. This food insecurity thing is going to be a pet project of our charitable work going forward.""

Operating since 1984, the Mississippi Food Network distributes over 1.5. million pounds of food per month. It is one of the most efficient charitable delivery vehicles of its kind, boasting a delivery of ninety-five cents of each dollar donated, to food programs.

As a member of the communities that it serves, Surety One, Inc. contributes to the relief of the sick, disabled, and less fortunate members of society. Surety One, Inc. is a supporter of the No Kid Hungry Foundation and the Feeding America initiative, and urges everyone to consider a donation to the cause of defeating food insecurity.

Under deals with contractors, universities have hiked meal plan prices significantly in recent years, adding to rising cost of college.

Editor's note: The Southern Foodways Alliance has collaborated with the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger, AL.com and Mississippi Today to shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi.

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food.Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an ""unlimited"" meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal ""swipes"" didn't roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).""

Glasper isn't alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country, and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor, Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

""Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,"" said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

Story continues below gallery.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State's operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

RELATED: Real food challenge: Auburn University, unlike peers, requires 20% local source of dining food

But contractors eventually ran out of ""ways to distinguish themselves on the service side"" when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

""Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it,"" he said.

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12 percent commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn't reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a ""campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan ""is much, much more expensive"" than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won't use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,"" Mac Dermott said of meal options. ""They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a ""food-court environment"" where managers can ""interchange menu concepts very easily,"" said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.""

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into a “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

""Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,"" said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. ""They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they're going to have access to (at home).""

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but ""we've adjusted"" to student demand. ""Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there's going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the ""Ultimate"" plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren't using the rising prices to ""pad the pocket of the institution."" She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshmen are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 ""Rebel Unlimited Plus 1"" plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract ""to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,"" said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar ""Dining Dollars"" food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama's contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid such as Pell Grants doesn't always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better about using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,"" Grant said. ""But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefits package, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there,"" he said. Eventually, it was ""ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.”

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,"" Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017.

""I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,"" he said. ""We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

50,"Jun 3, 2020",PRNewswire,Study Shows State And Local Food Insecurity Reached Lowest Levels Since Its Inception 10 Years Ago,"CHICAGO, June 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- After nearly ten years, food insecurity levels for most communities across the country had reached their lowest levels in 2018, according to a study released by Feeding America. Map the Meal Gap, released today by Feeding America, is the only study that provides local-level estimates of food insecurity across the United States. Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization, has released the report for ten consecutive years to offer insights on how food insecurity and food costs vary at the local level.

In conjunction with the Map the Meal Gap study, which uses the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Census Bureau, Feeding America has released an interactive map based on its recently released study, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, which used the Map the Meal Gap model to predict changes to food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to projected changes to poverty and unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus (COVD-19) pandemic. That analysis shows that progress made to food insecurity in the U.S. this past decade will likely be wiped out and food insecurity rates will climb higher than the peak of the Great Recession of 50 million people, potentially going from more than 37 million people facing hunger in 2018 up to more than 54 million in 2020.

""Map the Meal Gap shows once again that not one single county in this country is free from hunger,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, chief executive officer of Feeding America. ""In the decade before the pandemic, we made progress in finally returning to pre-Great Recession levels of food insecurity, though that number was still regrettably high. That fragile progress has given way under the weight of this crisis. The Feeding America network of food banks knows all too well the precarious nature of household budgets. We also know that the work that we do has great potential to help and we cannot make meaningful progress alone. Our vision is an America where no one is hungry. Join us in making that mission a reality for the tens of millions of people out there who need us now more than ever.""

Per Map the Meal Gap 2020, all 3,142 counties and county equivalents as well as 436 congressional districts in all 50 states are home to people who struggle with hunger. The percentage of the population estimated to be food insecure in 2018 ranges from a low of 3.6% of the population in Burke County, North Dakota up to 30.4% in Jefferson County, Mississippi. Child food insecurity rates range from 2.4% in Falls Church City, Virginia to 43.7% in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana.

According to the COVID-19 impact analysis, the food insecurity rates for all counties across the country will likely see increases. For example, Jefferson County, Mississippi, the county with the highest overall food insecurity rate is projected to increase from 30.4% to 34.2% this year. Burke County, North Dakota, which had the lowest overall food insecurity rate in 2018, is projected to see a food insecurity rate (9.2%) more than 2.5 times its most recent rate (3.6%). In East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, more than half the child population is projected to be food insecure, with the rate going from 43.7% to 52.5% because of the pandemic.

While food insecurity affects every community, people of color and African Americans, in particular, are disproportionately impacted as a result of structural disparities. In 2018, food insecurity among African American households was more than twice that of white, non-Hispanic households according to the USDA. Structural and institutional racism have positioned communities of color as particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout and health consequences of this pandemic. Systemic barriers to jobs less likely to be affected by the pandemic, lower than average wages, and greater employment instability all contribute to African American workers being more at risk of experiencing food insecurity. Both pre-pandemic and in 2020, counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are overrepresented by counties with a majority African American population. For example, in Jefferson County, Mississippi, which has the highest food insecurity rate in 2018 and highest projected rate in 2020, 86% of the population is African American.

These Feeding America studies underscore the extent of need that remains in communities across the United States. Food insecurity is a measure defined by the USDA as lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members.

Other key findings of Map the Meal Gap 2020 include:

One-third of people who are food insecure may not qualify for federal food assistance. Virtually every county (97%) is home to people who are food insecure and likely ineligible for such assistance, and there are 115 counties in which a majority of people estimated to be food insecure is unlikely to qualify.

Counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are disproportionately rural. Rural counties – those outside of major metropolitan areas – make up 63% of all U.S counties, but 87% of counties with food insecurity rates in the top 10%.

An estimated 84% of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity – those that rank in the top 10% of all 3,142 counties – are in the South. Since the South contains 45% of all U.S. counties, this region is home to a disproportionately high number of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity.

""Hunger in America must become unacceptable for all of us,"" Babineaux-Fontenot continued. ""There were 37 million people facing hunger before the pandemic, but most people had no idea. If there is any 'silver lining' to the dark cloud of this pandemic, it is that the American public is far better informed about the food crisis that has accompanied the health one. We know it will take an entire network of support, including food banks, partner agencies like food pantries, federal nutrition programs, the food industry, and the public to make the progress that is so desperately needed.""

Map the Meal Gap 2020 uses data from USDA, the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and food price data and analysis provided by Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company. The study is supported by Conagra Brands Foundation and Nielsen.

""Conagra Brands Foundation is proud to partner with Feeding America and food banks across the country to help provide food to children, teenagers, adults and senior citizens. Helping to increase awareness of this critical issue, which affects every community in America, has never been more important,"" said Robert J. Rizzo, Senior Director, Community Investment, Conagra Brands and Conagra Brands Foundation.

In addition to food-insecurity estimates, Map the Meal Gap reports on food price variation across counties. Using data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS), the study finds that, on average, food-secure individuals report spending $3.09 per person, per meal as of 2018. This is essentially the same as the national average of $3.02 ($3.09 in 2018 dollars) as reported in Map the Meal Gap last year.

After adjusting the national average meal cost of $3.09 based on local sales taxes and Nielsen data on relative food prices, Map the Meal Gap 2020 finds that county meal costs range from 69% of the national average in places like Llano County, Texas ($2.14) to more than double the average cost in places like New York County, New York ($6.19).

""Nielsen is proud to continue our decade long data and analytics partnership to Map the Meal Gap. Eliminating hunger is especially urgent with so many vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said David Rawlinson, CEO, Nielsen Global Connect.

Dr. Craig Gundersen, Professor of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois, Executive Director of the National Soybean Research Laboratory and a member of Feeding America's Technical Advisory Group is the lead researcher of Map the Meal Gap 2020 and the food insecurity projection analysis.

Map the Meal Gap 2020 provides the following data online through an interactive map:

The estimated percentage of the population and number of individuals who are food insecure in every U.S. state, county and congressional district, as well as the service area of each Feeding America food bank.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely qualifies for SNAP and other federal nutrition programs.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely does not qualify for federal nutrition programs and thus must rely even more on charitable food assistance. These percentages reflect individuals in households with earnings that are higher than the state gross income limits for federal nutrition programs.

The average meal cost in every state and county.

The food budget shortfall in every state and county.

The Map the Meal Gap 2020 map allows policymakers, state agencies, corporate partners, food banks and advocates to develop integrated strategies to fight hunger on a community level.

Separately, a new interactive map shows the 2020 food insecurity projections compared to the most recent Map the Meal Gap data. To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national annual unemployment projection due to COVID-19 using projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation from Goldman Sachs Investment Research and actual percentages of workers by industry from the American Community Survey.

Along with the interactive map and visualizations, Feeding America has also published a series of report briefs, including a summary of key findings as well as analyses on child food insecurity, food price variation and health, disability and food insecurity.

Federal nutrition assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), serve as the first line of defense against hunger. However, not everyone who is food insecure qualifies for these federal programs. As of 2018, one in three (32%) food-insecure individuals who reported income lived in households unlikely to qualify for most federal food assistance. These findings underscore the importance of protecting and strengthening the existing safety net of public food assistance while also investing in the charitable programs that help to fill the gap for people who are not eligible.

Giving my children something to eat in the morning has become difficult,” said Kadidia Diallo, a female milk producer in Burkina Faso. “We are totally dependent on the sale of milk, and with the closure of the market we can’t sell the milk anymore. If we don’t sell milk, we don't eat.”

‘ The Hunger Virus ,’ warns that 121 million more people could be pushed to the brink of starvation this year as a result of the social and economic fallout from the pandemic, including through mass unemployment, disruption to food production and supplies, and declining aid.

A new Oxfam briefing warns that as many as 12,000 people could die per day by the end of the year as a result of hunger linked to COVID-19, potentially more than could die from the disease.

“COVID-19 is the last straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict, climate change, inequality and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers,” said Oxfam America President Abby Maxman.

In Brazil, for instance, millions of poor workers, with little in the way of savings or benefits to fall back on, lost their incomes as a result of lockdown. Only 10 percent of the financial support promised by the federal government had been distributed by late June with big business favored over workers and smaller more vulnerable companies.

In India, travel restrictions left farmers without vital migrant labor at the peak of the harvest season, forcing many to leave their crops in the field to rot. Traders have also been unable to reach tribal communities during the peak harvest season for forest products, depriving up to 100 million people of their main source of income for the year.

The United States is not immune to this hunger crisis. The pandemic obliterated systems that had, for years, kept millions one small step away from poverty and food insecurity. Countless businesses shuttered, leaving millions unemployed and struggling to pay bills. Schools closed, removing reliable sources of breakfast and lunch for millions of students. The food chain faltered—from produce fields to meat plants--causing prices to rise. It’s estimated that food insecurity rates in the United States have doubled.

“The awful truth is that food insecurity is exploding here in our own backyard,” said Maxman. “Every town has people who are going to bed hungry right now. Those who were on the edge before are now struggling to stay afloat. In Mississippi, nearly a quarter of all residents are experiencing food insecurity; in Louisiana, over a third of all children are facing empty cupboards.”

In every region in the world, women, and women-headed households, are more likely to go hungry. Women are already vulnerable because of systemic discrimination that sees them earn less and own fewer assets than men. They make up a large proportion of groups, such as informal workers, that have been hit hard by the economic fallout of the pandemic, and have also borne the brunt of a dramatic increase in unpaid care work as a result of school closures and family illness.

“Governments can save lives now by fully funding the UN’s COVID-19 appeal, making sure aid gets to those who need it most, and cancelling the debts of developing countries to free up funding for social protection and healthcare. To end this hunger crisis, governments must also build fairer, more robust, and more sustainable food systems, that put the interests of food producers and workers before the profits of big food and agribusiness,” said Eric Muñoz, Senior Manager Food and Climate Justice, Oxfam America.

Since the pandemic began, Oxfam has reached 4.5 million of the world’s most vulnerable people with food aid and clean water, working together with over 344 partners in over 60 countries. We aim to reach a total of 14 million people by raising a further $113 million to support our programs.

In the United States, Oxfam is advocating for the government to take steps to help the most vulnerable make ends meet during the pandemic. Right now, the US Senate has an opportunity to fight this hunger crisis at home and globally. Please join us in asking your Senator to ensure urgent funding to support people facing hunger in the US and around the world is included in the next #COVID19 relief bill.","“We are totally dependent on the sale of milk, and with the closure of the market we can’t sell the milk anymore.

53,"Nov 30, 2018",Ole Miss News,Office of Food and Nutrition Security Opens at South Oxford Center,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The School of Applied Sciences at the University of Mississippi has opened a new Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the South Oxford Center.

Although David H. Holben, professor of nutrition and hospitality management, has been producing food security research at UM since he arrived in 2015, he and his students finally have devoted space to analyze data, conduct focus groups and interviews, and engage with community members.

“My vision for the Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the University of Mississippi is to be the recognized leader in providing innovative solutions for food insecurity in Mississippi, the United States and the world,” said Holben, who has been studying the problem since 1997.

“I’m hoping that we can have a global impact. I think (establishing a formal office) just reinforces the support that the university and the school have for this issue of food insecurity.”

Food insecurity is a lack of regular access to enough food to maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. According to the USDA’s 2017 estimates, some 15 million American households were food insecure.

More than 13 percent of rural households reported food insecurity, much higher than those in metropolitan areas. Between 2015 and 2017, food insecurity in Mississippi was among the highest in the nation, at 17.2 percent.

The university community is committed to helping solve this problem through its Flagship Constellations initiative, which seeks to find meaningful solutions through multidisciplinary response to health and social issues affecting Mississippi communities, the nation and the world. One of those constellations is Community Wellbeing, which works to find solutions to the challenges affecting rural communities to build stronger and more vibrant communities.

Holben brings food security expertise and research from the Office of Food and Nutrition Security to this collaboration.

Students and staff conducting research through the Office of Food and Nutrition Security have presented their findings at international conferences, including discussions of seven studies at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ annual conference in October.

Doctoral student Prabhdeep Sandha, of Jalandhar City, India, earned the Mead Johnson Nutrition/Research Dietetic Practice Group Student Research Award at the conference for her study, “Impact of a Produce Intervention on Parental Produce Intake and Behaviors,” co-authored by fellow graduate student Michelle Weber, of Cincinnati.

“Our (office) is continuously working to make a difference in Mississippi through fresh produce and healthy food interventions, community engagement and community education,” Sandha said. “With our previous projects, we were able to see some great results, which I hope will be evident in our future projects.”

Undergraduate students also are gaining research skills through the new office. Katelyn Tarr, a junior dietetics and nutrition major from Pawnee, Illinois, presented a study on “Food insecurity and type 2 diabetes risk of adults with school children” at the conference, with funding from the first Undergraduate Travel Grant awarded by the UM Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.

“Dr. Holben brought me in to learn how to write an abstract and make a poster for a conference, which is something that graduate students would normally do,” Tarr said. “It really helped me prepare for my post-graduate career.

“I was excited to work on nutrition research, but it turns out this really hits close to home for me. I’m from an area that has high food insecurity, so it was awesome to be a part of that.”

Five of the abstracts presented at conference stem from the Farm-to-YOUth! Project that Holben and his students have been working on since 2016, studying varying nutritional and educational interventions and their impact on food security in a rural Mississippi county.

From produce tastings and take-home produce for elementary school children to summer nutrition education and feeding programs at the public library, the faculty-student team has examined different ways to improve food security for people living in rural areas.

This fall, the office rolled out a new study in Calhoun County to examine food education interventions for high school athletes.

Holben, along with an external consultant, develops the twice-weekly programming that includes a lesson, snack and educational handouts. Graduate students Marta Dees, of Oxford, and Rebecca Henry, of The Plains, Virginia, teach the lessons and give each football player a take-home bag of fuel for the week, including peanut butter, yogurt, fresh fruit and granola bars, to implement the practices at home.

“We’re primarily hoping to change the food environment at home,” Holben said. “They’re learning eight to 10 basic principles about food and nutrition that we’re helping them to implement through take-home food packages.

“I think we can play a really key role in teaching basic sport nutrition principles to high schoolers, while keeping performance nutrition at the forefront of the coach’s mind. The hope is we can fill in the gap if they do have food insecurity in the home to help them to implement some performance nutrition principles since they’re athletes.”

Holben, lead author of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ most recent position paper on food insecurity in the United States, is elated with the opportunities that come with having an official office at the South Oxford Center. He looks forward to playing a significant role in fulfilling the university’s commitment to creating healthier, more vibrant communities.

54,"Mar 12, 2020",Civil Eats,Congress Addresses Food Insecurity in Its Legislative Response to COVID-19,"Editor’s note: This is a developing story; Civil Eats will update as the news evolves.

March 27, 2020 update: The U.S. House of Representative overwhelmingly passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus recovery and stimulus bill today, sending it to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it.

March 26, 2020 update: The Senate’s stimulus bill includes nearly $16 billion for SNAP, but not the additional 15 percent boost that Democrats were seeking. Also included in the bill is a $9.5 billion emergency fund for producers of specialty crops and support for local food systems, including farmers’ markets. In addition, the bill directs $285 million to USDA agencies to support emergency operations during the pandemic.

March 25, 2020 update: The Senate and White House early on Wednesday reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion spending bill aimed at supporting businesses, workers, and individuals during the pandemic. The bill text is not yet public, but once it is made public, the House of Representatives will review and vote on the bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats earlier this week offered their own version of a stimulus / support package.

March 18, 2020 update: The Senate on Wednesday afternoon voted 90-8 to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, aimed at providing some support and benefits to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

March 16, 2020 update: Early on Saturday, March 14, the House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with strong bipartisan support, and with many of the provisions described in the original article below included.

The final text includes language that gives USDA the ability to waive various requirements that are preventing districts from feeding hungry children while schools are shuttered. As of March 15, at least 64,000 schools have closed, affecting more than 32.5 million students.

On SNAP, the final bill prevents eligibility restrictions during a public health emergency and gives states some flexibility to ask for emergency allotments, but does not directly increase benefits. It also provides an additional $500 million in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and an additional $250 million for food programs for low-income seniors, through September 2021.

The Senate is expected to take up the bill today. While some Republicans and President Trump have signaled support, its fate is still uncertain.

March 13, 2020, 3pm ET update:In a press conference at 2:00pm ET, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be “passing a bill” today. “Our bill takes aggressive action to strengthen food security initiatives including student meals as well as SNAP, senior meals, and food banks,” she said. However, Civil Eats has yet to see a final version of the legislative package, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. So it remains unclear which of the provisions on school meals and SNAP benefits (described below, as provisions of separate marker bills) will make it into the final legislation.

March 13, 2020, 11am ET update: As of early Friday, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate the package of legislation; a vote in the House of Representatives is expected today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned for the weekend on Thursday, but canceled the Senate’s scheduled recess next week, so a vote on the legislative package could happen next week if the House passes the bill.

At least 10,600 schools have closed across the U.S., affecting at least 4.9 million students. Five states have closed their schools entirely: Ohio, Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and Washington.

55,"Oct 5, 2020",WJTV,Organizations to distribute more food boxes in October,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Leaders with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith joined representatives from the Mississippi Food Network (MFN) on Monday. They discussed the Farmers to Families Food Box program.

So far, more than 705,000 food boxes have been distributed in Mississippi. The program is a USDA-led effort designed to assist families, farmers and food distributors who have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thanks to a partnership between the USDA and MFN, more boxes will be delivered in October. Greg Ibach, USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, said food insecurity has been an issue for a long time.

“Hunger is a problem across America, even in good times, and it’s a tough problem to try and address because it has so many different causes and reasons. But when people lose their jobs unexpectedly and immediately and in large numbers, it puts stress on our foodbank system,” Ibach stated.

The food boxes used to be broken up between fruits, meat and dairy. Now, the boxes will be a combination of the three to give people more of a balanced box.

57,"Apr 5, 2019",Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s Extra Table gets to tell its story to national audience as featured charity at D.C. gala,"It all started with a phone call and a plea from a Hattiesburg mission pantry. They’d exhausted their food inventory and needed help. Ringing chef/restaurateur Robert St. John was the right call.

Edwards Street Fellowship Center’s plea became the start of Extra Table, founded by St. John when he tapped decades of restaurant industry experience for a solution. The fastest and easiest way to get the food where it was needed: Call his Sysco rep, place an order and have the truck drop-ship it at the agency.

Once he realized the extent of food insecurity in the state, Extra Table reached out, expanding by as much as 50 percent annually early on. Now marking its 10th anniversary year, Extra Table tackles hunger and delivers to 39 local food pantries and soup kitchens from north Mississippi to the Gulf Coast, east to west, with nutritious, fresh food on a regular basis.

In addition to that milestone, Extra Table is the featured charity of Taste of the South (TOTS). The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded by Southern transplants shares flavors of their region while supporting home state causes. Representing 13 Southern states, TOTS annually raises more than half a million dollars for charities throughout the South (and one D.C.-based charity). Its annual black-tie gala (April 6 at the Washington Hilton this year) draws 2,300 guests and typically sells out.

“I’m so honored — and grateful,” St. John says. “As someone who has served Southern food to restaurant customers for over 31 years, I’m happy to be feeding healthy food to our neighbors most in need. The organizers of this event will be happy to know that 100 percent of their donations will go to purchase healthy food for mission pantries and soup kitchens throughout Mississippi.”

Extra Table had been on TOTS’ radar for a number of years. With 2019’s theme of Community Resilience, “Extra Table was on our short list” of possible selections, says Alex Monié, on TOTS’ Mississippi committee. Fundraising, with the 13 states working together, has topped $600,000 in recent years, he says, with most coming from home state support.

“Every state will receive a piece of the pie. Extra Table — because Mississippi is the featured state and they’re the featured charity and we worked hard to make sure we hit our fundraising goals — will receive a pretty significant piece of the pie. … Those numbers, unfortunately aren’t fully baked until after the gala, once all the checks come in. But we hope for it to be over $200,000.”

The recognition also brings a chance to tell Extra Table’s story on a national level, says Extra Table executive director Martha Allen. “To our knowledge, the way that we are set up to feed people isn’t done anywhere else. It’s such an easy template that can be dropped down on top of any state, no matter who the food distributor is, no matter what the demographics look like.”

Its ability to purchase healthy food in volume for consistent delivery, is a key driver, she says. “That food is delivered the last Wednesday of every month. Our pantries know what’s coming and when they’re going to get it, so they can have the confidence they’re going to have the ability to feed the people that they serve. … It’s just the most efficient and effective way to get food into the bellies of people that need it.”

Extra Table’s founding principles are that 100 percent of the money raised goes to food and that it will always be healthy, to help combat other Mississippi woes of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Planning is thoughtful, too, with tear-top tuna packages and pop-top cans, so recipients can access food even if they don’t have a can opener. Breakfast foods and healthy snacks are boosted in the summer, when kids don’t have access to school meals.

Partnerships are vital in the success, Allen says, such as with Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi, the newly formed College and University Anti-Hunger Alliance, Mississippi Center for Justice and all Extra Table’s feeding agency partners. “It wouldn’t work if we didn’t have partners, boots on the ground, all over the state, accepting our food and passing it out. … This is our specialty and that’s their specialty and it works beautifully together.”

“It’s partnerships like Extra Table that have paved the way for successful corporate responsibility programs to have guidance and success,” says Sysco marketing manager Katherine Capocelli. Sysco’s Nourishing Neighbors program provides local dollars to assist in food insecurity and more. “We know the commitment to end hunger is a mutual mission with partners like Extra Table.”

Extra Table’s 10th anniversary year brings other recognition, too. Extra Table is the WellsFest charity this year (with a fundraising goal of at least $50,000), and it’s also Lazy Magnolia Brewery’s charity for 2019.

“The thing that’s so important to us, that we value so much about Extra Table, is that it’s not just food but it’s nutritious food,’ says Ann McCullen, executive director at Edwards Street Fellowship Center, which distributed 230 tons of food in 2018. It serves an average of 1,500 households each month — more than 4,500 individuals — in a seven-county area in the Pine Belt region.

“Being in Mississippi, the majority of the people we serve have the chronic conditions of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes,” McCullen says. “So, when we hand them a can of food that’s packed with preservatives and sodium and sugars … it’s not ideal by any means. We would much rather give them healthy food, and that’s something that Robert has been committed to since the beginning, with Extra Table — that it be as nutritious as possible.”","Edwards Street Fellowship Center’s plea became the start of Extra Table, founded by St. John when he tapped decades of restaurant industry experience for a solution.

58,"Sep 11, 2020",PBS NewsHour,1 in 10 Americans don’t have enough food. The pandemic is making things worse,"Tens of millions of Americans were already wrestling with having enough food to eat before the coronavirus came along. Enter a pandemic that launched an historic recession and experts say that need has only grown.

For three years, Jennifer Lawrence has volunteered at the food bank at St. Luke Methodist Church in Tupelo, Mississippi. People who come to her are scared, not only about having enough food but also how they’re going to make it from one day to the next in the middle of COVID-19, she said. One woman in her 70s is now raising her grandchildren after her own child died, Lawrence said.

“Some of them are at their wit’s end,” she said, adding that her clients tell her, “‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”

“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.'”

Data is starting to catch up to the real-life fallout of dueling health and economic crises, and shows that households of color and those with less income are disproportionately affected so far. In late August, about one in 10 Americans said they did not have enough food in the last seven days, according to new survey data from the Census Bureau out this week. But mounting data suggests those numbers are going up. The Census data also revealed rising in food insufficiency among children over the summer, from 16.8 percent in mid-June to 19.9 percent by mid-July.

In New York City and Los Angeles, roughly one-fifth of residents said over the course of July that they had serious difficulty getting enough food to eat. In Houston, a third of respondents had trouble affording food, according to a poll from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, NPR and Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health

And a slew of COVID-19 relief packages — from unemployment assistance to housing protection — are set to expire by the end of September, weeks ahead of the 2020 presidential election, leaving millions of people vulnerable to worse economic and health outcomes.

Food is one of the first costs people skimp on to try and stay afloat amid turbulent financial straits, and one of the last basic needs to recover once a crisis eases. What someone spends on food “is something that is elastic, as opposed to — your rent is your rent,” said Elaine Waxman, senior fellow at the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

That deprivation can have lasting effects — trouble getting enough food to eat can lay the foundation for chronic illness and reduced health outcomes later in life.

The PBS NewsHour asked health and social safety net experts where the United States stands on food insecurity, who is being hit hardest and what would help people get enough to eat during this crisis.

How we got here

Late last year, before the global rise of COVID-19, one out of 10 U.S. households was food insecure, according to a report published this week from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That amounts to an estimated 35.2 million people, said Alisha Coleman-Jensen, a USDA social science analyst who studies nutrition assistance.

More than half of those households — 58 percent — participated in at least one of the nation’s largest federal nutrition programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and the National School Lunch Program.

Rising unemployment and inflation of food prices are often linked to the number of food-insecure households, Coleman-Jensen said. However, “most food-insecure households are actually employed,” either full-time or part-time, suggesting people’s paychecks don’t go far enough to cover the cost of food, she said during a webinar highlighting the latest USDA report’s findings.

These numbers are comparable to what the Census Bureau found when it asked Americans if they had enough food during the last seven days. For months, the bureau has inquired how households are coping during the pandemic with questions about job status, housing, food, health care and more.

But the way that question is framed could gloss over the realities of food insecurity, which tends to be episodic during the course of a month, Waxman said. People may be fine once they get money or assistance on the first of the month, but by the end of the month, their cash reserves or resources may have dried up. That’s why polls often ask if people have experienced hunger or food insecurity over the last 30 days.

For many in the U.S., financial stability has grown more tenuous in the months since the pandemic began, and could get more dire. With the latest GOP Senate coronavirus relief bill scuttled on Thursday, essentially diminishing hopes of any aid coming before the November election, and federal COVID-19 unemployment insurance set to expire after Dec. 31, more people are struggling to figure out how they will pay rent and eat, Waxman said. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed a federal moratorium on evictions, people are still worried about how they are going to make ends meet. Back in Tupelo, Lawrence said clients come to her and say they don’t know how they can afford rent.

In a year full of examples of the ways systemic racism manifests in all aspects of life, from COVID-19 outcomes to police brutality, food insecurity has also weighed more heavily on Black and brown households than white ones, said Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The health care policy organization, along with partners, surveyed 3,454 Americans between July 1 and Aug. 3 in the nation’s four largest cities — New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston — to see how vulnerable people’s lives and livelihoods have become amid the pandemic. The report detailed how problems were concentrated among Black and Latino households and households with incomes less than $100,000 per year in cities that report some of the nation’s highest cost-of-living. At least half of respondents in each city reported serious financial problems, including trouble paying bills, especially due to medical costs or credit card debt, and fleeced savings.

“Food security is really a basic and fundamental need, and we shouldn’t be experiencing these kinds of problems,” Morita said.

On the ground

After COVID-19 surged in places like New York City and California, it settled into rural pockets of the country over the summer, searing states like Mississippi with some of the country’s worst positivity rates, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Mississippians still suffered among the higher unemployment rates in the country with 10.8 percent of the labor force out of work. And like much of the rest of the country, a disproportionate number of Black Mississippians died after they were infected with the virus, compared to white Mississippians, according to the state department of public health.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry.”

Things got so bad that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves finally issued a statewide face mask mandate on Aug. 4, but stopped short of postponing the start of in-person school days later for thousands of Mississippi children, teachers and staff. Less than a month after classes began, the Mississippi Free Press reported on Aug. 25 that thousands were ordered to stay out of classrooms after hundreds of COVID-19 tests confirmed positive cases in the state’s school system. In the 2019-2020 school year, the USDA said about 357,000 children in Mississippi were qualified to be fed through the National School Lunch Program. That translates to nearly three-quarters of all children in the state’s participating schools.

Mississippi households reported the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity at 15.7 percent late last year, according to the latest USDA data. Since then, Jason Martin has already seen a spike in need at the food pantries he oversees in Northeast Mississippi. As executive director for the Tupelo/Lee County Hunger Coalition, Martin said older residents, who are at greater risk for suffering worse outcomes if infected with COVID-19, fear coming to the pantries to pick up food. At the same time, hundreds of new households are flocking to the food bank because so many people have lost their jobs or been furloughed.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry,” Martin said. He said while the pantry typically restricts people to one visit per month, Martin said he has seen an uptick in people who run out and need more food sooner.

Around the nation, more than four out of 10 people who sought help from food pantries were new and needed services as a result of COVID-19, according to Feeding America, a nonprofit network of more than 200 food banks. Based on what he has seen, Martin said he doesn’t expect food pantry demand to return to pre-pandemic numbers “until 2021, until a vaccine is widely available. You’ve got to see that widely available to the community before things start stabilizing.”

What’s next?

Waxman said she foresees “a real uptick in food insecurity and need” for months, if not years. It took Americans a decade to recover from food insecurity brought on by the Great Recession, she said.

The U.S. didn’t enter this coronavirus-fueled recession completely unprepared. During the 2008 financial crisis, lessons were learned that gave policymakers evidence-based tools and strategies to make sure more Americans get enough nutritious food to eat, she said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping. That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”

One tool they used to stem widespread hunger in the U.S. was boosting food stamp benefits across the board, Waxman said. That gave more food to more people when they needed it, and research supports this tactic for avoiding hunger. That’s why it was included in the HEROES Act, Waxman said, but that coronavirus relief package, which was introduced by House Democrats in May, has sat in Congress.

Research shows that cash infusions, such as the extended $600 payments that went out under the CARES Act passed in March, are vital in keeping American households financially afloat and fed, Waxman said. During the Great Recession, individuals received more than $420 billion in stimulus payments, which helped keep households afloat and prevent further job loss, the Hamilton Project reported.

To fix holes in the social safety net, Waxman urged lawmakers to be more consistent with aid. So far in the crisis, the U.S. has adopted a series of policies that weren’t renewed. One example, she said, was authorizing pandemic EBT, or a special debit card used to redeem food benefits, under the CARES Act, which replaced free or reduced price school meals for children who couldn’t return to the classroom because of COVID-19 and would miss free-or-reduced price breakfast and lunch. This benefit is set to expire on Sept. 30. According to the USDA, roughly 30 million children rely on the National School Lunch Program. But because the U.S. has created a patchwork of state, local and federal responses to a global pandemic, more households are falling through the cracks, Waxman said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping,” she said. “That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”","I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it.
That’s why polls often ask if people have experienced hunger or food insecurity over the last 30 days.
Mississippi households reported the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity at 15.7 percent late last year, according to the latest USDA data.
Waxman said she foresees “a real uptick in food insecurity and need” for months, if not years.
It took Americans a decade to recover from food insecurity brought on by the Great Recession, she said."
59,"Dec 13, 2018",Northside Sun,Beady on Mississippi Food Network,"Dr. Charles Beady is the Chief Executive Officer of Mississippi Food Network (MFN), a food bank that distributes purchased and donated food to approximately 415 member agencies across the state. The member agencies then give the food out to those in need in their respective communities. Beady, a native of Flint, Michigan, earned his bachelor’s degree in advertising, a master’s degree in urban counseling and a doctorate in counselor education all from Michigan State University. Beady recently spoke with Sun reporter Nikki Rowell about the work MFN is doing to eradicate poverty-related hunger in Mississippi.

When did the Mississippi Food Network get started and how?

“In 1984. A group of concerned citizens in the Jackson area got together to discuss issues related to hunger and food insecurity in the Jackson metropolitan area and the result of that meeting was the founding of Mississippi Food Network. It started off with a few thousand pounds and a handful of agencies. We’ve grown from those humble beginnings to our location here on Beatty Street. We have 80,000 square feet of space. We have 33 employees. Last year, we distributed 21.4 million pounds of food around the state to Mississippians who are hungry and food insecure. We distribute that food through a network of agencies. We have 430 agencies that are a part of our network. We are a food bank. A food bank is a charitable organization that receives, warehouses and distributes food to those in need. You don’t necessarily have to be poor to be in need. We are a safety net.”

How is the network working to eliminate poverty-related hunger?

“We’re one of 200 food banks affiliated with Feeding America. Feeding America is the largest organization of its kind in the United States with the mission of trying to eliminate hunger. So, most states have up to five Feeding America affiliated food banks. Mississippi is one of maybe 15 states with only one Feeding America affiliated food bank physically located in the state. We have 56 counties that we’re responsible for getting food to through our 430 agencies. So, if an agency is located outside of a 50-75 mile radius, we will pack up our 18-wheelers and take 40,000 or so pounds of food to a drop-off area and then the agencies in that particular area will pick up their orders and take it back to their respective communities. If they’re within that 75-mile radius, they’ll come to us and pick up their orders to take back to their communities.”

What sort of agencies does MFN distribute through?

“We have contracts through the state of Mississippi that we are responsible for the distribution of federal foods. Most of our agencies are church-related, 501c3. We distribute food through Stewpot, Salvation Army and a number of churches around the state in our service area.”

How many people does the network feed each month?

“About 150,000 through those agencies.”

Could you tell me how many pounds of food are distributed each month?

“We’re moving about a million and a half pounds of food through here a month. That comes out to about 21.4 million pounds each year.”

What is the network’s service area?

“For Feeding America purposes, we cover 56 counties. We distribute food for USDA. For USDA purposes, we’re responsible for getting food to all 82 counties in the state.”

How much is needed annually to keep the network going?

“Our annual operating budget is $3.8 million. So, we need that to do what we do. Let me add also, when you start looking at the hunger figures in Mississippi and nationally, Feeding America figures show us that Mississippi is the hungriest state, statistically speaking. Some 600,000 go to bed either hungry or not knowing where their next meal is coming from. In that regard, we are the hungriest state in the nation. So the need is there.”

What are some of the other programs that the network offers?

“We have a program where we pack up 30-pound boxes to deliver to senior citizens every month. The agencies that I mentioned, we have online ordering where they can become aware of the food we have from USDA and donated. They see what’s on the list and place their ‘orders.’ I say orders in quotes because we don’t sell food to anybody. They order their food electronically and come pick it up and distribute it to the people in need in their respective service areas. We have about 25 backpack programs. Individuals and organizations pack up the food and we will have it distributed to schools in the area. At the end of the week, you provide healthy meals and snacks for them over

See Charles Beady, Page 14A

the weekend. There are many students around the state of Mississippi who rely on the meals provided in the schools in order to stave off hunger and many of them go hungry over the weekend. Hence the need for the backpack program.”

Are the meals and snacks in the backpacks items that children can safely prepare on their own?

“Absolutely. Healthy, nutritious snacks that they can prepare for themselves.”

Can you tell me some of the ways MFN educates the community about healthy food choices and exercise?

“We have nutritionists on staff, and they will go out to the agencies and provide food preparation demonstrations throughout our service area indicating how people can prepare the foods that we make available to them.”

What does it mean to you to have a hand in providing food to those in need?

“This is an extremely satisfying job to be able to see and measure the impact that you’re having on hunger in the state of Mississippi. It’s just a joy to come in in the mornings and see the semi-truck trailers lined up and unloading food in order to get that product out to the people who need it. It is particularly satisfying during the holiday season to know that the work that we do is going to help some youngsters and families throughout the state of Mississippi enjoy a nutritious and hunger-free holiday because of the work that we are doing.”

Do you provide holiday fixings around this time of year?

“We just had a turkey drive. We had a record-breaking year in terms of the number of turkeys that were collected. We collected 2,323 turkeys this year to provide to the agencies that will take and distribute to their respective communities. One of the ways that we are able to provide food is through organizations that will provide food drives for us. The kids over at Madison Central collected four trailer loads of food to bring to the warehouse to allow us to distribute through our agencies.”","Dr. Charles Beady is the Chief Executive Officer of Mississippi Food Network (MFN), a food bank that distributes purchased and donated food to approximately 415 member agencies across the state.

61,"Feb 2, 2020",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Several Mississippi counties top list of most disadvantaged areas in the country,"CLOSE Income tends to be lower and poverty rates higher in rural counties compared to urban counties. Cincinnati Enquirer

Mississippi communities are among the most disadvantaged in the nation, based on income levels, health and social mobility, according to a recent study.

A recent analysis by researchers at the University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions initiative and Princeton University’s Center for Research on Child Wellbeing created a nationwide index for counties it found to be at a ""deep disadvantage"" in the country.

The study looked at poverty and deep poverty rates, life expectancy and low birth rates, among other factors.

It revealed five separate counties in Mississippi in the top 10 list as the most poor areas in the nation.

Those counties and their rank are:

3. Claiborne County

4. Issaquena County

5. Holmes County

7. Leflore County

9. Coahoma County

The study also listed a total 21 counties in the state in its top 100 index, which represents more than 20% of the entire country.

Child hunger in Mississippi is real: Let's solve the food insecurity problem.

The study— in its analysis— found three trends:

Rural counties are much more likely to be disadvantaged. Of the top 100 most disadvantaged communities, 80 are rural—including 19 rural counties in Mississippi. Only nine are cities. This finding is significant because rural areas are more likely to lack infrastructure and investment to alleviate poverty.

Disadvantage is clustered and largely driven by historical context. Regions with high levels of disadvantage include the Mississippi Delta, the Cotton Belt, Appalachia, Tribal Nation Lands, areas near the Texas-Mexico border and the Rust Belt cities of Cleveland; Detroit; Flint, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. One theme across these areas of deep disadvantage is a long history of racial and environmental exploitation.

Disparities in health and economic outcomes: In terms of health, people living in the most disadvantaged areas are more likely to die a full 10 years before their counterparts in the most advantaged areas. The average poverty rate of the 100 most disadvantaged communities (34.8%) is more than four times higher than the poverty rate among the 100 most advantaged communities (7.3%).

Tof the Mississippi counties in the top 10 are along the Mississippi River. Four of the counties in the top 10 are located in South Dakota, home to the Native American Sovereign Tribal Nations.

The state of Mississippi has long ranked at the bottom when it comes to obesity, with data suggesting that nearly 75 percent of residents in the Magnolia State are overweight.But not everyone is getting a seat at the table. There is also research showing that many people, including children, are living hungry in Mississippi.“I don’t understand how, and why, you know, people go hungry in Jackson,” said Dave Melton, sensei at Melton School of Martial Arts.Feeding America says more than 61,000 people living in Hinds County are food insecure, meaning they can’t afford to consistently feed their families. That’s 25 percent of the county's population.“But in some areas, it’s up to 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent of the residents are dealing with food insecurity,” said Tyson Jackson, program coordinator for Jackson Meals Matter. To make matters worse, a lot of residents live in food deserts, which are in areas without grocery stores.“Growing up in Jackson, there were grocery stores everywhere, and we've seen, again, that economic divestment, and so, when individuals don't have access to sustainable food, healthy fruit, vegetables, meats, dairy products in walking distance of where they live, then that limits their access,” said Dr. Ebony Lumumba, first lady of Jackson.The Jackson Meals Matter program is getting a strong push from Lumumba.“I think our overall goal, to summarize it, is: Make sure that every child in the city of Jackson has access to three meals a day, every day,” Jackson said.“We’re at schools, community centers, churches, community organizations,” Lumumba said. “We simply need people who have the facility to prepare the meals and to serve them to the population. We’re hoping to bring them into the community and not ask the community to come to us.”Lumumba said this is phase one of Jackson Meals Matter. It’s already paying dividends for the children at the Melton School of Martial Arts.“The food is really good, but it’s not enough for some,” Melton said.Melton would like to see the program allow children to take food with them. There is a need, not just in Jackson, but in every part of the metro.“I do get $60 a month in SNAP benefits, but $60 a month doesn’t feed three people,” said Mary Craker.Craker is confined to a wheelchair, has very limited income and is raising her sister’s two daughters. Craker said she was too ashamed to ask for help, but she got over her fears and now receives help from the food pantry at Wynndale Baptist Church in Terry. “Pick up the phone and call somebody. The Mississippi Food Network will help you, in more ways than one,” Craker said.","THIS IS FOOD REDLINING...THIS IS FOOD APARTHEID ON A PEOPLE.

65,"Aug 27, 2020",WSAW,Chopped champ Nick Wallace raises awareness about food insecurity and how communities can help,"WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Having access to healthy food is a global challenge and one that impacts thousands of US cities and over 40 million people nationwide. For many Americans -- particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and rural areas -- small grocery stores that once helped to feed the community have been closed and replaced by convenience stores, and liquor stores that primarily sell ultra-processed junk and snack foods.

According to Feeding America, even in the world’s greatest food-producing nation, children and adults face poverty and hunger in every county across America. The statistics are alarming:

In 2018, more than 37 million people struggled with hunger in the United States, including more than 11 million children.

A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life.

Children are more likely to face food insecurity than any other group in the United States.

In Mississippi—which has the highest obesity rate of any state—over 70 percent of food stamp eligible households travel more than 30 miles to reach a supermarket. Adults living in “food desert” counties lacking large supermarkets are 23 percent less likely to consume the recommended fruits and vegetables than those in counties with supermarkets. As part of Dole’s promise to sustainably provide good nutrition for 1 billion people by increasing access to under-served communities, the brand recently launched an initiative, partnering with Boys & Girls Club, Up in Farms, Smoothie King, which addresses nutritional access and education needs in one of America’s largest food deserts.

Nationally recognized Chef Nick Wallace joined NewsChannel 7 at 4 on Thursday to discuss food insecurity, how we can educate communities about proper nutrition, and how people can help in their own communities. He also showcased simple, healthy dishes that promote optimal nutrition and discussed the unique approach Dole is taking by empowering kids to make better choices by learning about where their food comes from and how to cook it.

66,"Dec 21, 2019",NPR,New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion,"New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Danny Moloshok/AP Danny Moloshok/AP

Some low-income college students are among the 688,000 food stamp recipients projected to lose benefits as a result of a Trump administration rule announced Dec. 4. While the rule explicitly targets ""able-bodied adults without dependents,"" it also limits food assistance for a share of college students at a time when campuses across the country are grappling with how to respond to food insecurity.

The new rule makes it harder for states to waive the requirement that adults work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — benefits. Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.

""As long as a student is at least half-time, they are not considered an [able-bodied adult without dependents] subject to SNAP work requirements, so that new rule would not impact them,"" says Kathryn Larin, director of the Education Workforce and Income Security Team at the Government Accountability Office. ""The group that it would impact would be students enrolled less than half-time.""

Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

This is because Congress created the program with the image of a ""traditional"" student in mind: someone entering college directly from high school, financially reliant on their parents, with no income or dependents.

But this archetype is far from universal, says Parker Gilkesson, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy who specializes in income and work supports. Only about 1 in 4 students attend a four-year institution immediately after high school.

Many college students are older or are parents themselves. And few have a financial safety net: Countless families are spending all they have just to send their children to college, let alone pay for their food and other necessities, she says.

""[Congress] did recognize there are circumstances where students could and should be eligible for SNAP, and so they set up a number of exceptions from this prohibition against college students getting SNAP,"" Larin said. ""What are those exemptions, who is eligible for them, how do you meet those exemptions? That's where the confusion comes in.""

In order for college students to be eligible for SNAP, they must first meet income and asset limits, household qualifications and immigration status requirements. Those who are enrolled less than half of the time — as defined by their school — can then qualify under standard SNAP rules.

Students enrolled more than half of the time may qualify for SNAP by meeting one of a number of criteria, which include being responsible for a dependent child younger than 6, working at least 20 hours a week in paid employment, receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, participating in an on-the-job training program, being outside the 18-49 age range, and being unable to work for health reasons.

""No matter if they're full time, part time, half time, even taking one class, [students] are taking the initiative to really better themselves and grow and further their academic career,"" Gilkesson says. ""They shouldn't be punished for not being able to find steady employment in the economy that we are in today.""

Gilkesson says it is unclear exactly how many students will lose benefits as a result of the new rule, particularly because able-bodied adults without dependents are not necessarily also classified as students if they are enrolled part time. But she adds it is clear that the rule will disproportionately impact young people, people of color and those who struggle to find employment, leaving them without much-needed food assistance.

""Most people who receive SNAP who can work, do work,"" she says. ""But there are a lot of jobs and specifically low-wage jobs out here that have volatile schedules ... people can be let go at any time, so we shouldn't allow people to go hungry just based on their ability to maintain work.""

According to National Center for Education Statistics data on unduplicated year-round enrollment, 5.8 million students were enrolled in public two-year colleges in fall 2017. About 2.1 million were full time, and 3.7 million were part time. Gilkesson says that while there are more students enrolled part time in community colleges than in four-year institutions, food insecurity exists on all types of campuses.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat. This was among the findings of a 2018 Government Accountability Office report that also said almost 2 million at-risk students who were potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits in 2016.

Only 4 in 10 students who are potentially eligible for SNAP are actually enrolled in the program, according to Gilkesson. This is due to perceived stigma as well as confusion about who can apply for SNAP and how to do so.

""The information that's available from the USDA ... is difficult to find on their website and also hard to understand, it's very legal language,"" says Larin, adding that people whose jobs it is to connect college students with these resources may struggle to understand the criteria. Advocates worry that the new rule will exacerbate this confusion.

The GAO report released last December made two recommendations: that the Food and Nutrition Service (which is part of U.S. Department of Agriculture) improve the information on its website to make it easier to find and understand, and that it take a more active role in sharing states' best practices for connecting students to SNAP. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations but has not yet implemented them as of mid-December 2019.

Gilkesson received SNAP in college and was a SNAP worker at a county agency in North Carolina prior to her current job. She says it was not until she saw the other side of the ""intricate"" process that she realized how much information she never received as a student, both because she didn't know what to tell workers and because they didn't always know what to ask.

As a SNAP worker, she saw the impact that fresh food and hot meals had on clients' lives.

""You need food to live, you need food to work, you need food to thrive,"" Gilkesson says. ""And hunger does not make people more employable either.""

In fact, she adds, hunger makes it harder for people to find well-paying jobs that align with their skills and often leads to cycles of being laid off, having to find a new job quickly and missing out on the opportunity to gain the education, training and skills necessary for more meaningful and sustainable employment.

She says research shows that SNAP encourages work and that the idea that people experiencing poverty don't want to get jobs is ""implicit bias.""

The Trump administration says the new rule is intended to promote SNAP recipients entering the workforce. Critics have slammed the change for eliminating food assistance for nearly 700,000 people, many of whom already struggle to find work.

Gilkesson says it is concerning that college students will lose benefits, but the prevalence of food insecurity should be an issue regardless of who is experiencing it.

""No one should be hungry,"" she says. ""That's a basic necessity. And when we start to think about it in that way, we really will start to see the policy change that we need to see.""

67,"Sep 17, 2019",Mississippi Public Broadcasting,Farmers Markets Bring Together Communities in Mississippi Delta,"Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming. It was founded by former slaves, and agriculture was part of its history from the beginning. But by the mid-1960s, many African Americans in this part of state were starving. It was so bad that then U.S .Senator Robert F. Kennedy traveled to Mississippi to investigate. Fast forward 50 years and food insecurity is still a problem. But as MPB’s Alexandra Watts reports, there’s a program that’s trying to tackle hunger – one fresh vegetable at a time.

It’s a Saturday morning in Mound Bayou, and LeBroderick Woods is making sure everything is in order for the day for the weekly mobile market put on by Delta Fresh Foods Initiative.

“These are some sweet potatoes that are about 89 cents per pound that were picked out at the Alcorn [State University] farm this morning,” Woods, who is the market manager, points out as he walks around the market. “Here is okra that’s about a dollar and 25 cents per pound.”

Shopper Angela Henderson eyes boxes of red and green tomatoes, potatoes and okra. She’s here because her small town does not have a grocery store.

“It helps us a lot to get everything we need in one place,” Henderson said after buying okra for her meal. “It is very economical and very healthy.”

In addition to Mound Bayou, the mobile market sets up in Shelby and Winstonville on alternating weekends. The market is always parked in a central location so people can walk to it.

Woods said the nearest grocery store is nine miles and a highway away.

“It’s been a struggle. Mound Bayou is considered to be a food desert because they’re so far away from your nearest Walmart – you have to go to Clarksdale or Cleveland, and if you don’t have transportation, that can be a big issue,” Woods said. “One of the hugest parts is transportation and getting to the locally grown food or fresh food.”

The options close by are not the healthiest options.

“[There are] no stores. We have a Bob's Express that sells fried chicken. But nobody around here in the Mound Bayou area sells fresh produce,” Tanielle Woods explains.

Woods is a college sophomore and youth ambassador with the market. Today, she is one of three youth ambassadors at the market.

Listen to Tannielle Woods on healthy eating:

“My name is Tanielle Woods, I am a sophomore at Mississippi Delta Community College and my major is physical therapy. I’m young and in college and I thought that maybe eating noodles and fried chicken was okay, but eating healthy is not bad.”

The youth ambassadors help grow the food and work in the market. As Woods describes it, they are there from “seed to consumer.”

“They'll bring the price down [on] the unhealthy things and the healthy things we have to pay an arm and a leg for,” said Samuel Ferguson, another youth ambassador. The market accepts cash, card and SNAP benefits.

“I think it's important for every community to have fresh produce and have it for cheap, affordable prices, so we can get it.”

Price and transportation concerns went into how the market runs. Before starting the market, Delta Fresh Foods Initiative surveyed community members to see what they wanted.

Rachael Carter of Mississippi State University said community engagement offers more to rural markets.

“In rural communities when they don't have those options of grocery stores, a market can come in and set up wherever they want to have it in the community,” Carter said. “You can put it where people can walk to the market [and] provide a variety of farm produced products. That’s a wonderful thing for a community that just lost a grocery store.”

In Bolivar County, more than one in four people don’t have reliable access to quality food. In Mississippi, around 16 percent of households are food insecure – and the state ranks second in the nation. Many of the most food insecure regions are in the Mississippi Delta.

A United States Department of Agriculture study found that food insecurity is associated with ten chronic diseases. According to County Health Rankings, Bolivar County’s quality of life ranks 72 out 81 Mississippi counties.

Down the road from the market is The Delta Health Center, which opened in the mid 1960s and was one of the first of its kind in the country. According to Out in the Rural: A Health Center in Mississippi and its War on Poverty by Thomas J. Ward Jr., current issues like transportation and health were prevalent in Bolivar County and the Delta years ago.

David Holben, a professor and director of Food and Nutrition Studies at the University of Mississippi, said these health issues still exist.

“I think people equate the health problems we have in our state and nation to over-nutrition and access to too much food,” Holben said. “When in reality, it might be [that] we have access to high fat and high sugar food that tastes good, and yet are lacking nutrients.”



But Holben said having farmers markets can benefit communities.

“So farmers markets do definitely increase access to healthy food available in rural communities,” Holben said. “They do play a crucial role in people having access to fresh and healthy food in their local area. We’re really talking about a local food system.”

“When farmers markets are in communities and people are using it, there is a health benefit in terms of improved diet,” Darcy Freedman of Case Western Reserve University said. But she also notes farmers markets is not a sole health solution.

“It’s going to be a compilation of many factors that are overall making healthy foods more affordable [and] making them more available in addition to other things like promoting walkability and economic opportunity.”

Back at the market, Henry Herman stands near a red wheelbarrow loaded with green watermelon. Herman had a stroke a few years ago, and said he’s learned about the importance of healthy eating.

“If you get healthy food like it was back in the day, I guarantee there would be a lot less people dying or having health problems,” Herman said.

Larry Haywood also stops by the market. He’s a local grower who is helping the youth ambassadors growing the food.

He, too, has had health issues and says there is a power in eating better.

“You don’t realize that until you start eating healthier...and you realize how to eat to live rather than live to eat,” Haywood said.

LeBroderick Woods on what a ""Good Food Revolution"" Means:



""Because it’s a change. It’s a paradigm change -- it’s a paradigm change for the community. We’ve gotten so stuck on instant gratification – your Big Macs, your quick meals and things of that nature. We’ve kind of gotten away from things we were raised on – the fresh produce and grandmama’s cooking and things of that nature. So good food is not just good tasting, it’s good for the spirit. It’s good overall. It build character even if you will.""

Right now, the market is only in Mound Bayou once every three weeks, but LeBroderick Woods wants to see it expand.

“I hope it grows to us having our own market here, and it being a consistent thing throughout the week -- not just a Saturday event,” says Woods, who comes back every week to his hometown. That it’s something that can be prominent and it lasts through seasons – summer, winter, fall all of the above. That it’s our own Walmart or grocery store here in Mound Bayou.”

Delta Fresh Foods Initiative hopes customers walk away with more than just fresh produce. The organization wants them to learn how to live and eat healthier.","Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming.

68,"Sep 15, 2020",Cheddar,"Dole Tackling Food Deserts Starting With Jackson, Mississippi, Says Exec","The global issue of food insecurity has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic but Dole, the world's largest fruit and vegetable producer, is pledging to bring healthy options to one billion people by 2025 in their #SunshineForAll initiative.

The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

""Within that area, only about 5 percent of those grocery stores supply locally-sourced produce, he said. ""There's about 20 grocery stores in the city. That's about one for every 10,000 people.""

When it comes to assessing a location as food insecure or not, Bartlett said there are a number of factors that come into play.

""It really has a situation of numbers of people, grocery stores, and the amount of fresh produce and nutritious foods that are available in a particular populous. Really, within a food desert only about maybe 23 percent or so of the people have access to fresh produce,"" he added.

Dole decided to first introduce its #SunshingForAll campaign to Jackson due to the city's lack of accessible public transportation, a surplus of fast food establishments, and a median income of just over $35,000, Bartlett said.

While many communities are impacted by a lack of adequate access to healthier food options, Dole is leaning on the public to help the company decide which locations should be next. Bartlett said all people have to do is log on to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter and explain to the company why their location qualifies as a food desert while using the tag #SunshineForAll.

""We're looking forward to expanding this. This is something that is an ability for us to get in and help to spread knowledge and awareness, affordability, accessibility, and also to improve the education of an area about healthy products, nutrition,"" Bartlett said.","The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

70,"Dec 20, 2019",Jackson Free Press,City to Provide 500 Meals to Jackson Children Over Holidays,"Several local nonprofits will unite this holiday season to provide 500 free meals to young people in Jackson as part of ongoing efforts to fight food insecurity in the city and state, which currently ranks first nationwide in food insecurity.

On Dec. 23, the Jackson Meals Matter program team up with Chefs for the Culture and the Love JXN: Save Ourselves campaign to cook and distribute hot meals at the Grove Park Community Center in northwest Jackson. The event, titled ""Holiday Meals for Jackson's Kids,"" will begin at 11 a.m. and end at 2 p.m.

As the poorest state in America, food insecurity is especially profound in Mississippi. Approximately 600,840 Mississippians, or one in four people, do not have access to enough food. One-quarter of children in the state and more than half of Mississippi's elderly population go to sleep hungry.

In Hinds County alone, 61,720 people go without enough food. As the Mississippi Food Network points out, the food-insecure population of Hinds County is larger than the hungry population in all of North Dakota.

Food insecurity is linked to numerous adverse health effects. For children, lack of access to nutrient-rich foods can lead to developmental problems and poor educational outcomes. Because unhealthy foods tend to be cheaper than nutrient-rich ones, families who are struggling to make ends meet are more likely to consume foods that harm their physical health. And since families must often decide between placing food on the table or meeting their other basic needs, food insecurity has also been linked to housing and transportation insecurity and lack of access to medical care.

Summers and holiday vacations are particularly difficult times for families struggling with food insecurity, as school breakfasts and lunches are the only times that a child may eat during the day. Mississippi ranks 47th in the country for child participation in school summer lunch programs, the Food Research and Action Center reports. Only 8% of Mississippi kids ages 18 and younger are currently enrolled in summer lunch programs.

The average cost of a meal in Mississippi is $2.93, the nonprofit Feeding America found. The agency estimates that an additional $286,997,000 in funds is required to overhaul food insecurity in Mississippi.

In 2018, the City of Jackson received a $120,000 grant from the National League of Cities to combat hunger. The City used the money to launch the Jackson Meals Matter program.

Children can pick up meals at the Grove Park Community Center on 4126 Parkway Ave. from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. For more information or to volunteer, reach out to Tyler Jackson at [email protected] or 601-201-7324.

71,"Mar 18, 2020",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Mississippi lawmakers' response to COVID-19 inadequate. Here's what should happen: Column,"CLOSE Best friends Savannah Hahn of Petal and Holly Johnson of Pearl talk coronavirus difficulties and fears. Mississippi Clarion Ledger

The new coronavirus has ushered in uncertainty for everyone, and this is especially true for low-income families and vulnerable populations across our state. The pandemic is heightening the uncertainty, financial instability and food insecurity faced by one in five Mississippians every day. It's also illuminating the dangers of inadequate access to affordable and quality health care and the desperate need for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed HR 6201, the Coronavirus Response Act. This act, in part, allows:

Expanded access to SNAP, WIC, and the emergency food assistance program during the pandemic;

Immediate paid sick leave and paid family leave, expanded unemployment insurance, vital nutrition aid;

More Medicaid funds for states; and

Free COVID-19 testing and treatment, including for Americans without health coverage.

What do Mississippi’s legislators do in the face of the unprecedented challenges caused by the spread of this pandemic? Do they rush to draft legislation to ensure protections for its most vulnerable citizens? No. Also on Tuesday, the Mississippi House of Representatives declared a three-week recess, effectively stalling any relief struggling Mississippians might receive. The Mississippi Senate suspended its session the following day.

Mississippi coronavirus: What state employees need to know

Session halted: Mississippi lawmakers reject bill

As we are all too aware, when it comes to this virus, a lot can happen in three weeks. For many Mississippians, it is the difference between life and death. I implore Mississippians to contact U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker to voice support for the Coronavirus Response Act and to contact their state representatives to urge compassionate action in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our elected officials’ failure to act immediately and decisively in the face of such imminent disaster is unconscionable and unacceptable. Contact your state legislator to demand the following actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Expand Medicaid to increase access to COVID-19 treatment for 163,000+ low-income Mississippians.

Leverage TANF dollars to offer emergency sick leave to low-income families.

Lift the legislature's 2017 prohibition on SNAP work requirement waivers previously available during economic downturns and job shortages. The pandemic illustrates the fragility of the service industry and many low-wage job opportunities.

Exempt groceries from Mississippi's general sales tax. Mississippi is one of just three states without a tax break on groceries, heightening hunger and poor health.

Place a moratorium on evictions, following the lead of several states and cities doing the same nationwide. Jackson's eviction rate is among the highest in the country and Mississippi's new law authorizing immediate eviction is among the harshest.

72,"May 22, 2020",,More American children could go hungry during pandemic,"Feeding America released a study this week, which examines food insecurity at a more local level. The study found that in some regions of the US, more than half of all children could be considered “food insecure.”

Food insecurity is defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. In areas such as Kusilvak, Alaska and East Carrol Parish, LA, more than half of all children will lack consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

In Louisiana, more than one in three children are projected to be “food insecure” this year. New Mexico, West Virginia, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama and Nevada join Texas as states with projected child food insecurity rates of more than 30%.

The state that will see the largest per capita jump in food insecurity is North Dakota, with its rate of food insecure children nearly doubling. But North Dakota had a low food insecurity rate before the pandemic.

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

Last month, Feeding America announced that it projected a $1.4 billion budget shortfall through the fall to handle the influx of demand at food banks nationwide.

“The people we serve and the charitable food system in the United States are facing a ‘perfect storm,’ with surges in demand, declines in food donations and volunteers, and disruptions to normal operating procedures, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Babineaux-Fontenot. “It is all of our neighbors who now more than ever need help putting food on their tables.”

76,"Jul 6, 2020",FoodNavigator-USA.com,"‘The nation is going to need all of our help,’ Chobani president says unveiling new charity SKU","All profits from the new Food Bank Batch SKU will be donated to Feeding America, an organization of more than 200 food banks that provides meals to those in need – a number that the non-profit estimates could climb an additional 17.1 million this year due to the pandemic.

Even though some states are starting to reopen their economies, “we are still very much living with this virus … and the situation hasn’t changed fundamentally. If you look at the economy, if you look at the number of unemployed, the case rate – they are very similar to where they were a couple of months ago. And the way we see it, the nation is going to need all of our help,”​ to get through the pandemic and economic downturn, Chobani president Peter McGuinness told FoodNavigator-USA.

He explained that with the launch of this new charity SKU, Chobani “continues to do our part through food to help people who are unemployed, underemployed and hurting.”​

Chobani’s Food Bank Batch allows Mississippi Food Network to feed more children this summer​ When Chobani emailed Mississippi Food Network earlier this summer to share that it would be launching a limited-edition Greek yogurt to raise money for Feeding America food banks, program manager Catherine Montgomery said she was “so excited and felt so blessed”​ because the donation meant feeding more children who rely on school lunches during the summer. She explained to FoodNavigator-USA that nearly a quarter of children in Mississippi suffer from food insecurity and many rely on schools and child feeding sites for what might be their only meal of the day. But when the coronavirus pandemic broke out, many schools discontinued their feeding programs to minimize risk of exposure to staff and families. “When I learned that we had been blessed with $20,000”​ as part of Chobani’s donation, “we were able to think outside of the box a little bit and… purchase shelf stable summer meals for our summer feeding sites in Sharkey County and Issaquena County, which are two very rural, low-income counties in the state of Mississippi,”​ she said. “We are gong to kick this program off on [July 6] and anticipate running hopefully until Aug. 7, through which the funding will allows us to give 8,000 meals for these two counties to share,”​ she said, adding, “We are so excited for this opportunity and very, very, very thankful for the funding to do so.”​ While not all CPG players are able to give as much as Chobani, Montgomery said that Feeding America is appreciative of all donations – of any size and either as funds or in-kind donations. “Funding is always appreciated. For every $1 donated to the Mississippi Food Network, we’re able to provide six meals, and 95 cents of every dollar goes directly to our programs,”​ she said. “We are also very thankful for anything and everything that does come through the warehouse as in-kind donations, because they allow us to provide more for these families. We don’t take any donation – big or small – for granted.”​ Beyond food and funds, Montgomery said MFN was grateful to receive donations from others earlier this year to expand its fleet of delivery trucks and drivers to meet increased demand. She also said companies have helped by offering advertising that allows MFN and Feeding America to tell their story and educate communities about what is available. While MFN continues to welcome help feeding communities now, Montgomery said that the organization – and likely other food banks nationwide – also need help planning for the future to ensure there is sufficient food for the coming months as well. “Normally we’re gearing up for food drop season, but what we have done to be a little creative in the midst of our current season of life is we’ve begun doing virtual food drops … and we are planning to continue that through the fall,”​ she said. She explained that this approach allows the food banks to stockpile for the lean winter months and holiday season, but without putting additional strain on the food chain and grocery stores now. It also reduces the risk of contaminants entering the warehouse. “The virtual food drives are a great option for those who want to help but not be a hindrance and it is an easy way to assist us in meeting our goals and mission,”​ she said. But, she emphasized again, MFN and Feeding America are grateful for any and all support.

In addition to financially benefiting Feeding America, McGuinness said Chobani hopes the SKU will help shoppers by offering them a new flavor that hasn’t been available before in yogurt and nutritional profile that will lift their spirits and support their health.

“The combination of peanut butter and jelly is delicious and super nostalgic. It is a comfort food and will put a smile on your face” – ​two things that many Americans need as they continue to navigate frustrations associated with social distancing, McGuinness said.

Likewise, each cup of yogurt is made with three cups of milk, which means they deliver “a lot of protein and lot of probiotics. Plus, the peanut butter adds healthy fats. So, it is great nutritionally, in addition to being a lot of fun in terms of the flavor,”​ he added.

Chobani’s support expands beyond new product​

The charity SKU is the latest in a long string of donations that Chobani has made since the outbreak began to help feed Americans, many of whom have lost jobs during the pandemic due to restrictions designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

For example, when the company was forced to close temporarily its SoHo Café as part of a larger economic shut down to stem the coronavirus, it quickly converted the space to a food pantry to serve the local community by passing out bags of donated food from Chobani and several startups and other partners.

In addition, the company has supported Feeding America by donating every day a truck load of fresh product to food banks​ and intake centers nationwide, providing media support and labor.

“We have hit the majority of states at this point, and the donations go where the need is most and grievous, and that is determined by the amount of food, Feeding America and local and community banks,”​ McGuinness said. “We also encourage our employees [in the area] to go and meet the trucks and help unpack and donate it … because these foodbanks not only need the food, they also need the labor.”​

A track record of success​

The Food Bank Batch is not the first time that Chobani has created a charity SKU to raise funds and awareness for a social challenge.

In late 2018, Chobani created a “patriotic”​ Red, White and Blueberry vanilla Greek yogurt with mixed berries​ on the bottom called Hero Batch that asked consumers to “help us donate $1 million to Operation Homefront,”​ a national non-profit that serves America’s military families.

While the SKU was originally planned as a limited edition, consumers loved the flavor and supporting veterans so much that McGuinness said Chobani decided to continue the product.

The company also recently launched a Milk & Cookies SKU around the Milk Matters initiative that supported dairy farmers through the American Farmland Trust. The company donated 10 cents from every four-pack of the SKU to the American Farmland Trust, which focuses on protecting farmland, adopting environmentally-sound farming practices and keeping farmers on the land.

‘Greek yogurt is booming’​

Chobani’s effort to support those in need and its community also come at a time when the business – like all CPG players – faces many challenges due to COVID-19, including uncertainties about whether retailers will review and bring in new products while simultaneously struggling to keep shelves stocked with basics.

McGuinness confirmed though that “the vast majority of our customers will have resets,”​ in July and January – allowing the company to unveil soon “big exciting”​ innovations in Greek yogurt.

“Greek is growing double-digits and I think yogurt is a growth category. It was a growth category before COVID at the end of last year, and it was really turbocharged in the first quarter and now is even higher with COVID because people want healthy snacks, they want probiotics for immunity and protein,”​ McGuinness said.

“So,”​ he added, “we have a large Greek yogurt innovation coming out and we continue to see yogurt as underpenetrated.”​

This month, the company also plans to unveil a new beverage innovation and additional Flips, which McGuinness noted are “just really nice, fun and healthy snacks.” ​In January, he added, the company has a “huge pipeline that will get us in even more categories”​ outside of yogurt.

While McGuinness does not believe any company can take credit for surging sales during the pantry-loading days of the pandemic, he does believe that as consumers continue to eat at home more and buy yogurt that they are forming new habits, which he doesn’t anticipate will change any time soon.","And the way we see it, the nation is going to need all of our help,”​ to get through the pandemic and economic downturn, Chobani president Peter McGuinness told FoodNavigator-USA.
She also said companies have helped by offering advertising that allows MFN and Feeding America to tell their story and educate communities about what is available.

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s food pantry is now known as Grove Grocery and though the name is different, its student-led fight against hunger and the stigma around food insecurity continues.

Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213. Workers wear masks and follow all campus protocols while they serve students. It’s open 3-8 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays and noon to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.

It’s exciting to see the organization grow to be able to help more students, and also help them in new ways, said Chloe Grant, Grove Grocery director and a senior biology major from St. Louis.

“One of my main goals as the food pantry’s director is to help de-stigmatize food insecurity and to help people feel more comfortable with getting the resources they deserve,” Grant said. “I think many students, faculty and staff don’t use the food pantry because they’re embarrassed or because they feel like they aren’t needy enough.

“However, we want everyone to know that we’re here to help them – without judgement – so that they can focus on what really matters in life.”

Grove Grocery has received a $10,000 donation from Kroger, which is part of a new and continuing partnership. Company representatives visited Grove Grocery recently and recorded video interviews with Ole Miss students to share with Kroger employees across the Delta region.

There’s also an Ignite campaign to benefit the pantry and help it to serve as many students and others as possible.

Many people find themselves struggling financially during the ongoing pandemic, said Kate Forster, staff adviser for Grove Grocery. Usage has gone up, including an increased need for hygiene products and other personal items, she said.

“Our utilization has gone up,” Forster said. “It has brought a spotlight to the work of Grove Grocery, and the needs on campus. We would think that on a campus like this and in a place so rich with resources, students would never go hungry. Still, many students are facing very difficult monthly decisions.

“We always want to raise awareness about our services in a de-stigmatizing way. We really try to remove as many barriers as possible to students and employees finding what they need.”

Here’s a full list of Grove Grocery’s services.

While usage has gone up, donations have increased, as well. Forster believes many people find themselves wanting to help others during COVID. She said its rewarding to see the work at Grove Grocery is both student-led and heavily supported by students.

“One in three college students during their undergraduate years will experience food insecurity,” Forster said. “This semester, we’ve given out over 1,800 meals and more than 700 meal swipes.

“We are in a good place to support the community’s needs, and we want to raise awareness. There is a lot of good happening here.”

The pantry takes feedback from clients about their needs, and collects those items. They’ve also partnered to provide “meal swipes” on student and employee ID cards. Those who need swipes can apply here.

Grove Grocery is a good way to help those in need, especially now, said Kieran Murphy, assistant director and a junior management major from Ocean Springs.

“We have so many important goals and ideas we try to implement so that we can ensure the most people get the help they need,” Murphy said. “I am very humbled and honored to serve in a role that allows me to feel that I’m making a difference in people’s lives, and it will always be an experience I will remember and cherish.”

Mary Beth Gillespie, another Grove Grocery assistant director and a senior biology major from Brandon, said she first heard of the pantry as a sophomore. It’s become a “passion project” for her because it helps so many, she said.

“Working with the food pantry has not only impacted my time at Ole Miss, but it has also shaped my outlook on my future and how I would like to continue to combat food insecurity as someone pursuing a career in dentistry,” Gillespie said. “The food pantry is continuing to grow and expand, and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store.”","Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213.

80,"Jul 18, 2019",YES! Magazine,How Southern Communities Tackle Summertime Food Scarcity,"Without free and reduced school lunch programs during the summer, many children go hungry. Local organizations and churches are stepping up to help to narrow the food gap. Why you can trust us By Tina Vasquez 6 MIN READ

Jasmine Caston’s weekdays begin before the sun rises. A single mother of two daughters, Caston works full time and goes to school. Every day is a juggling act. To be sure it goes well, she and her children need to be out of the house no later than 6:20 a.m. Nine months of the year, this isn’t a big problem. The girls are in school. But summertime? That’s a different story. A mythology surrounding school’s summer vacation days is that they’re fun and restorative for children and their families. But this mythology has rarely applied to low-income families of color, especially across the American South, where the rates of poverty and food insecurity in the country are highest. “As a parent at work, you worry about your children,” Caston says. “I have to work to maintain the bills, but it’s a struggle, especially to make sure the children are safe and taken care of. I get paid every two weeks and I make minimum wage.” After paying rent, bills, and transportation-related costs, not much is left, she says. Caston has spent her life in Jackson, Mississippi, a state that has the highest rate of child poverty in the nation at 30%. That number surges for African American children in the state, 46% of whom are in poverty.

The mother of two says she’s lucky. Her extended family helps out some. Last year, her parents assisted her with the $80/week fee for a local summer program. These programs can be a huge added expense for families, especially during the summer, when many families struggle with food scarcity. Breakfast and lunch are provided during the school year, but during those three months of summer, many parents struggle to find the funds for these meals. “When they’re at home all day during the summer, it takes extra money and extra food,” Caston explains. “When I was growing up, I remember my mom going to the grocery store three to four times a week. When growing kids are at home all day, they’re constantly opening the refrigerator. Breakfast, snacks, drinks, lunch, it adds up so fast. It’s such a struggle for parents.” The summertime meal gap is the result of access barriers experienced by families like Caston’s, including limited resources when schools are closed. During the school year, 22 million children receive free or reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program, according to the organization Feeding America. When school is out during the summer, however, only 3.76 million receive free or reduced-price meals through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Summer Food Service Program. The SFSP is a federally funded, state-administered program that reimburses providers who serve free meals to children and teens in low-income areas during the summer months.

The summertime meal gap is the result of access barriers, including limited resources when schools are closed.

Many families, however, don’t know about the program. Other inefficiencies, such as the “the congregant feeding requirement,” which necessitates the children eat at designated locations, make the program less effective in some communities, according to the No Kid Hungry Campaign. But Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks, operates several summer food service programs, with the help of SFSP funds, to assist low-income families who face hunger during the summer months. Last year, they served 10 million meals to more than 269,500 hungry children. And some churches and community organizations across the South are forming their own networks to try to end the summertime food gap, with funding from the state and local nonprofits. In Jackson, leaders make sure healthy and nutritious meals come with mentorship and educational opportunities for young people. This includes a free summer camp through the Mississippi Urban League. Caston’s daughters are enrolled in the camp, and she calls it “a blessing.” Beneta Burt is the president and CEO of the Mississippi Urban League, which for 15 years operated as the Mississippi Roadmap to Health Equity. Burt’s primary goal has been addressing health and food disparities in Jackson. While the Mississippi Urban League has long provided summer programs, only recently did the organization partner with the Mississippi Food Network to launch a food pantry, which feeds as many as 50 children breakfast and lunch during the summer.

Burt says it would have been a missed opportunity not to include academic, cultural enrichment, and health and wellness activities as well. “As part of our program, we want young people to also learn important core values. So while it’s very important to us that they have two good meals a day, the other major component is academic and making sure we prevent learning losses during the summer months,” she adds.

Church members want to establish a relationship with all the children, and to let them know they are cared for.

This year, part of the summer program is being funded by 100 Black Men of Jackson, an organization that provides educational opportunities to young African Americans. Members of the organization have taught Caston’s daughters how to plant seeds and grow a garden. In previous summers, mentors with the program also took children in the camp to see the home of Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist and organizer who was assassinated at his home in 1963. Longtime Jackson residents whose children participate in the Mississippi Urban League’s summer programs said they weren’t aware the programs existed. By the time some learned about it, the programs were full. Capacity is an issue, but the Urban League helps the number of children it can. Burt says that if it weren’t for the program, dozens of kids would go hungry and would spend the summer months sitting at home, unsupervised, while their parents work. “We are lucky to offer all of the programming that we do,” she says. “It makes a huge difference in the lives of children.” In Atlanta, Radcliffe Presbyterian Church members have spent the past five years trying to address food insecurity in their community. Beginning in 2014, the church partnered with other congregations and organizations to serve dinner to families in need at a local apartment complex. A year later, Radcliffe began working with Georgia Nutritional Services, which receives USDA funds, to offer summertime lunches to children in the area. This means that each day, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., children under 18 from all over Atlanta can go to the church for lunch. After they eat, they can also play games and work on arts and crafts. Iris Wallace has been a member of Radcliffe for 25 years and assists with much of the food programming, including a “backpack program” during the school year that provides children with shelf-stable food items to take home in their backpacks for the weekend. These programs were born out of necessity, Wallace says.

When the church launched its food programs, the USDA reported that almost 25 percent of the children in metropolitan Atlanta were considered food insecure. Now, about 25 children use the summer lunch program at Radcliffe. Although some are from surrounding neighborhoods, most of the children are picked up by church vans from nearby apartment complexes. If more families dropped in for food or expressed interest in having their children picked up, Wallace says, they would expand the program to meet the needs of the community. As the kids file in the church’s door, Wallace and other members of the congregation greet the children and ask them how they’re doing. They want to establish a relationship with all of the children, and to let them know they are cared for. Doing this is just as important as the food, she says. While Radcliffe’s summer lunch program doesn’t require children to be members of the church or identify as any particular faith, the church uses Luke 14:12-14 as the “guidepost” for its lunch program, Wallace explained. “This [Bible verse] says that when you host a meal, you don’t invite your friends or your relatives or rich neighbors so that they will in turn invite you and you will be repaid. Instead, when you give a meal, you invite the poor… and you will be blessed,” Wallace said. “We are filling these food gaps, and it doesn’t matter what color you are, what language you speak, none of that matters. If you’re a child who is hungry, we will feed you.”

At the peak of the coronavirus pandemic this spring, Sharawn Vinson often woke up crying. A recurring thought was making the unemployed single mother desperate: that her kids could go hungry.

There was also fear of contracting the virus, which has disproportionately hit low-income Black families like hers. Meanwhile, some of the largest protests against racial injustice in decades were transpiring right outside their window, after the family had experienced its own terrifying encounter with police earlier in the year. There were unpaid bills, and feelings of shame from having to go to a soup kitchen in search of a meal.

So Vinson made the painful decision to send 11-year-old twins Mason and Maddison to live with their father, six states to the south, knowing that way they’d at least be fed.

DAILY TOP BROOKLYN NEWS News for those who live, work and play in Brooklyn and beyond Leave this field empty if you're human:

“I needed them to breathe,” Vinson said, wiping away tears in her living room of peeling gray walls in a Brooklyn housing development.

Vinson was not alone in struggling to put food on the table in this historically tumultuous year. In New York City alone, an estimated 2 million residents are facing food insecurity, a number that the city’s mayor estimates nearly doubled in the pandemic amid the biggest surge in unemployment since the Great Depression. The scope of the problem outstrips previous crises such as the Great Recession, according to those who are working to combat it, and it’s not going away anytime soon.

“It’s never been this tragic for such a sustained period of time. Since COVID hit, the numbers of people in line at food pantries and soup kitchens skyrocketed, and it’s not going down,” said Rosanna Robbins, director of food access and capacity at City Harvest, the city’s biggest food rescue organization. “And so I think for us it’s just adjusting to the fact that we expect there to be a real need for free food for a very long time to come.”

When New York schools closed in March, Vinson’s children lost overnight the free breakfasts and lunches they relied on in normal times. Grocery store shelves were poorly stocked, and her pantry was almost bare. She began skipping meals to make sure the children ate, and having them wake up later to try to trick hunger by giving them two meals a day instead of three.

“You never realize how important schools are until you don’t have them,” Vinson said.

-->

“I’d open the refrigerator and I’d see struggle,” she added, “and also sacrifice.”

Oldest daughter Jasmin, 25, and 5-year-old grandson Hunter were living at a homeless shelter but came to visit her at the Lafayette Gardens public housing complex, where the family would share whatever they could scrape together for lunch.

“It got to the point where the kids would unconsciously save a chicken wing for Hunter,” Vinson said.

The family was cooped up for weeks during lockdown, living on just $1,800 a month in worker’s compensation from an on-the-job injury Vinson suffered last year when she fell and tore her meniscus.

From the dusty kitchen window of their 16th-floor apartment, they could see the deserted basketball court, slides and monkey bars at the Classon Playground, closed due to the pandemic.

As she tried to stretch meals of spaghetti and frozen burgers, the kids would argue over everything from who got to control the TV remote to who got the last snack. “Everybody was depressed, angry,” Vinson said.

Vinson was no stranger to hunger, having been raised in poverty by her mom, also a single mother. Vinson had the first of her six children at age 18 and recalls struggling to pay for diapers and food. But from her mother she learned values that have helped sustain her in difficult times, such as grit and generosity.

She took comfort in prayer and gospel music. One song in particular spoke to her: Melvin Crispel III’s “Not the End of Your Story.”

“I know that this is just not it,” she said of getting through the pandemic. “There’s more, there’s something, it’s not the end.”

Across the city, lines at pantries stretched for blocks. Social distancing was complicating food distribution efforts, and many pantries lost older volunteers who stayed home due to high risk of severe effects of COVID-19. A network of churches, volunteers, city government offices, restaurants and immigrant centers stepped in to fill the void.

In May, Vinson saw a Facebook post seeking volunteers for a pantry run by a restaurant owner and a Baptist church, providing hundreds of meals to people in need along with notes bearing inspirational prayers or good wishes such as “What doesn’t kill you will build you.”

“I said, you know what? That’s something that’s up my alley,” said Vinson, whose job before injury and the pandemic was at a shelter for people with mental illnesses and chemical addictions.

Vinson also felt she could set an example for her children. She began bringing Jasmin and the twins to help distribute the food as fellow volunteers, helping teach them values she got from her own mother. It was also a way to make sure her kids got at least one meal a day, from the pantry.

Things seemed to be looking up, but protests and clashes sparked by the police killing of George Floyd raised haunting memories of the incident from earlier in the year when police stormed the apartment building searching for a shooting suspect and pointed their guns at Mason as he was cleaning the litter for his cat, Shadow.

It traumatized the boy and made him angry at police, she said. One day this summer, as she sat outside watching the latest protest, a neighbor called out her name. Across the street, Mason was jumping up and down on top of a patrol car. Vinson ran over.

“And when I grabbed him and I went to chastise him, I was at a loss for words, because how do I tell you not to be angry when four of their brothers in blue had guns to your head?” she said. “How do I tell you not to retaliate?”

Soon after, she called her ex-partner in North Carolina, and on June 4 the twins headed south.

Living without them was hard, she said, but it bought her time to stabilize her ability to provide for them. She saved up food stamps and some money, and found a job working for the 2020 U.S. Census.

One day she asked the restaurant owner who ran the pantry if she could bring back some trays for her housing complex. That effort has since grown to dozens of meals plus groceries and protective face masks that she and other volunteers distribute each Saturday.

The twins finally came home in August, in time for Maddison to celebrate her remote graduation from middle school along with friends and family and for Mason to take part in the first practice of the Brooklyn United Youth Football season.

The police department apologized for the incident involving Mason and hosted him and a group of other kids and their families to discuss their concerns over pizza and chicken wings with high-ranking officers.

“These kids have been enduring a lot in the last couple of months, from the COVID wave to the Black Lives Matter, to the protesters, to the police brutality,” Vinson said. “And not too many times people stop and ask, how do they feel?”

The coronavirus outbreak has slowed significantly in New York compared with earlier this year. But times remain tough: Their rent is four months overdue, and the cable is about to be cut off. On a recent day the bathroom flooded, sending water running through the halls.

Still, Vinson feels fortunate.

“There’s so many people who are out here who are hungry,” she said. “I got my grandson, I got my kids and I got my life. What do I got to complain about?”

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food. Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an “unlimited” meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal “swipes” didn’t roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).”

Glasper isn’t alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

“Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,” said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and the The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State’s operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

But contractors eventually ran out of “ways to distinguish themselves on the service side” when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

“Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it.” — Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12% commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn’t reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a “campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations, and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan “is much, much more expensive” than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won’t use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,” Mac Dermott said of meal options. “They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a “food-court environment” where managers can “interchange menu concepts very easily,” said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands, such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.”

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into an “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

“Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,” said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. “They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they’re going to have access to (at home).”

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but “we’ve adjusted” to student demand. “Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there’s going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the “Ultimate” plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren’t using the rising prices to “pad the pocket of the institution.” She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshman are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 “Rebel Unlimited Plus 1” plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract “to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,” said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar “Dining Dollars” food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama’s contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid, such as Pell Grants, don’t always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,” Grant said. “But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefit packages, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there…” Eventually, it was “ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.” — Joshua Taylor, former Ole Miss athletics cook

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks, impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,” Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017. “I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,” he said. “We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

These stories ask questions about worker compensation and benefits, university revenue models, and the relationship between universities and the corporate food service provider Aramark. On October 25, during the Southern Foodways Symposium on the University of Mississippi campus, reporters from the project will discuss their findings.

More than a dozen states have programs to link farmers with food banks, and many have scaled up efforts in response to the pandemic. Elaine Thompson/The Associated Press

Read Stateline coverage of the latest state action on coronavirus.

Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify the California Department of Food and Agriculture's role in the Farm to Family program.

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a longstanding initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and supported by the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

“All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,” said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. “When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.”

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts Quick View Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts A U.S.-China trade deal is falling short on its commitments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don’t have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic’s early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

“If food banks can’t take more product [from the California program], farmers are going to go out of business,” Linkhart said. “That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.”

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

“That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,” said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. “It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.”

Raudabaugh said the state’s dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers’ distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don’t make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

“We’re providing many hundreds of percents more [to food banks] than pre-pandemic,” Raudabaugh said. “Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these [partnerships]. It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.”

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

“The money has to be there to justify the harvest,” Michael said, “and this solves some of that problem.”

Washington’s Work

On Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen’s small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers’ pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

“It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,” Van Laanen said. “It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.”

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he’s already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi’s Farm stay afloat.

“It was really timely,” Chichester said. “It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early timeframe.”

Karen Affeld, the development group’s executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

“Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,” she said. “That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.”

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state’s Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California’s that launched in 2014.

It’s a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they’re harvesting crops bound for food banks.

“Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,” said David Bobanick, the group’s executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another four pounds are donated by farmers.

“Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,” he said. “It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.”

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

“Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,” said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets’ food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she’s heard from parents who couldn’t otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

Making Connections

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture — known as CSA — in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program’s website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

“You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,” said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. “People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.”

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

“We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,” Lebeaux said. “Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.”

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

“We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,” said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. “One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.”

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

“If there’s one silver lining,” she said, “it’s that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.”","And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—The MSU Community Garden is kicking off its first official season today [Oct. 15], holding a ribbon cutting ceremony that also marks the beginning of Green Week on campus.

Administrators, faculty and students gathered to celebrate the garden’s opening, with Green Week activities including a stream clean-up, recycling sort, sustainability fair and more.

MSU President Mark E. Keenum discussed how the garden forwards the university’s mission of helping feed the world while serving as an illustration of the three pillars of the land-grant institution—learning, research and service.

“The MSU Community Garden exemplifies Mississippi State University’s commitment to solving one of the world’s greatest challenges—food insecurity,” Keenum said. “This garden will serve as a valuable resource for students, faculty and staff as they grow healthy food and conduct research and outreach, all of which will contribute to our overall efforts to eradicate hunger wherever it exists, whether that’s here at home in the local community or in communities around the world.”

A former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Keenum has made global hunger a priority since returning to Mississippi State as president in 2009. Earlier this year, he was appointed chairman of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development. He also is chairman of the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research Board of Directors.

George Hopper, dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, emphasized during the ceremony the garden’s important role as a living classroom for MSU students.

“The MSU Community Garden provides an excellent opportunity for our students to be involved in food production at the local level. We are always looking for opportunities to train them and impart necessary life skills,” Hopper said. “This not only teaches valuable life lessons but encourages students to be ambassadors for agriculture locally, nationally and globally.”

Angi Elsea Bourgeois, dean and professor in MSU’s College of Architecture, Art and Design, said the garden gives students a chance to make a positive and lasting impact on the university community.

“This opportunity for cross-college collaboration creates a beautiful and meaningful impact on the Mississippi State community,” Bourgeois said. “Not only does the garden itself provide a place for students across campus to experience community while engaging in micro-gardening, it also provides our students in both CAAD and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences a chance to use their shared expertise in design to create a positive lasting mark for future students.”

Spearheaded by Cory Gallo, associate professor of landscape architecture, the garden is located adjacent to the EPA raingarden at the landscape architecture complex on Stone Boulevard. The garden includes eight accessible planters and 19 large raised planters. Approximately 50 students, faculty and staff were selected as the first gardeners earlier this fall on a first come, first served basis and now manage beds flush with a mix of fall produce.

Additionally, the space serves as an outdoor laboratory for sustainable/healthy food courses on campus and as a research site for the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station. The garden also includes two autonomous farming robots, or “Farmbots,” operated by the Students for Sustainable Campus organization. Each Farmbot maintains its own 5’ by 10’ bed. Two 2,000 gallon cisterns harvest rain water and condensation from a nearby air conditioning unit, and compost for use in the garden is collected from dining halls and Campus Landscape.

The garden is a cross-campus collaboration between several academic entities, two administrative units and three student organizations. Student organizations include MSU Student Association, MSU Graduate Student Association and Students for a Sustainable Campus. Academic units include the departments of Landscape Architecture; Plant and Soil Sciences; Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion; Art (graphic design concentration); Building Construction Science and the School of Architecture. Administrative units include the Office of Planning Design and Construction Administration and the Department of Health Promotion and Wellness. Additionally, MSU Facilities Management and the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station volunteered their time and expertise while the MSU Extension Service contributed funds.

About 13% of Americans, or 27.4 million people, reported they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat on a weekly basis, according to the latest Household Pulse Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 16. About 14 million households with children report not having enough to eat.

It's a situation lawmakers hope to improve. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a hunger crisis that has touched every part of our nation,"" Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry said in a statement Sunday. ""I am relieved that help is on the way and I look forward to continuing to do more in the new year to help Americans through this continuing crisis.""

Sunday's funding deal includes a 15% increase to the maximum SNAP benefits for six months through June 30, 2021, a move that many advocates were calling for. The increase amounts to a boost of about $25 per person each month.

The average SNAP benefit per person was $125 per month during the fiscal year 2020, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's about $1.39 per person per meal.

Roughly 6 to 7 million more people have applied and been approved for SNAP benefits since February, according to available data analyzed by CBPP. Nationally, that's about a 17% increase. About 25.3 million Americans total reported currently receiving SNAP benefits in the latest Census Household Pulse survey.

The latest relief package also expands SNAP eligibility to college students and excludes unemployment benefits from being counted as income when it comes to SNAP benefits. Additionally, U.S. territories including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa — which are not eligible for SNAP — will receive $614 million for nutrition grants.

The bill will also expand food access for children, including allowing any child under 6 to be deemed ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits under the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program. The program provides families with a voucher to purchase groceries to replace the breakfasts and lunches their children miss when schools and child-care centers are closed or only offering remote learning.

Congress reauthorized the program on Oct. 1, but it took the U.S. Department of Agriculture six weeks to establish the new guidelines for the program, meaning that states only started applying for funds this month.

Under the latest bipartisan deal, food banks also will receive $400 million in funding through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, will receive $175 million.

""Our network of member food banks across the country are witnessing unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for charitable food assistance,"" Kate Leone, Feeding America's chief government relations officer, said in a statement last week. ""Families are making impossible decisions between paying the rent and putting food on the table while food banks are working tirelessly to keep up with the increased need.""

The $13 billion in funding would provide ""limited but immediate help,"" Leone said, adding that more federal funding and assistance would likely be needed in the future. ""As always, and especially during this crisis, the simple truth is that charity alone cannot solve food insecurity.""

90,"Oct 1, 2020",HubcitySPOKES.com,Extra Table kicks off Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge to feed Mississippians,"With the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, Extra Table – a Hattiesburg nonprofit organization that works with a variety of food distributors and brokers to provide nutritious meals to food pantries around Mississippi – has scrapped its calendar of events for 2020 and replaced them with the Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge, a football-related fundraising competition designed to ensure Mississippians have food throughout the fall and into 2021.

The launch of the virtual fundraiser, which will feature various initiatives during the next two months, was announced Oct. 1 during a news conference at the University of Southern Mississippi.

“It’s something that we hoped to do four or five years ago, and finally this year, it came together,” Extra Table founder Robert St. John said. “People are very aware of hunger problems around Thanksgiving and Christmas, but people in this condition are just as hungry in July and September and October as they are in November and December.

“We raised a good bit of money over this last quarter, but we’re going to stretch that out to where these agencies that we serve don’t run out of food in June or July, when people are just as hungry then.”

During the Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge, which will end Thanksgiving weekend, participants can take place in a variety of events, including the The Yolks On You social media challenge. The Yolks On You, which is similar to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, challenges individuals to donate to Extra Table and crack an egg on their head after nominating three people to do the same on camera.

Participants are asked to upload their video to social media and tag Extra Table in their posts.

“Get ready for that,” said Rhonda Hayden, director of development at Extra Table. “We’re going to need lots of people to do videos with their friends and family, and post it on Facebook and tag Extra Table.”

There’s also Helmets for Hunger, in which eight famous Mississippi artists will decorate helmets for an upcoming silent auction, and a Text to Give Campaign that will allow participants to donate on the Tackle Hunger website. Every dollar donated will count toward the participant’s favorite college football team in Mississippi.

Another initiative is Real Men Tackle Hunger, in which a group of 25 professional men across the state will conduct their own fundraising for Extra Table.

“That will take place on social media platforms and individual letters to their friends and family,” Hayden said. “As a part of this distinguished group of community leaders, the Real Men Tackling Hunger are not only raising funds for Extra Table’s statewide feeding efforts, but raising awareness of food insecurity in our state.”

Extra Table also will work with Stokes Distributing and Coca-Cola to set up tear sheets for $1 at convenience stores, grocery stores and other businesses statewide. The organizations will donate a small percentage of sales from Coca-Cola case products that are bought during October and November. The tear sheets will be in the shape of a football and feature Extra Table’s logo, and purchasers will be asked to write their name on the football for display in the store.

“We chose the price point of one dollar, since one dollar provides 5.9 healthy meals,” Hayden said. “So no matter how small your donation to Extra Table may be, it will feed our hungry neighbors in Mississippi and make a positive impact on the fight against hunger.”

Anyone interested in taking part in the Tackle Hunger Giving challenge can visit www.extratable.org or visit any of the organization’s social media platforms.

“We are looking to make this an annual event,” Hayden said. “I think the partners that we have in place for this first year are really rooting for us to take this on an annual basis.”

Fifteen college athletic programs across the state – including Southern Miss, Mississippi State University and Ole Miss – will challenge fans, staff, faculty, alumni and students to raise money during the Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge. A grand trophy will be given to the fanbase that raises the most funds.

“It started out as kind of a rivalry thing between Mississippi State and Ole Miss, and then other people brought USM in,” St. John said. “Then others kind of heard about it and started hopping on the bandwagon, so now we have 15 college athletic programs that are going to join in. It’s a good competition for a great cause.”

The First – A National Banking Association will serve as the title sponsor for the fundraiser, while the Mapp Family Foundation will serve as the match sponsor.

“Of course, we’re headquartered here, and as we’ve grown to Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia, we definitely realized Hattiesburg is home, and even the state of Mississippi is home,” said Jerome Brown, executive vice president at The First – A National Banking Association. “So us taking care of home is always important.

“When we think about tackling hunger and combining it with football, it’s just a win-win for everyone. We’re privileged to be a part of this.”","“It’s something that we hoped to do four or five years ago, and finally this year, it came together,” Extra Table founder Robert St. John said.

93,"Sep 27, 2020",Arkansas Online,Pandemic has fewer kids getting meals at schools,"In a state where many children didn't get enough to eat before the pandemic, changes to kindergarten-through-12th-grade education threaten to widen the hunger divide.

Participation in school meal programs -- a linchpin in children's nutrition, especially for those who get free or reduced-price lunches -- has dropped in many districts around the state this fall, administrators say.

That's true even though most districts opted in on a federal program that allows all students to eat at no out-of-pocket costs through December.

More than half of Arkansas' schoolchildren are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, so missed lunches and breakfasts indicate potential gaps in access to food as schools move to feed the kids in new ways. Missed meals are also troubling indicators, experts say, amid an upswing in nationwide food insecurity tied to this year's economic recession.

[Gallery not loading above? Click here for more photos » arkansasonline.com/927meals/]

In Arkansas and elsewhere, the recession-tied burden weighs most heavily on Black, Hispanic and other children of color and their families, experts and advocates say.

""Anywhere there's a hungry child, I can guarantee you there's an entire hungry family"" because parents will go without to make sure their kids are fed, said Arkansas Food Bank Chief Executive Officer Rhonda Sanders. ""I think most people tend to forget that.""

Since schools reopened in August, just a fraction of families who chose to have their children attend classes virtually are going to school to pick up breakfasts and lunches, officials say. Also, the number of students getting their meals in school cafeterias is down, attributed to safety fears unassuaged by extra cleaning and food-packaging measures.

In the Pocahontas School District, about 300 students chose all-virtual learning this fall, and child nutrition director Patty Moore said she is sending food home for approximately 30 of them each week. That can mean the district will receive less in reimbursements for meals served, she said, and saddle families with the extra food costs.

Even if families in the area are among a recent surge in state applicants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) -- a successor to the food stamp program -- ""I know it's costing more for them to [feed kids at home] than if their kids come to school and eat,"" Moore said.

The same situation is evident among remote learners in the Fort Smith and North Little Rock school districts. In the latter, a spokesman estimated that fewer than 25% of the district's virtual learners are going to schools to get their meals, and acknowledged that ""transportation might be an issue.""

The Arkansas Department of Education isn't tracking specific data on meals distributed to virtual learners, but the agency's Child Nutrition Unit has fielded calls from administrators concerned about meal participation this school year, spokeswoman Kim Mundell wrote in an email.

Accounts from districts overall point to children eating less frequently at school and having less access to food since the spring pandemic community lockdowns.

In May, one national survey found that four in 10 adults with children eligible for free and reduced-price lunches weren't getting replacement assistance, said food insecurity expert Elaine Waxman.

Across the country, news reports this summer documented long lines of cars and unprecedented demand at food banks as millions of people lost jobs and businesses closed because of the pandemic.

Waxman, who is a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank The Urban Institute, said this fall's reports of fewer children eating school-provided meals ""doesn't surprise"" her and ""is probably not an indication that families don't need the help -- just that the logistics may work against participation.""

Jeremy Everett, founder and executive director of the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, said he has heard a few similar concerns about lower school meals participation, though it's not enough to know if the situation is nationwide.

""Many of the children are at home alone while their parents work and are unable to leave to go get their meals,"" he said in an email.

""It seems that the primary barrier is transportation. Children and parents are having a difficult time getting to the meals to pick them up when available, and schools do not have the capacity to make home deliveries.""

The end of many coronavirus relief programs, such as the weekly $600 unemployment insurance supplement that expired in July, coupled with sporadic or skipped meals offered through schools undermine efforts to keep kids from going hungry.

Those efforts, which experts and officials view as successful, include many districts opting in on a U.S. Department of Agriculture waiver that allows districts to serve children free lunches even if the family's income is higher than the usually limit. The program will cover about $80 million in costs through December, state Education Secretary Johnny Key said at a Sept. 2 media briefing.

The initiative will reduce administrative burdens at schools, as well as worry for families who ""might not qualify for free meals, but are still going through a tough time,"" Key said.

Melanie Hyso, 42, of Bentonville said efforts by state and federal governments this year helped her feed her 16-year-old, 12-year-old and 7-year-old. She praised the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) assistance program, which federal legislation created in March. It offered $319 per child for families eligible for free or reduced-price lunches because schools had closed.

Hyso said she's ""so grateful' for the assistance card, which arrived later than she'd expected, during the costly run-up to the fall semester.

""You're trying to get supplies, and clothes, and shoes, and all this stuff, and I'm like, 'oh my god, where is it?'"" she said.

While schools were shut down in the spring and summer, her district delivered basic meals -- corn dogs, sandwiches, vegetable sticks -- to the family's house. Her son's mentor and a therapist sometimes chipped in to help, at one point dropping off a birthday cake, she said.

All of it, she said, helped during a period of budgets strained by the kids spending more time at home, using more electricity to run their learning devices or eating lunch at home rather than at school.

""We've gotten really good at getting creative,"" she said.

'GRAB AND GO'

Declining participation in school meal programs is the most recent challenge in feeding kids during a year administrators say is out of the ordinary and stressful, and began with the abrupt closure of schools in the state in mid-March.

The closures presented a challenge for districts trying to feed thousands of children who were no longer going to school every day, especially kids who rely on free and reduced-price school lunches and breakfasts.

That's the majority of Arkansas schoolchildren, state Department of Education data show. Of 263 districts and charter schools in Arkansas, 223 had more than half of their students participate in those meals programs in the 2019-20 school year. The Marvell-Elaine School District and the Helena/West Helena School District have more than 95% of students enrolled in meals programs.

Ally Mrachek, child nutrition director for Fayetteville Public Schools, said she ""kind of saw the writing on the wall"" and began planning before schools closed last spring, but she called the experience ""surreal"" nonetheless.

""We saw other districts across the country closing, and we weren't getting a lot of communication in our state,"" she said. ""We were driving forklifts and box trucks, and really trying to move food as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.""

By March 20, the USDA relaxed several of its rules on school nutrition programs, including those pertaining to eating in group settings, what time children must eat and prohibitions on parents picking up food.

Food banks in the state also joined in, packing emergency boxes, connecting children with commodities programs and distributing ""farm to family"" food boxes.

Common strategies for districts included facilitating meal pickup hours for families and delivering meals to community drop points or neighborhoods, officials said. But there were challenges.

For example, El Dorado School District workers packed some lunches not knowing whether families had access to refrigeration or freezers at home, said Kim Newman, the district's child nutrition director.

By summer, more rule modifications, extensions of waivers and an existing districtwide free student meals program allowed the food providers to drive into neighborhoods and feed any child they saw, she said.

""We would just roll down the windows and say, 'Hey, are you hungry? Want some lunch?'"" Newman said.

Summer food programs adapted menus to better ensure food safety, including ""more sandwich-type meals,"" because food has to be served at a certain temperature, said Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education Director Tonya Williams. She said programs for young kids shifted similarly, offering ""grab and go"" meals, though most of those programs now have reverted to their normal format.

""We're seeing a lot of people go back to work and have to be somewhere, so there's less of a need for 'grab and go' options,"" she said.

NO QUICK FIX

Food insecurity -- largely a measure of economic struggles -- is different from hunger. It means not consistently having enough money to buy food. For example, a woman who is food insecure might run out of money to buy food before payday and have to change her eating habits or cut out a meal.

It's long been a problem in Arkansas, a state with many low-income households. In 2018, the state had the nation's second-highest rate of food insecurity, behind only Mississippi, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Feeding America. The group operates six food banks in Arkansas.

Food insecurity is expected to increase this year because of the pandemic, a group of researchers from that organization found. Researchers project food insecurity rates will increase by 50% or more in Benton, Washington, Saline, Carroll, Lonoke and Faulkner counties, and grow at least 24% in every county in the state.

Experts say it can take years for a family to recover from a period of food insecurity -- similar to what was seen during the recession in 2008, when it took between seven and 10 years for households to recover.

The pandemic has thrown more than 10 million kids, whose families struggle with access to food, in turmoil this year, said Crystal FitzSimons, director of school and out-of-school programs at the Washington, D.C.,-based Food Research and Action Center.

Normally in times of economic shocks like job loss, a parent can sign up through schools for food assistance programs for their kids, but the pandemic upended that.

""We had a hunger crisis before the pandemic, and the pandemic just made it worse,"" she said. ""This was a situation where, overnight, communities had to try to figure out how to set up these feeding programs.""

Early responses from communities and the government drew praise from advocates. Those responses included boosts in unemployment benefits as facilitated by the federal Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act; $1,200 payments to many Americans; the P-EBT aid program; and relying on distribution frameworks in existing summer food programs.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

The federal government also briefly bumped up SNAP payments and waived several requirements around the program to make it easier for people to enroll, said Mary Franklin, Division of County Operations Director, which oversees the program in Arkansas.

But experts expressed concern about some limits in the response, including stalled negotiations in Congress regarding a new coronavirus relief package. Also, continued funding for the P-EBT program depends on the passage of a congressional spending bill that cleared the House on Tuesday.

In this year's unprecedented crisis, families also may encounter complex problems. For example, mixed-immigration-status families might not apply for pandemic aid that they're entitled to, fearing that it might affect their future citizenship applications, the Urban Institute's Waxman said.

""If you're already vulnerable, then the pandemic is just layered on that,"" she said.

State data bears out the rising need, with nearly 10,000 more households enrolled in SNAP in August than in April. Food banks across the state also are ""seeing increases"" in people seeking help, and a rise in food insecurity is expected, said Sanders, the food bank CEO.

""It's not going to just automatically drop back to where it was. There's too many jobs that have been lost; there's too many dollars that have been pulled out of the economy,"" she said.

FUTURE WORRIES

School lunch and breakfast programs can significantly ease a family's food budget by providing as many as 10 meals a week (and sometimes more for very low-income families) -- which is why a decline in their use is viewed as worrisome.

The goal is for children to lead healthy, productive lives, and ""that's impossible"" if they're hungry, said Melvin Clayton, race equity director for advocacy at Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. Experts link growing up in a food-insecure household with later-in-life health challenges, such as cognitive delays, asthma and other chronic illnesses.

Several Arkansas school districts -- including the large Benton, Bentonville, Fayetteville and Cabot districts -- are in counties where food insecurity is projected to increase the most while also seeing historically low rates of free and reduced-price lunch participation, suggesting a gap between what's happened in the past and what may be needed.

This year, the Education Department's child nutrition unit has recommended that schools develop community partnerships to help connect virtually-educated students with meals, and review and revise distribution plans if participation is low. Some districts have experimented with food pickup times, moving to once-weekly or evening pickups.

Meal distribution is ""costly,"" the Department of Education spokeswoman said, and there are no USDA funds available to help districts shoulder it.

The Arkansas Food Bank is establishing a handful of on-campus food pantries at schools around the state in a pilot program, and Sanders said it has prepared to shift back to assembling emergency food boxes quickly in case schools are forced to close on a large scale again.

Beyond schools, advocates support the extension and expansion of relief programs, encouraging less restrictive rules and urging community leaders to speak out against the perceived stigma of people using those programs. One rule that should be waived, they say, is Arkansas' ""asset limit"" of $2,250 on hand to qualify for SNAP aid.

For students attending school in person and eating on campus, much is changed in cafeterias and classrooms because of the pandemic. There are physical distancing measures, staggered lunch hours, and changes in how students handle food and condiments. Disposable utensils, dishes and cups are being used, but that also increases schools' costs and trash.

Across districts, food being sent home -- sometimes because of students suddenly being sent into quarantine -- is usually straightforward and child-friendly. Meal options include chicken nuggets or spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch, and cereal or string cheese for breakfast.

School officials say there's some uncertainty about what the rest of the school year will look like.

Mrachek, the Fayetteville director, said that's prompted her to try to sign up as many families as possible for free and reduced-price meals for the spring semester, even families that may not have used such programs in the past. Toward that end, the district created videos in English and Spanish to explain the applications, which schools must submit by Oct. 1.

""Families won't rebound as fast as that cutoff date [in December for USDA waiver programs]. I don't know if families will be back on their feet by then,"" she said.

95,"Mar 26, 2018",The Commercial Dispatch,‘The hungriest state in the nation’,"No state grapples with hunger, proportionally, as much as Mississippi, according to Mississippi Food Network CEO Charles Beady.

In fact, 20.8 percent of households in Mississippi are at risk of hunger, he said. That’s the highest, percentage-wise, in the country.

Beady, speaking Friday at Mississippi State University as the featured guest for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences’ Charles E. Lindley Lecture series, said the Mississippi Food Network is working with agencies across Mississippi to try to combat the state’s hunger issues. The Mississippi Food Network is the state’s only food bank associated with Feeding America, a nation-wide network of more than 200 food bank locations in almost every state.

The network has an 80,000 square foot facility in Jackson. Last year, Beady said, the Mississippi Food Network delivered more than 21.4 million pounds of food through the roughly 430 member agencies, such as churches, food pantries and other organizations that help in its mission.

While the work is impressive, it pales in comparison to some other food banks in the Feeding America Network that Beady highlighted during his talk.

For example, he said a food bank in Houston, Texas is 308,000 square feet, distributed 96 million pounds of food last year, employs about 180 people and had a $27 million budget last year.

Texas also has 16 food banks, according to a map on the Feeding America website, while Mississippi just has one.

“I’m trying to give you a comparison here,” Beady said. “We’re in a low-resource state. We’ve got $3.6 million. We’ve got 29 people who work for us. We’ve got two tractor trailers — a 24-footer and a 14-footer — that we distribute food through.”

Mississippi’s limited resources can present a problem, especially when coupled with the state’s high food insecurity. Food insecurity, Beady said, happens when someone doesn’t know when or how they’ll get their next meal.

He said that’s compounded by widespread food deserts across Mississippi. Beady said that U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food deserts as areas with a poverty rate higher than 30 percent and more than a third of the population living more than a mile from the nearest grocery store.

Food deserts are peppered across the state, according to a map based on USDA data that Beady presented during his lecture, which included southern Oktibbeha County, west and central Clay county and western Lowndes County. Almost all of Noxubee County, save Macon, is a food desert, according to the map.

“Nearly 600,000 people live in food deserts in Mississippi,” Beady said. “Food deserts don’t just exist in the Mississippi Delta. A lot of people think food deserts are in the Mississippi Delta. There are 19 census tracts in Jackson, Mississippi, our state capital, that are identified as food deserts.”

During a question-and-answer session, Beady also pointed out Mississippi’s hunger problems have, paradoxically, contributed to it being the fattest state in the nation. He said part of that is because people eat a lot of junk food, which is cheap, but unhealthy.

Helen Beady, Charles’ wife, who works with the American Heart Association, said where people live can also play a big role in their health.

“When you start to talk about food insecurity, it’s the conditions in which an individual lives,” she said. “I am from the Delta, and certainly we know that we’re the most food insecure. …ZIP codes, matter, but there’s social determinates for health. Health is where you live, where you work, where you play, where you raise your family and all that.”

Beady said hunger takes a lot of forms, but the Mississippi Food Network does what it can to combat it.

“Hunger in Mississippi has many faces,” Beady said. “Seniors, the young, struggling mothers, mothers-to-be. They’re white. They’re black. You don’t have to be poor in the traditional sense of being poor to not know how or when you might get you next meal. Losing a spouse, losing a job can put you in a situation where you need help, and that’s all part and parcel of why we exist at the Mississippi Food Network.”","No state grapples with hunger, proportionally, as much as Mississippi, according to Mississippi Food Network CEO Charles Beady.

97,"Sep 1, 2020",talkbusiness.net,Data confirms Delta region one of the hardest hit by COVID-19,"Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. One region, often cited as the most impoverished in the country according to economic metrics, the Mississippi Delta Region, has been hit particularly hard, according to data collected by the Delta Grassroots Caucus.

“The Delta continues to suffer seriously from the pandemic and a strong recovery is still not here. A collection of data from across the region indicate the need for a strong economic stimulus from federal, state and private sector sources. An overly rosy depiction of the Delta’s economy is counterproductive because we need to admit we still have a severe problem in order to solve it,” said Lee Powell, Caucus director.

Four of the top counties in Arkansas in terms of high unemployment include Chicot (13.6%), Mississippi (12.6%), Phlllips (11.8%) and Crittenden (11.6%). Craighead County (7.7%) remained the lone bright spot in terms of economic metrics in the region.

Other key findings from the compilation include:

Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana had the four highest rates of food insecurity based on a Feeding America survey. The Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research found the highest food insecurity levels were in Mississippi (31.6%) and Louisiana (30.1%), with Arkansas the fifth highest at 25.9%.

A survey of the University of Arkansas Department of Sociology and Criminology found that Arkansas and other Southern and mid-Southern states had elevated levels of food insecurity due to COVID-19. In the category of “reduced quality, desirability or variety of diet,” the four worst rates were all from “Greater Delta Region” states: Alabama (47.7%), Arkansas (47.4%), Tennessee (45.1%) and Kentucky (44%).

A University of Louisiana at Lafayette report found that job losses in Louisiana were virtually twice as high in the pandemic as compared with after Hurricane Katrina – by 11% in the first half of this year, as compared with a 6% drop after Katrina in 2005. Louisiana’s gross domestic product contraction of 6% was one of the five sharpest drops among all states.

An Illinois Municipal League survey found that 87% of municipalities expected a substantial revenue shortfall due to the pandemic. Many communities advised that they will need greater assistance from federal and state governments. The Southern Illinois Delta area chronically fares worse than the statewide economic figures for Illinois.

ALREADY VULNERABLE

The Delta economy was vulnerable due to many small businesses that were struggling even before the pandemic. Many have closed or have not come back yet, and many low-income people who did not have large savings to see them through a downturn are struggling financially, the data reflects.

The region’s diverse population with many African Americans and some other minorities has been hit harder by both higher virus infection rates and more economic losses, with minority women being especially hard hit because women suffered the largest job losses and as minorities they have higher virus infection rates; and the region’s economy had major manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors that have been hit disproportionately by the recession.

Harvey Joe Sanner, president of American Ag Movement of Arkansas in Des Arc, said “the situation is bleak.”

“Our job situation is worsening. as one of our large employers in Lonoke, Remmington Arms is laying off workers… I think most people feel that our situation, both health-wise and economically, will get worse before it gets better,” Sanner said.

Millie Atkins, Delta Caucus senior adviser and veteran Delta regional advocate based in Monroe, La., said the organization will seek federal relief.

“This pandemic has shed a great light on the many economic, social and educational inequities in a number of areas where the Delta was vulnerable such as the large number of job losses, the many low-income jobs that made it difficult for people to accumulate savings that could see them through a downturn, the small business closures that have not come back yet,” she said.

Powell said the Delta Grassroots Caucus will advocate for a continuing strong stimulus package at the annual Delta conference on Oct. 13-14, 2020, which will largely be conducted by Zoom webinar due to the coronavirus. Delta Caucus partners across the region are calling for a strong economic stimulus and safety net package to jump-start the region’s economy. Suggestions for a policy package include continuing larger unemployment benefits and strong federal and state economic stimulus packages to deal with unprecedented job losses.

The Caucus will seek a 15% increase in SNAP and other nutrition benefit programs during the pandemic – although SNAP is primarily an anti-hunger program, it also has an economic stimulus impact, with every $1 spent on SNAP generating $1.70 in economic benefits. The Caucus will ask for a major infrastructure expansion program to create jobs, repair deteriorating infrastructure, and stimulate the economy.

The Caucus will seek funding for Job creation and retention programs through tax incentives for investing in economically distressed areas. It will ask for maintaining education and workforce development programs during the pandemic, which will require a major broadband access expansion initiative through programs such as USDA’s Rural Re-Connect high-speed broadband program and state programs like Arkansas’ Rural Connect (ARC).","Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The historic Covid-19 pandemic has created an increased need for donations to The University of Southern Mississippi’s Eagle’s Nest food pantry located on the Hattiesburg campus.

In response to that dilemma, a trio of University organizations – Sigma Alpha Lambda, Association of Office Professionals and Staff Council – united to generate awareness of the pantry’s plight. Over the past several months, the groups have become directly involved in collecting and delivering contributions for the pantry.

“We could not have maintained the pantry operations without the assistance of these organizations,” said Eagle’s Nest Adviser Dr. Tamara Hurst, associate professor in USM’s School of Social Work. “They worked with us throughout the summer and into the fall. Members worked in the pantry and delivered food to students who were unable to come to campus. The pantry relies on community support and volunteers to stay open. It means everything to us to receive this support.”

Located in the basement of The Hub on the Hattiesburg campus, The Eagle’s Nest provides food, hygiene items, school supplies and other assorted products to students and staff. Only a current Southern Miss identification card is needed to access the pantry.

Hurst notes that the pantry’s primary needs include shelf-stable items such as dried or canned beans, rice, fruits, vegetables and meats.

“We always welcome fresh fruits, vegetables and bread,” said Hurst. “Gently-used cookware and eating utensils are always in demand, particularly with student in off-campus apartments.”

Since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted across the country in March, the Eagle’s Nest has experienced an increased demand from staff and international students, in particular. Jennifer Lewis, Assistant Director of Compliance and Ethics at USM, serves as the Vice President for Community Service for Sigma Alpha Lambda. She is also an Eagle’s Nest board member. Lewis says the relentless pandemic has produced immense strain on charity venues such as the Eagle’s Nest.

“In these unprecedented times, we are concerned that our most vulnerable populations, i.e. some of our staff whose spouses may not have been able to return to work or missed work during earlier quarantine phases are playing catch-up and our students, especially our international students who cannot work off-campus continue to suffer from food insecurity due to the period of time during which they were not able to work on campus,” said Lewis.

Collection bins have been placed on the Hattiesburg and Gulf Park campuses at the following locations.

100,"Sep 24, 2020",ELLE.com,There Is No Vaccine For America's Hunger Crisis,"This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has sent the number of hungry Americans skyrocketing. The rate of food insecurity is expected to rise at least 12.5 percent from 2018, while the number of food insecure people might rise by a minimum of 40.5 million, according to statistic from Feeding America, which is working across the country to address the need.



Mamie Cain is a Feeding America volunteer, working in Fayette, Mississippi. She started the Pine Grove Baptist Church Helping Hands, a group that aids the community and partners with the Mississippi Food Network, the local Feeding America food bank. Cain, who is a prison case manager, has been working tirelessly through the epidemic, taking time off only to grieve a personal COVID loss. She spoke to ELLE.com about what the need looks like up close, taking shame out of the equation, and working through the uncertainty of the pandemic.

We've been involved in helping the community and involved with the Feeding America program since, I believe, 2004. My husband, who is deceased now, and I learned about it through the Veterans programs that were doing food programs at that time. We got interested, and worked with our board in order to do it for our church.

It's been good ever since that time. We've been working together, raising funds and helping the community—it's just something that we like doing. We have this slogan, ""It's in our hearts."" We have great support with the Mississippi Food Network, the Feeding America food bank. We've been working with them for a long time, they provide us with professional and courteous service.

""We all go through things in one time or the other.""

We all go through things in one time or the other. During this COVID period, we all need a little bit more of a helping hand because so many people are losing their jobs. We do have a few more calls, and a few more people just show up. We assist them during this time without question. We don't need to be questioning peoples' needs—we try to assist as much as we can, when we can. We continue to raise funds on our own to add to whatever we acquire from the food bank. And we've tried, on our own, to raise funds to get more. We do well, and our community works with us, which enables us to move forward.

We try to stay open periodically during the day, a couple of hours. We have great assistants, a great volunteer group of people that help us out and keep the food bank open on specific hours and days. My phone number is available. If people contact us, we will go open it at any time. Most available times are from eight to five. If it's after five o'clock, they know they can call me. Sometimes the staff will even deliver foods.

Courtesy Feeding America

We have first-time people come in, we introduce to them what we're about, and then we introduce the process on how we handle the food, and the application process if they want to continue. Most of them do come back and complete the application process. Sometimes they refer others to come to us for assistance, and the process continues. We talk to our people, and we work with our people in a good way, I feel. Conversation is always good, it puts people's minds at ease.

Our busiest period was April through June. We started to slow down a little bit in July. I think we are stable right now. In August we’d serve over 200 in a week. When we get extra food, we can serve over 300 to 400 a week and also help our neighboring pantries.

""We all had deaths in our families because of COVID, but we continued to serve.""

During the high point, we all were very, very concerned, and we had to live by the Food Network (COVID-19) rules of social distance and wearing masks. Because we had to be protective of our families and protective of their families. We all were very concerned, it was iffy. We just followed those guidelines and everything went well. Although myself, our volunteers and my staff, we all had deaths in our families because of COVID, we continued to serve.

We still continue to serve the community. We had to slow down a little bit for a while there when we did have the deaths in our family—we had problems, too. But we made sure that our people were taken care of, made sure that at the end of the day we had enough or could refer them to other pantries.

Courtesy Feeding America

During this process, people talk about the loss of their jobs or problems, having enough to pay their bills. They encourage us because they'll tell us many times that the food that they get from us helps a long ways. We are all appreciative—when people say things like that it motivates you to continue to serve. My family and volunteers that assist, they do not waver. Even though we all are scared of this COVID, they do not waver. We all continue to work with the Network to assist the public.

What I’ve found is that it's a good feeling to help. When a family comes to a food bank it's a necessity. If we have it, they have it, too. We are in this together, and we will work together to help each other.

As told to Adrienne Gaffney.

101,"Apr 26, 2020",Ole Miss News,North Mississippi VISTA Project Seeks Applicants to Serve Communities,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – As physical distancing to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has transformed the way that Mississippians go to school, do business and care for their neighbors, the North Mississippi VISTA Project is seeking applicants to join efforts to fight poverty in Mississippi through national service.

The North Mississippi VISTA Project has positions for full-time service for summer and yearlong terms of service beginning in June 2020. VISTA members join nonprofit organizations and Title I school districts to support educational attainment, economic opportunity and healthy lifestyles.

While the country practices physical distancing, VISTA members are permitted to support the mission of their host sites through teleservice.

“Already we have seen members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project come forward to support relief efforts in the face of COVID-19,” said Emily Echols, project manager with the University of Mississippi‘s McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement, which leads the North Mississippi VISTA Project.

“From fundraising campaigns to offset the loss of income to working with school districts to deliver school lunches to students living in isolated areas, VISTA members are making a difference for those most at risk of suffering income loss and food insecurity.”

Natural disasters and crises throw the most vulnerable members of society into even more precarious situations. Disparities in income, health status and access to healthy food become more pronounced in emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In such unprecedented times, efforts to alleviate poverty, empower communities and create sustainable solutions are more urgent than ever.

“While VISTA members make a difference at their host sites by increasing the reach of the organization, collectively all members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project are building a better Mississippi,” said Adriana Cooper, VISTA leader. “My time as a VISTA member has permitted me to develop my professional skills while serving my community.”

The North Mississippi VISTA Project needs applicants for summer and full-year terms of service. VISTA summer associates complete 300 hours of direct service to promote literacy and food security over the summer. VISTA members serving yearlong terms help host site organizations by writing grants, developing programs, conducting outreach, managing volunteers and strengthening partnerships.

All VISTA members receive a living allowance of approximately $950 per month and can select either an end-of-service education award of $6,195 ($1,311 for summer associates) or a cash stipend of $1,800 ($311 for summer associates). Members serving a yearlong term also are eligible for a health benefit, a child care benefit and a housing stipend, if offered by their host sites.

“The North Mississippi VISTA Project is central to the McLean Institute’s mission to fight poverty through education in Mississippi,” said Albert Nylander, McLean Institute director and professor of sociology. “Our work is needed now more than ever.”

102,"Jun 29, 2020",National Hog Farmer,"CAST releases report on COVID-19 impact on food, agricultural markets","The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology and the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association have partnered together on a new paper, Economic Impacts of COVID-19 on Food and Agricultural Markets. This publication contains insights from 31 experts and is now available for download.

COVID-19 disrupted nations around the world in 2020. People have had to alter their typical lifestyle, and the measures put into effect to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have had an immense impact on economic activity, employment, food consumption and workplace environments.

The paper's authors discuss the following topics: macroeconomics, trade, supply chain, consumer behavior, food service/grocery, meat processing, forestry and wood products, local food systems, food waste, food insecurity, major commodity crops, agricultural finance, agricultural labor, rural health care, and research and outreach priorities.

Keith Coble, the department head for agricultural economics at Mississippi State University, says, ""Between food producers and consumers lies a complex and often-ignored food supply chain. It is ignored in part because it has consistently provided safe and plentiful food supplies."" Most of the time people's attention is on food-borne illnesses instead of looking at shutdowns that could affect the labor supply.

""The COVID-19 crisis has also shown us the danger of disregarding scientific knowledge. There is a need to reassess the regulation of new technologies in the United States and globally,"" says David Zilberman, a professor in the agricultural and resource economics department at the University of California, Berkeley.

Many countries shut down large segments of their economies, with most employees working remotely if possible. Doing so ""led to a sharp and significant loss in gross domestic product and a rapid rise in unemployment and underemployment,"" says Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Georgia. ""The challenge is to restore as much economic activity as possible while maintaining some measure of control and mitigation of the novel coronavirus.""

103,"Oct 6, 2020",NBC News,This is what hunger looks like in COVID-19 America,"Corina Martinez never expected to find herself in a food bank line.

As a customer service representative for a financial institution in El Paso, Texas, Martinez is usually able to feed her three kids with the help of free school meals. But when the government shut down schools in March as a result of COVID-19, she was out of options.

“It’s terrible to say this, but before, I used to think ‘Oh my God, going to a food bank is so embarrassing, I’m not going,” Martinez, 34, said in an interview with Know Your Value. “Now, I just go.”

Corina Martinez with her husband, Edgar, and their three children, Darren, 15, Natalie, 13, and Caleb, 2. Courtesy of Corina Martinez.

These days, Martinez pops over to the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Food Bank when she can. She waits in line in her car, and when it’s her turn, she browses the shelves and takes home a cart full of fresh and nutritious food. It has been a lifesaver during the global pandemic.

“You might see someone and not think that person needs it, but they might really need it,” said Martinez, who lives with her husband Edgar, who works as a delivery driver, and her kids who are 2, 13, and 15 years old. “When you really need help, it completely changes everything.”

A national hunger crisis.

Martinez is far from alone. Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, the line for the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger food bank has grown up to four miles long, according to the bank’s CEO Susan E. Goodell. By June, food distribution from the bank shot up 569 percent year-over-year.

Nationally, an analysis from Feeding America projected that food insecurity will hit 52 million people due to COVID-19, which is an increase of 17 million people from pre-pandemic times. Between March and June, it is estimated that four in 10 visitors to food banks are in need due to COVID-19-related reasons, such as school shutdowns or job loss.

“It’s an economic tradeoff,” said Feeding America’s COO Katie Fitzgerald. “You’ll pay for medicine, rent, your mortgage and your car so you can get to your job before you buy your groceries. People don’t have enough money for the food they need, so they skip meals or eat unhealthy food that’s a lot cheaper. This is what food insecurity looks like in America.”

The severity of the problem varies by state, with Mississippi facing the highest rate of projected food insecurity in 2020. Texas has the highest rate of food insecurity among minors, with 2.3 million children facing hunger in the state.

According to the Center for American Progress, women and people of color have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic across the country. Single-mother households are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience food insecurity than other households, according to Feeding America.

Struggling to keep up with demand.

Food banks are working around the clock to keep up with demand. El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, for example, is seeing an all-time low in volunteers, while donor and government funding can be unpredictable.

“It’s a constant effort to figure out how to feed 138,000 a day,” Goodell said. “We have to be very creative. It’s incredibly stressful when you come to work, and you see miles of cars of people waiting for food and you only have one-and-a-half days [worth] in the food bank.”

Food banks comply with social distancing regulations, which has led to residual issues like social isolation, according to Andrea Johnson, assistant director of the High Plains Food Bank which serves agencies along the Texas Panhandle. Many people, especially seniors, depended on the pre-pandemic food bank to express their needs verbally and interact with other people, she said. The bank also had to eliminate critical community outreach, like nutrition education classes.

“With the grab-and-go drive thru, there’s a part of the human component that we’re missing,” Johnson said.

The future looks grim. Food insecurity will not disappear once the economy recovers, Fitzgerald said. After the 2008 recession, it took about 10 years for food insecurity to drop to pre-2008 levels, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Now, the levels are climbing back up.

“Food insecurity tends to lag behind economic improvements,” said Fitzgerald. “We’re deep in responding to the needs today. But even as the economy recovers, there will be long-term elevated food insecurity until families get on their feet. It doesn’t happen overnight.”

A change in mindset toward hunger.

To help, Americans need to volunteer at their local food banks and donate whatever they can, said Goodell.

Further, the stigma surrounding aid-seekers needs to be eliminated.

“I’ve had to have kind and gentle debates with people who say that people are taking advantage of the system,” Johnson said. “Of course, we’re going to have people take advantage, but right now, we’ve got families of five who can only manage a part-time job.”

Gleaners drive-up food distribution sites--launched on March 19 in response to the increased need for emergency food due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, Gleaners continues to host 70 sites throughout our five-county service area, averaging an attendance of 255 households per site. A site above in Detroit, Michigan. Feeding America

The shame trickles down to people who actually need help, said Fitzgerald. Often, they feel like they’ve done something wrong when they’re actually victims of a crisis.

“I’ll never forget a man who lost his job in his 50s and couldn’t look me in the eye, because he used to be a donor and he couldn’t imagine needing a go to a food bank,” Fitzgerald said. “That shame is just because in America, prior to the pandemic, we faulted the person for doing something wrong. I do hope that’s changing. Food insecurity is not something that people deserve.”

Martinez advised people to ask for help without feeling embarrassed.

“Don’t be ashamed. Everybody needs that extra help once in a while,” she said. “It’s there for a reason. It’s there to help.”","These days, Martinez pops over to the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Food Bank when she can.

“We’re going to get more on Monday,” Clarke said. “You’re fine.”

All the milk was gone by Friday evening at Bully’s Closet and Pantry, a one-stop shop for food, professional clothing, school supplies and hygiene products for Mississippi State University students. It opened with a ribbon-cutting Friday morning and started distributing supplies that afternoon.

The shelves were lined with canned fruits and vegetables, beans and soup, boxes of cereal, Kleenex, personal items such as razors and deodorant and much more. Frozen meals and perishables such as milk and eggs were kept in the freezer and fridge, with a list on a white board keeping track of them.

School supplies such as pens and notebooks fill another set of shelves, and the next room in the small Morgan Avenue building contains racks lined with professional clothing, including blazers, for students to use as needed for job interviews. The building was formerly used for faculty housing, and BCP acquired the space in September 2018.

About 30 percent of college students nationwide struggle with food insecurity, so BCP will serve as “one more layer of support” for those students, MSU Vice President of Student Affairs Regina Hyatt told The Dispatch.

“We hope (the pantry) can alleviate, for the students that are most in need, some of the stress that they experience in not knowing where their next meal is coming from,” she said.

The pantry will be open from 1 to 6 p.m. on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. Students can come in once a week, and BCP provides a makeshift grocery list so they can feel like they are actually shopping, said Clarke, one of BCP’s three graduate assistant staff members.

There was “a good rush” of students when the doors first opened, Clarke said, but by 3 p.m. the shop was empty, most likely due to the stormy weather.

Hackett and Dominique Williams, both juniors, came in around 4:30 despite the downpour and filled a bag with canned soup, beans, apple juice and paper towels, among other things. When Hackett picked up bread and peanut butter and asked for jelly, Clarke made sure he and Williams were OK with the only available flavor, grape, before handing them a jar.

A group effort

Mayah Emerson knew that other Southeastern Conference universities had professional clothes closets, she said, so she included the idea in her platform when she successfully ran for president of the Mississippi State University Student Association in the spring semester of 2018.

“Students were asking about places to access professional clothing, so we really just saw it as meeting a need,” Emerson said.

The idea expanded to include a food pantry when the Office of Student Affairs got involved, she said, and her successor, current SA president Jake Manning, continued her work with the university to bring BCP to life.

Over about 18 months, BCP amassed 900 cans of vegetables, 400 cans of fruit and more than 1,000 toothbrushes and tubes of toothpaste, to name a few, said Montelleo Hobley, behavioral intervention team coordinator in the MSU Dean of Students’ Office.

A wide variety of student organizations and campus departments worked to stock the pantry, including MSU Athletics, which held drives at several football games and offered free tickets to two basketball games in exchange for donations, Hyatt said. MSU Police Chief Vance Rice asked every officer in the department to fill a box with supplies, and they did, Hyatt said.

BCP collected tax-deductible monetary donations through the MSU Foundation, which will continue to identify and pursue donors, and student organizations will help by holding food and supply drives, Hyatt said.

MSU President Mark Keenum had three words for Hyatt when she approached him with the idea for BCP: “Make it happen.”

“When we think about people who are in need of food, we tend to think about people in far-off, distant lands, but we have people in need right here in our own community, right here on our campus,” Keenum told a crowd of about 50 at Friday’s press conference.

BCP is the newest addition to MSU’s Food Security Network, which includes the Block by Block program for students to donate part of their meal plan to other students and the Maroon Meals alert system for the location and availability of food on campus.

Block by Block currently serves between 200 and 300 students, with participation increasing in recent years, Hyatt said. Faculty in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition are conducting research that will hopefully shed more light on how prevalent food insecurity is on the MSU campus, she said.

BCP will remain stocked with food items thanks to partnerships with the United Way of Central Mississippi and the Hattiesburg-based nonprofit Extra Table, as well as student and faculty donations, Hyatt said. The donation boxes in the back of the building saw several contributions Friday, Clarke said.

The staff is open to feedback on what students need that BCP does not yet have, such as shoes and a section for baby supplies. Hackett asked the staff for salt and pepper, and Clarke put it on the list of items to add.

After filling their bag, Hackett and Williams hoped to catch a bus in order to stay out of the rain on their way out of BCP Friday afternoon. Hackett, a first-semester transfer student from Hinds Community College in Raymond, said he is grateful for the pantry’s help but hopes he does not find himself using it often.

“I know there are more disadvantaged people than I am,” he said.","STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.
“You’re fine.”All the milk was gone by Friday evening at Bully’s Closet and Pantry, a one-stop shop for food, professional clothing, school supplies and hygiene products for Mississippi State University students.

105,3 weeks ago,Scott County Times,SALTER:China trade standoff resolution is critical for Mississippi farmers seeking vital markets,"Below is an opinion column by Sid Salter:

For Mississippi farmers, the transition between the administrations of former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden could not be more impactful on any topic more so than in agricultural trade with China.

China is the third leading trading partner for Mississippi exports behind Canada and Mexico, with $759 million in value in 2020 – with that number representing a 63.8 percent increase over the previous year. That grow came after 2018-2019 tariffs standoff between China and the Trump administration led to hundreds of millions in lost export revenues to Mississippi producers.

A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018. The same study found that in 2018, trade with China supported 64,000 Mississippi jobs – which highlighted the need for China to abide by the commitments under the “phase one” trade agreements.

Writing in Foreign Policy on Oct. 27, 2020, Clark Packard framed the U.S. China trade standoff succinctly: “Trump’s aggressive trade war with China took things from bad to worse for U.S. farmers. Over the course of about 18 months, Washington and Beijing engaged in a back-and-forth volley of escalating trade restrictions, including Chinese retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,000 categories of U.S. agricultural products such as pork, soybeans, dairy products, and nuts.

“In January 2020, the two sides signed a detente, but it’s only a temporary reprieve to a conflict that continues to fester and is likely to resurface in the near future. As part of the so-called phase one agreement, Beijing agreed to purchase about $32 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products over two years,” he observed.

Why should this matter to Mississippians? China’s path to superpower status is blocked most readily by their struggle to produce enough food to feed its own 1.4 billion population and also influence and alleviate regional concerns over hunger and food insecurity.

China has been able in recent years to produce rice and wheat sufficient to meet the nation’s needs, but still must import soybeans and corn as feedstuffs sufficient to satisfy the population’s growing taste for meat.

Not only is China’s massive population problematic in producing hunger and food insecurity issues, but pollution, water aquifer depletion, and the impacts of climate change are also threatening future internal abilities to feed that nation and her allies. The loyalty of regional neighbor nations dependent on food aid also remains in the balance moving forward.

In reaction to the U.S.-China trade standoff, Mississippi (along with Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska) in 2019 cut a trade deal with Taiwan for them to import about $2 billion in soybeans and corn in 2020 and 2021.

But prior to the trade war, about 80 percent of the state’s soybean production was being sold to China. Under Biden’s new Secretary of Agriculture, initial reports are that China is living up to most of its pledges on the “phase one” trade deal. That deal called for China to buy $12.5 billion in American agriculture products in 2020 and another $19.5 billion in 2021.

Vilsack blames the COVID-19 pandemic as an obstacle to China’s meeting the deal but says he’s optimistic and with apparent evidence on his side. Politico reports that U.S. farm exports are projected to hit a record $31.5 billion during Biden’s first year in office – some $4.5 billion than projected in November 2020.

Mississippi farmers producing soybeans and corn hope those projections are accurate and that Biden’s national security and trade advisors can restore American access to vital Chinese markets.

Despite global concerns over the future of shipping, trade and maritime security issues in the South China Sea, it remains advantageous for China to keep imports of food and feed grains coming to supplement what they can’t successfully produce on their own.

106,"May 31, 2020",The Guardian,'People are going to go hungry': pandemic effects could leave 54m Americans without food,"A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.

Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures.

As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year – a 63% increase compared to 2018.

Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

America’s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities.

It’s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020.

The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% – 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 – and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% – 4.8 points higher than 2018.

In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children.

Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen.

“We were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don’t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.

Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. “People are going to go hungry, that’s the truth,” said Scott.

The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year – a rise of almost 60% since 2018.

Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February.

“This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

On Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, 1,400 or so cars lined up at a mobile distribution point, which was open for three hours, for grocery boxes of canned fruits, pinto beans, pasta, milk, fresh vegetables, frozen meat and bread, to help make ends meet for a month.

Historically, there was a shortfall of 34m meals every year in the five counties served by the Community Food Bank of southern Arizona. Currently, the demand remains sky high – double pre-pandemic levels, and statewide 17% of the workforce have claimed unemployment since the start of the crisis.

“We were getting darn close to closing the meal gap before the crisis,” said Michael McDonald, the CEO. “But if demand continues at this rate for the rest of the year or into next year, we’re going to fall way short. I don’t see us being able to keep up without a longer-term commitment from the federal government.”

One in three children in Arizona could go hungry this year without food aid.

Food banks aren’t in it alone.

Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product.

In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)’s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries.

But it’s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights.

“Everything feels so unpredictable, I’ve literally no idea what’s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,” said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.

In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 – a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit. Only a tiny fraction of the USDA contracts went to distributors in New England.

As states start to reopen for business, economic recovery is expected to be painfully slow especially if further outbreaks are not adequately contained, which could trigger a full-blown second wave of the pandemic. Underemployment could last for years, which means millions of Americans are likely to need help with food, utilities and rent in the medium and long term.

Los Angeles county, where almost half the state of California’s Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, is projected to have 1.68 million food insecure people this year – the highest number in the country. It’s the most populous county in the US, with 10 million residents, where unemployment has risen to 20.3% – five percentage points higher than the state average – and food stamp applications have almost tripled compared with last year.

“If the numbers stay like this, no way food banks can cope, it’s beyond our capabilities, a lot will depend on how long federal help lasts,” said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Food Bank, which has distributed 80% more groceries since the pandemic began.

Susan King, president of Feeding Northeast Florida, agrees: “It’s when the dust settles that I’m most worried about, when the federal and state help is over but the line of people waiting for food is still long.”

King added: “This is a marathon, we can’t sugarcoat how scary it is; it absolutely keeps me up at night.”","Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

107,"Oct 29, 2019",WCBI,Some communities in Mississippi struggle with food deserts,"SHUQUALAK, Miss. (WCBI) – According to Feeding America, 1 in 5 Mississippians is struggling with hunger.

For some, grocery stores are far away, and farmer’s markets are nonexistent. But there are things communities can do to help.

Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible. In Mississippi, Dr. Kenya Cistrunk said nearly every county has pockets of desert areas.

“So when you think about Mississippi, and how rural our state is then you obviously we have to acknowledge that there are some areas that will not have access to supermarkets. How do we make sure that people who are in those areas have access to healthy food options,” said Cistrunk?

Some retailers are changing their business models – expanding into rural areas and offering some grocery options.

“Just to have something right here to grab bread, eggs, household, it means the world we are grateful to have the Dollar General here,” said Shirley Moore Blakley.

But even though these stores have some benefits, they also pose some challenges.

“When you think about someone who’s hungry and trying to get food, if I can get to Dollar General and purchase that frozen meal or the canned food at a price that works with my budget, then at least it gets me something. Where we want to get people to understand that those might not be the healthiest options and how do we help them learn those skills and techniques that they may not know, to grow their own vegetables and fruit,” said Cistrunk.

Cistrunk said it will take a broader approach to help those facing food insecurity.

“We’re talking about from a community level, not just individuals but from a community, level addressing food insecurity, through the community gardens, through the community-supported agricultural a model. Where people can purchase, you know food bags, if they have the funds or use their EBT benefits to go to the farmers market to be able to purchase the foods that they need,” said Cistrunk.

573,610 Mississippians experienced food insecurity in 2017 according to feeding America. While that number is high, it down nearly 100,000 from 2015.","- Advertisement -Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible.

It was 2009 and Edwards Street Fellowship Center in Hattiesburg was in dire straits. There were needy people who were hungry, and the food pantry had no food. Officials there didn't know what to do, so they reached out to local restaurateur Robert St. John, owner of such establishments as The Purple Parrot and Crescent City Grill. Surely, he could help.

""They were feeding about 800 people a month and they had no food on their shelves,"" St. John remembered. ""They called me in a panic.

""The quickest and easiest way (for me to get the food they needed) was for me to call my Sysco rep. That got me thinking — there was probably a way to supply these people if we applied business principals to nonprofits.""

Getting Sysco to drop ship an order wasn't as easy as St. John thought it would be. Most of the items at the world's largest food service distributor were large and institutional-sized. After a few days combing through the 15,000 items in the Sysco catalog, St. John finally put together an order and had it shipped to the pantry, just in time to make sure its clients got fed.

It was on that day that St. John's charity Extra Table was born — in concept, if not in name.

Story continues after photo gallery.

Later, St. John approached Sysco about working with him to supply food pantries and soup kitchens with food monthly. What if every business and home had an extra table where they could feed people in need, he wondered. What would that look like? He was committed to finding out.

Extra Table is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending hunger by providing food panties and soup kitchens with new, healthy food for the hungry in their communities. It serves 32 agencies in 26 counties in Mississippi, including Forrest and Lamar.

Extra Table has attracted the attention of some of Mississippi's elite. Sen. Thad Cochran's retirement dinner in Jackson on Thursday and a Mac McAnally concert at FestivalSouth in Hattiesburg Saturday are just two of the high-profile events to raise money for Extra Table.

When Extra Table raises money to buy food, all of the donations go to food purchases. And Extra Table procures only certain kinds of food with its contributions.

""I started Extra Table with two basic principals,"" St. John said. ""One hundred percent of the money we raise for food will always go to food, and the food has always got to be healthy.""

Martha Allen, Extra Table's executive director, said the food the organization provides are supplies on which agencies can rely.

""We provide healthy, shelf-stable food to pantries and food kitchens,"" Allen said. ""They eagerly await the deliveries because they are so large, and it's food they can count on — proteins, rice, beans, powdered milk. It comes every month.""

Ann McCullen, executive director of Edwards Street Fellowship Pantry, said the type of food Extra Table gives is exactly what her clients need.

""It's such a huge blessing,"" she said. ""The vegetables, the soups are sodium-free or low-sodium. If it's fruit, it's going to be packed in juice or water.

""The kind of people who come to the food pantry have diabetes or high blood pressure or both, so it's really important the food they receive is healthy.""

Extra Table delivers 3,000 pounds of food a month to Edwards Street. Last year, because of the tornado, it increased its donations, dropping off a total of 42,000 pounds of goods.

McCullen said the food feeds a wide range of people.

""We have families, we have senior citizens who live alone,"" she said. ""We have older adults who are suddenly raising grandchildren. We have young families. We have college students.

""Need knows no boundaries. Some people are with us for a season. Some are with us for a long time.""

Extra Table's services are badly needed at Edwards Street and in Mississippi. The state has the nation's largest number of documented food insecure individuals.

""We have 670,000 Mississippians who suffer from food insecurity,"" St. John said. ""(Of those,) 250,000 are school kids who get a school breakfast and a school lunch, but then don't eat again until the next day.

""We have seniors who don't know whether to pay the light bill or buy food.""

According to the Mississippi Health and Hunger Atlas from the University of Mississippi, food insecurity is high in Forrest County, lower in Lamar. Extra Table says there are more hungry individuals in Hinds County — 57,000 — than the entire population of North Dakota.

Much needs to be done. The additional monies required to meet food needs in Mississippi is more than $282.8 million.

Extra Table is a two-person operation running on a shoestring budget. Administrative costs are not taken out of donations received for food. The services provided are critically important to eliminating hunger in Mississippi and beyond, as St. John considers expanding Extra Table's reach to the entire South and the country.

Allen said Extra Table is about more than feeding hungry people. By giving them healthy, low-sodium, low-sugar food, the nonprofit is providing efficient fuel to power brains and souls.

""When you give someone food, you give them hope and belief to go on and survive another day,"" she said.

For St. John, Extra Table has become a mission. He enjoys running restaurants, he said, but Extra Table feeds his heart.

""I'm a guy who sells filet mignon for a living,"" he said. ""But I also get canned tuna to places that need it.

""At the end of the day, I'd like to be known as the guy who gets food to people who don't have food.""

109,"Dec 1, 2020",Civil Eats,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped from the USDA’s Food Box Program,"Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

“’Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes—part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program—came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Lula Cooley. Lula Cooley.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers—giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce.

“When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers. They were just left out. There was a big void that was left,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director.

Despite Challenges, Program Helps Farmers, Families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers—a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss.

“Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit.

“This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale, Burkett said, because of an incredible upswelling of community support.

“Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” added the farmer. “It brought the community together.”","Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

Extra Table is a feeding charity that I founded in 2009. We supply healthy food to mission pantries and soup kitchens all across the state. Beginnings don’t get humbler than the early days of Extra Table. It all started with a phone call from one local mission pantry that was feeding 800 families a month. They were completely out of food and called me to see if there was any way I could help them stock the shelves.

Out of that one phone call, an idea was born based on the premise, “What if every business and home had an extra table where they could feed those in need?” To be honest with you, though, I wasn’t even sure if there was a hunger problem in Mississippi. So, I went on a fact-finding mission visiting soup kitchens and mission pantries across the state, and it didn’t take long to learn that there is a huge hunger problem in Mississippi.

What I learned is that almost 25% of the state suffers from what the government calls “food insecurity.” In Mississippi, a quarter of the state’s children eat a school breakfast and a school lunch and then don’t eat again until the next day. There are also over 100,000 seniors who – at this very moment – are trying to figure out whether they can pay the light bill or go to the grocery store. The problem is real, and the problem is serious.

It’s not that Mississippi didn't have enough agencies to feed those in need. Mississippi is blessed to have many agencies on the front lines of hunger, and they are all staffed by dedicated people and hundreds of volunteers. The problem is that the agencies couldn’t keep food on the shelves to keep up with the demand.

Extra Table’s initial working model was based on my experience in the restaurant world. In the early days, we used the purchasing power of foodservice distributors – and their distribution capabilities – to send food directly to Mississippi’s feeding agencies. Over time, Extra Table’s business model changed to where we often cut out the middleman these days and – along with our partners at Chow Purchasing – acquire food directly from growers, canners and suppliers and deliver it ourselves. By doing that, we increased our effectiveness.

I could teach a master class on how to start and grow a nonprofit. Most of the class would be spent on how hard it is in the early years to gain footing and become effective. Growing a 501(c)(3) is a very slow and arduous process. Around our eighth year we started seeing major growth. But in our 11th year, and in the middle of a global pandemic, we hit our stride.

The timing has to have been a God thing. When Mississippians needed food the most, Extra Table was set up and ready to deliver it to them. By almost all accounts, 2020 was a terrible year on almost every front, but when it comes to food insecurity, and feeding Mississippians in need, Extra Table saw unprecedented growth and success.

From day one of opening my first restaurant in 1987, I have always believed in one core principle: always give credit where credit is due. A major part of Extra Table’s unprecedented success in 2020 should be credited to our volunteers, donors and partners. But it takes leadership to accomplish great things, and for the last three years, Extra Table has been led by an amazing woman who possesses the perfect skill set for a nonprofit executive director – endless energy, total passion and commitment for the cause, the ability to communicate the need to others, prodigious team building, and the dedication to work tirelessly for those in need. That person is Martha Allen, and for more than half of 2020, she ran a statewide nonprofit as the lone employee. It wasn’t until late summer that she added a second employee (keep that in mind while reading the following paragraph).

The charitable feeding community measures food distribution and effectiveness in pounds. In 2019 – our most effective year to date – Extra Table distributed 268,000 pounds of food. In 2020, working under the adverse conditions of a global pandemic, Extra Table’s Martha Allen, her staff of one and hundreds of dedicated volunteers distributed over 1,200,000 pounds of food to Mississippians in need. That’s more than a 400% increase over the previous year. And if a 400% increase wasn’t impressive enough, we also partnered with Borden Dairy and distributed over half of a million gallons of milk – that’s an additional 4,700,000 pounds to those in the charitable feeding community – to agencies and citizens from north Mississippi to the Gulf Coast (a more than 2,200% increase).

Extra Table started the year delivering healthy food 39 agencies in 32 counties. We ended 2020 by partnering with 62 feeding agencies in 49 Mississippi counties.

One of the things I am most proud of when it comes to Extra Table is that two of our core principles from day one have been that 100% of the money we raise for food is used to purchase food. (We started an entirely new 501(c)(3) to raise money for our minimal administrative costs so we can always stay true to that mission.) Secondly, the food we purchase will always be healthy food. The Extra Table model is unique. We operate on a shoestring out of a borrowed corner of my business office. There may be another statewide nonprofit that operates with only two paid staff, but I would bet several paychecks that you couldn’t find one that is as effective.

In 2020, Extra Table Executive Director Martha Allen, Director of Development Rhonda Hayden, Chow Purchasing and hundreds of volunteers delivered 25,000 pounds of Mississippi Gulf shrimp; 35,000 pounds of rice, grits, and beans; 95,000 pounds of chicken; 160,000 pounds of potatoes; 550,000 gallons of milk; and 840,000 eggs to Mississippians in need.

Extra Table has gone from a steady crawl to an all-out sprint, but we are just getting started in Mississippi’s hunger battle. The future is bright as one of our main initiatives in 2021 will be reimagining the old and outdated canned food drive model. We took the first steps of that this year with our new box project in which we began distributing boxes of healthy food to those in need. For more information on that effort, and how you can be a part of one of Mississippi’s fastest growing and most effective nonprofits, go to extratable.org.

111,"Aug 7, 2020",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Immigrants in Mississippi ICE raids suffer; plants see few penalties,"Hours after immigration agents arrested about 680 Mississippi poultry plant employees in the largest single-state worksite raid in the country’s history, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had a message for employers.

“To those who take advantage of illegal aliens, to those who use illegal aliens for a competitive advantage or to make a quick buck, we have something to say to you. If we find that you have violated federal criminal law, we’re coming after you,” Hurst said in a news conference on Aug. 7, 2019.

One year later, attorneys and advocates say there is a grave imbalance. The consequences for workers, their families and communities have been devastating and could last for years. In contrast, the top executives at the chicken processing companies targeted in the raids have yet to face penalties for their role in hiring hundreds of undocumented workers and profiting from their labor.

On Aug. 6, Hurst held a news conference at the federal courthouse in Jackson, Miss., to announce the unsealed indictments of four managers at two of the seven chicken processing plants that federal agents raided one year prior. Hurst did not announce any charges against company owners.

Three weeks prior to the news conference, Hurst sat down for a one-on-one interview to discuss the progress of the investigation and why, at that time, no managers at the chicken plants had been charged with any crimes.

Hurst said the investigation — slightly delayed by COVID-19 — was still ongoing as federal agents were combing through millions of pages of documents and terabytes of data seized from the companies.

“Let me be clear: We don’t have any hesitation to bring charges against anyone,"" Hurst said in an interview on July 17. ""There’s not going to be any inside or outside influence that either pressures us to prosecute or pressures us not to prosecute.”

Still, many have been critical of how federal agents carried out the raids and the continued absence of prosecution for owners of chicken processing companies.

Among them is Cliff Johnson, director of the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center, who had previously worked as an assistant U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration and helped represent workers in the aftermath of the August raids.

“The government must not ignore the behavior of corporate fat cats while zip-tying and locking up more than 600 workers making less than $15 an hour. Selective prosecution of the poor and vulnerable is repugnant and does not reflect the values of this country as I understand them,” Johnson said in early July.

Hurst has defended the process and maintains that his office's primary goal is to ensure law and order. Plant employees who worked under stolen identities will be treated no differently than anyone else who breaks the law and is brought to justice, he said.

When the evidence shows that the companies knowingly hired undocumented workers, then Hurst said he wouldn't hesitate to prosecute employers in criminal court — which his office has done successfully on eight occasions in the last 14 years.

If the government starts turning a blind eye to undocumented immigrants, ""then you’re not going to have any more respect for the law, and pretty soon you’re not going to have order. We’re going to have chaos,"" Hurst said.

For hundreds of undocumented Mississippians and their families, the chaos began a year ago.

Employers 'never suffer what we have had to suffer'

The morning after the raids, Ermicenda Perez was released at 4 a.m., with an ankle monitor and the promise that ICE would call her to court for immigration hearings.

She was arrested while working at PH Food, her employer of eight years and one of two poultry plants in the rural town of Morton, where semi trucks filled with live caged chickens regularly roll past downtown.

Perez broke down as she recalled the raids last year.

“It’s hard to talk about,” she whispered, lowering her head and fighting back tears.

As the single mother of two teenage girls, Perez was among about 300 workers released within 27 hours of the raids on humanitarian grounds. While she’s home with her daughters, she hasn’t been able to work and is relying on donations to help cover bills and feed her family.

“It’s hard not being able to do anything,” Perez said. “To go from working, to sitting at home not being able to do anything. It’s hard to bear because I came here to work. ... I was just trying to support my family.”

While hundreds of families face housing instability, food insecurity, criminal prosecution, deportation and family separation, history shows that worksite raids are often mere blips in a company’s operations, according to experts interviewed for this report.

Across the country, most employers are never criminally prosecuted after an ICE raid, said Jessie Hahn, a labor and employment policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. Hahn said criminal cases are typically settled in court with the company agreeing to pay a fine and operate under ICE monitoring for several years. Company managers or owners could face jail time, but it’s rare, she said.

POTENTIAL PENALTIES: Mississippi ICE raids: Employers can face civil, criminal charges

One undocumented worker put it this way, according to immigration attorney Amelia McGowan, who works for the Mississippi Center for Justice and helped represent many who were arrested during the raids: “I had to work in terrible conditions, my husband is in jail, I’ve got an ankle monitor. The people who ran these companies are sitting at home and they’re fine. They will never suffer what we have had to suffer and had to suffer for this company.”

Some workers deported, others fight to stay with families

The ICE operation and investigation, which began 18 months before the raids and continues to this day, cost taxpayers more than $1.3 million, according to ICE officials in November 2019.

A spokesman for the federal agency has declined to provide an updated cost estimate or confirm the number of deportees. McGowan estimates at least 170 workers have been deported.

The majority of workers remained in ICE detention for weeks or months following arrests. It’s unclear how many were able to bond out and how many are still detained in centers, some of which face allegations of lack of food, inadequate medical care, unsanitary conditions and have been the sites of COVID-19 outbreaks.

EXCLUSIVE: Ankle monitors and informants: How ICE chose 7 Mississippi food plants to raid

According to ICE, a total of 126 people have been charged with committing federal crimes, 73 of whom have been convicted. The workers were accused of illegally re-entering the country after a previous deportation, as well as document fraud from working under someone else's name or social security number. The four managers were charged with harboring undocumented immigrants and making false statements to law enforcement, among other crimes.

In November, Congressman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., held a hearing on the ICE raids to criticize the federal approach to arresting Latino workers who, according to testimony by the sheriff of Scott County, posed no threat to public safety and were valued members of their communities.

At the congressional hearing, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, criticized law enforcement's lack of action against company leaders.

""You don't have a perp walk for the employers. They don't get arrested. You don't handcuff them and take them away. ... You knew before you came that laws were being broken, but you picked on the undocumented persons,"" Green said.

Last year, lines of manacled men and women shuffled into federal courtrooms in Jackson. They conferred in hurried whispers with their attorneys through interpreters. Some faced the judge with stony faces, others wiped away their tears.

THE CHILDREN: Where are Mom and Dad? School on standby to help children in aftermath of ICE raids

Watching the hearings unfold, it struck Federal Public Defender Omodare Jupiter that he had never seen so many young mothers brought into court before. The defendants had fled abuse and poverty in their home countries so they could work in “terrible conditions for very little pay in just in hopes of trying to give their children a better life,” Jupiter said.

“To use the criminal justice system to prosecute people in those types of circumstances, to this day I don’t understand it,” he said. “I don’t understand it at all.”

Critics: Raids part of escalating immigration enforcement

The ICE operation in Mississippi was the largest in a series of escalating worksite raids in recent years, said Wendy Cervantes, director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy, who researched the impacts of raids in Mississippi and other states.

Cervantes and other immigrant advocates have criticized how federal agents executed the raids in Mississippi. She described the raids as “aggressive and militaristic” and Mississippians she interviewed likened it to a terrorist attack, Cervantes said.

“The cruelty with how individuals were treated seemed completely unnecessary. I talked to one mother who didn’t have an opportunity to use the bathroom or clean herself for more than two days. She was suffering from infection,” Cervantes said.

Hahn said the raids were carried out in a way “intentionally to terrorize immigrant workers and their communities while employers have faced minimal consequences.”

Hundreds of workers were taken into custody during ICE raids at seven Mississippi chicken processing plants on Aug. 7, 2019, and those who were released days later were given ankle monitors.

Hurst said that’s an “absolute falsehood.”

He said federal agents went to “extraordinary measures to try to make sure that families were minimally disrupted” by checking if children at home had at least one parental caretaker and dropping off workers where they were arrested after release.

“This really was the most compassionate execution of criminal search warrants I’ve ever seen involving immigration violations,” Hurst said. “I know people are going to disagree with that and that’s fine. But we did ... put a lot of thought into making sure that people were treated humanely, and with respect.”

Hurst points to history of prosecuting employers

Hurst disagrees with those who cast families impacted by the raids in a sympathetic light. The same kind of attention isn’t paid to the hundreds of other defendants prosecuted by his office any given year, Hurst said.

“It really bothers me there’s a double standard just because this is a hot political issue, just because people don’t agree necessarily with our immigration laws,” he said.

Focus instead on the U.S. citizens whose identities were stolen and social security benefits were interrupted, Hurst urged. ICE found at least 400 stolen social security numbers related to the ongoing criminal investigation, spokesman Bryan Cox said.

Victims of identity fraud aren’t the only ones that have benefited from the arrests of undocumented immigrants, Hurst said.

“I think all the American citizens who flooded into these companies, applying for jobs that were opened up are better off,"" he said. ""I think we’re all better off because at least in the state of Mississippi, employers want to think twice now about trying to hire illegal aliens.""

Hurst said his office “probably has prosecuted more employers for criminal immigration violations per capita than any other non-border state in the nation.”

According to a list provided by Hurst, since 2006, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi has prosecuted a manager or owner in eight cases against employers ranging from small family-owned restaurants to one of the biggest employers in the state.

The largest case was that of electrical transformer plant Howard Industries, which resulted in the arrests of nearly 600 workers in 2008. The company was sentenced to one year probation and required to pay a $2.5 million fine. A human resources manager, Jose Humberto Gonzalez, was sentenced to six months house arrest and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine.

PAST RAIDS: Undocumented workers busted. Employers often not. What we learned from 6 ICE raids in U.S.

Hurst said he has a long-held belief that the government must go after employers who violate federal criminal laws.

“Jobs are a magnet of those who want to come into our country illegally,” Hurst said. “If you do not (prosecute employers), that magnet is only going to grow stronger and individuals are only going to want to come in here in larger droves illegally for those jobs.”

Chicken plants not likely to see long-term impact from raids

The day after the raids, PH Food manager Jun Liang showed a reporter around the silent and near-empty plant, and reflected on the arrests of about 80 of his workers.

""To me, it's not logical that they've done this. What about (the immigrants') families? They have to make a living, they have kids. Right?"" Liang said. ""They didn't do anything bad, they just want to make money, raise their kids.""

Reached by phone nearly a year later, Liang declined to talk, citing advice from his attorney. Other poultry companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.

There’s no doubt the companies suffered a staffing shortage after losing hundreds of workers to the raids. Just five days later, Koch Foods held a job fair in Forest, where a few dozen prospective workers showed up to learn more about how they could be paid $12 an hour to kill and process chickens.

It’s unlikely that chicken plants will be impacted in the longterm, said Angela Stuesse a professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, who spent years living in Mississippi and researching Latino immigration and the poultry industry.

“We know that this industry is really very sophisticated at figuring out how to locate and tap into the most exploitable work forces,” Stuesse said. “They’ve shown historically they can very quickly replace even very large segments of the workforce that they lose.”

However, new hires don’t necessarily stay employed long term, Johnson said.

“I’ve been told stories about new workers appearing on the job and leaving before the end of the day due to the difficulty of the work and the unpleasant realities of processing thousands of chicken each shift,” Johnson said.

Who replaces the new hires after they leave? Hahn and community advocates have said in some cases, the same people who were arrested one year ago are re-hired into the plants. Though these assertions are anecdotal and have not been independently tracked or confirmed.

“I have heard in Mississippi ... the (undocumented) workers are absolutely going back in — going back in more vulnerable to exploitation than before,” Hahn said.

The same communities devastated by the raids are now among legions of essential workers who continued to march to their shifts even as most of Mississippi’s economy shut down at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through the raids and now the pandemic, plants continued to churn out millions of chickens to be sent to dinner tables across America.

After learning a nearby chicken plant did not provide adequate personal protective equipment to their workers, a group of women in Forest decided to take matters into their own hands. They took out sewing machines and got to work. They ended up donating close to 1,700 cloth masks to chicken plant workers and a local hospital.

For them, the mission was personal. They were arrested at the same plant last year.

The coronavirus has spread among chicken plant workers and Latinos at high rates. There’s a sad irony, reflected Father Odel Medina, whose parishioners in Carthage were hit hard by the raids, in that chicken plant employees are now considered essential workers by the government.

“You say these people have to go ... because they don’t belong here,"" Medina said. ""When we need them, we tell them they’re essential. That is very immoral.""

“Nissan has been a longstanding supporter of Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee for nearly 30 years,” said Nancy Keil, president, and CEO of Second Harvest. “A lot of industries are struggling right now, so we were truly blown away by Nissan’s generosity in doubling their annual gift to $200,000. As we continue to face so much uncertainty, this donation will ensure 800,000 meals are provided to our neighbors in need.”

Nissan and Second Harvest have a long-standing partnership, with the automaker being the first to earn the food bank’s Mission Partner title. This designation refers to a business or organization that provides financial support of $100,000+ each year. So far, Nissan has donated close to $1.7 million to Second Harvest of Middle Tennessee and five vehicles. Its employees also volunteer their time and energy at the food bank’s warehouses.

Dental caries, or the disease that causes tooth decay, has been linked to food insecurity – a disruption in food intake or eating patterns due to a lack of resources – in numerous studies. Delta Dental of California and its affiliates, through the Foundation, employee support and corporate giving, have strengthened food banks across its enterprise states for years. As the economic crisis caused by the pandemic continues, it became clear it was time to increase that support exponentially.

Today the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation is announcing $2.5 million in funding to food banks across 15 states and Washington, D.C. This is in addition to $11 million in previously awarded grants in response to COVID-19. Foundation support in 2020 totals nearly $15 million, including nearly $300,000 to nonprofits in Mississippi.

KASIMU HARRIS, EVE EDELHEIT, PATIENCE ZALANGA Getty Images We Live in the Richest Country in the World — Yet Millions of Americans Go to Bed Hungry In this special report, Good Housekeeping and Feeding America explore the complex issue of food insecurity through photographs.



The statistics on hunger in America are staggering. One in nine people in the U.S. is food insecure, meaning they lack consistent access to healthy meals, and many have visited a food bank in the past year. Now, as we brace for what could be the worst recession in more than a decade, millions of people hit by unemployment and struggling with poverty are newly at risk of not having enough to eat. To capture a literal snapshot of the issue and to highlight steps communities are taking to tackle it, Good Housekeeping, in partnership with Feeding America, sent photographers across the country, from the Louisiana bayou to the farmlands of Iowa and a religious community in Houston. The results reveal a resilient beauty in cities working hard to keep people fed. Our Growing Need In 2020, food insecurity is projected to increase by the highest percentage in parts of the South and Southwest. For example, in Mississippi, one in three people could go hungry this year.

Dead last and ranked 50th.

According to the just-released Map the Meal Gap 2019 report from Feeding America, 24.1% of kids age 18 and younger in New Mexico – that’s one of every four children – are at risk of childhood hunger and food insecurity.

The 2018 Map the Meal Gap also had New Mexico as dead last, and the 2017 report had the state ranked 49th.

This year’s 49th place holder is Arkansas with 23.6% of at-risk food insecure kids, then Louisiana at 23% and Mississippi at 22.9%.

................................................................

In contrast, the states with the fewest percentage of kids who are at risk of food insecurity are North Dakota, ranked first with 9.8% of kids, followed by Massachusetts at 11.7%, New Hampshire with 12.3% and Minnesota with 12.6%.

The Map the Meal Gap also showed that 324,000 people of all ages in the state, or 15.8% of the entire population, are at risk of hunger.

The worst five counties in New Mexico with the highest percentage of child hunger, according to the report are: McKinley, with 33.5%; Luna, 33.4%; Cibola and Catron, each with 30.4%; and Sierra, 27.8%.

Feeding America is the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States, coordinating a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. Together they provide meals to more than 46 million people each year. Roadrunner Food Bank is part of the Feeding America network.

Roadrunner Food Bank spokeswoman, Sonya Warwick, said food insecurity is generally understood as the inability of individuals or families to know where a portion of their food will come from at any given time.

“In some instances, that food insecurity results from adults in a family having unreliable seasonal jobs, or hourly workers suddenly finding that their hours were reduced, people who are unemployed or underemployed, those facing homelessness, domestic violence or health issues,” Warwick said.

Many people fall into the gray area, “where they’re still very poor, but make just over what might qualify them for federal food assistance programs, and that’s when Road Runner and statewide affiliated food partners can step in to help them,” Warwick said.

Of course the biggest factor in a state’s child hunger and food insecurity is the number of children who live in poverty. New Mexico is near the top of this list also.

Sharon Kayne, spokeswoman for New Mexico Voices for Children, said 27% of kids in our state live in poverty, ranking us 49th on this list, tied with Mississippi, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and compiled by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Only Louisiana fares worse, ranked in 50th place with 28% of kids living in poverty.

119,"Nov 30, 2019",HottyToddy.com,Student Co-Directors Work Against Student Food Insecurity at UM,"The University of Mississippi Food Bank provides a discrete and much-needed source for food, hygiene products and more for Ole Miss students and employees each week.

Supported primarily through donations, the UM Food Bank provides hundreds of meals each semester. Since the fall semester began in August, the Food Bank, housed in Kinard Hall, Room 213, has provided an estimated 1,266 meals to community members.

Working behind-the-scenes at the Food Bank are Kate Reinhardt, a senior secondary mathematics education major, and Holten Moreno, a senior business administration major. Together, they serve as the Food Bank’s co-directors.

“As an education major, I know how important it is that students have access to food,” said Reinhardt, a St. Louis native. “Students shouldn’t have to worry about where their next meal will come from, and I just want to make sure that we can help get rid of that extra stress for them.”

Reinhardt began working with the Food Bank in 2018 as a member of the fundraising committee. Through her work as fundraising chair, she quickly realized how big an impact the Food Bank has on fighting student food insecurity.

The work lit a new passion in Reinhardt. After her first year, she decided to apply to be co-director in 2019. She began her new role earlier this year and has remained committed to helping fight student food insecurity at Ole Miss.

“I realized that I loved helping as fundraising chair so much and that helping the Food Bank was something that I really wanted to get more involved with,” Reinhardt said.

Moreno began working with the Food Bank in 2017 as a member of the volunteer and training committee. Before coming to UM, she was involved with a food bank in her hometown of Washington, D.C., and wanted to continue to work against food insecurity in Oxford.

“I think a food bank is particularly important on college campuses due to the rising expenses at this time of many students’ lives,” Moreno said. “Unfortunately, most of the time, money is pulled from their food budget, which is where we come in, and oftentimes students will try to go days without eating due to not being able to afford meals.

“We give them the opportunity to find their footing again financially by using the Food Bank to cut out cost from their budget.”

As co-directors, Reinhardt and Moreno work together to coordinate and plan with the student committee that oversees the resource’s operations. This semester alone, student volunteers have dedicated more than 205 hours to its operation, not counting the time committed by the student leadership team or group-based volunteering activities.

“Holten and Kate do an excellent job running the Food Bank,” said Lindsey Abernathy, associate director of the Office of Sustainability and staff adviser of the Food Bank. “The student directors are in charge of all operations, which is no small task, especially when also taking classes.”

The UM Food Bank is a registered student organization with the goal of ending campus hunger by providing food and hygiene products to students and employees. Its services are free to all students who might need it, regardless of financial situations.

“I think that sometimes students are unsure whether or not they qualify for our services, and we’re trying to focus on promoting the Food Bank as a place where all students can go, regardless of their financial situation,” Reinhardt said. “We focus on being discreet and not asking for any personal information regarding student ID number, name or financial information.”

Reinhardt and Moreno’s passion for serving the community in this capacity has only grown since they began working with the organization. Together, they lean on each other to make sure the Food Bank can provide for students and staff, and work to improve it any way they can.

“In addition to the daily operations of the Food Bank, the students are always looking toward the future and what else the Food Bank can offer,” Abernathy said. “Just this semester, Kate and Holten have worked with Ole Miss Dining Services to pilot a meal swipe donation program.”

Pioneered by Reinhardt and Moreno, this new initiative resulted in 200 meal swipes being donated to the Food Bank. Combined with a 100 percent match by Ole Miss Dining, the Food Bank was able to distribute more than 400 meal swipes to students who needed them in November.

Reinhardt is student-teaching in a geometry class at Pontotoc High School this semester. She will graduate in May with plans to either begin her teaching career or pursue a master’s degree.

Moreno also is set to graduate in May and plans to attend graduate school in England to obtain an MBA.

Reinhardt’s passion for helping those around her and Moreno’s commitment to fighting food insecurity make them a perfect fit as co-directors of the Food Bank.

“We’ve always wanted to help students,” Reinhardt said. “They’re here to learn, and they shouldn’t have to worry about finding food or where their next meal will come from.”

120,"May 16, 2019",The Hill,Criminal justice includes food security — we can't ban the social safety net,"Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has signed criminal justice reform legislation that will ease reentry for people returning home from prison. Among the most notable elements of the new law is an opt out of a 23-year-old federal ban on food stamps and financial assistance for people with felony drug convictions. The change will help protect the many people who confront hunger and poverty upon their release from prison.

Mississippi is the latest state to amend or rescind this cruel federal policy, which emerged when the political consensus of the 1990s supported punitive and racially charged approaches to both drugs and poverty.

President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonGood luck, Dan Bongino! Biden to headline campaign fundraiser for Atlanta mayor The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by Facebook — CDC updates guidelines for students MORE signed legislation in 1996 that significantly restricted access to the social safety net through work and eligibility requirements for financial assistance, and it established a lifetime ban on benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense. The changes followed years of congressional actions to establish harsh mandatory minimums for federal drug offenses and incentivize states to follow its lead in enacting long sentences. Unfair perceptions about people who use drugs, particularly crack cocaine, powered the debate.

While the law permits states to opt out of the ban, and ones as diverse as Arkansas, California, Maine and Wyoming have already done so, 30 states still maintain either a lifetime or modified ban on SNAP, TANF or both.

According to the National Institute of Health, 91 percent of people transitioning from incarceration report experiencing food insecurity. Moreover, employment opportunities for returning residents are limited because of outdated or inadequate skills, medical and mental health challenges and employer bias. A Harvard University study conducted by Bruce Western of 120 people in Boston found an initial average annual income of just $6,500 after incarceration.

The impoverished status of people leaving incarceration also exacerbates the financial conditions of the poor families to whom they return. By definition, families share with one another; more people in a household without more resources translates to less food for everyone in the family, including children.

States that have rejected the tough on crime approach to welfare reform have improved public safety outcomes. One study found that recidivism rates declined up to 10 percent one year after release when cash assistance and food stamps were immediately available to people returning home.

The growing bipartisan consensus supporting criminal justice reform should recognize the need to support people reentering our communities with educational services, drug treatment, housing assistance and financial and nutritional support. Indeed, a recent proclamation issued by President Trump Donald TrumpGood luck, Dan Bongino! The Hill's Morning Report - Biden's next act: Massive infrastructure plan with tax hikes Conservative group says polling shows Dems' voting rights bill 'out of sync with American voters' MORE declared April 2019 Second Chance Month, and committed “to providing support and resources that former inmates need to meet their responsibilities, rediscover their self‑worth, and benefit from the gift of a second chance.” His commitment should include supporting legislation to end the TANF and SNAP bans for people with drug felony convictions. These reforms are foundational to successful reintegration.

Fortunately, Congress may be showing it has learned from the mistakes of its past. Last year, the U.S. Senate successfully held off an amendment incorporated into the House of Representatives’ bill to reauthorize SNAP that would have extended the lifetime food stamp ban to people convicted of violent offenses. The amendment, which would have permanently excluded people from accessing food assistance regardless of the date of their offense, was widely opposed by civil rights and anti-hunger organizations as well as conservative groups known for their embrace of criminal justice reform. Its defeat is a hopeful sign.

In Mississippi, an estimated 67,000 people — disproportionately women — will gain access to food stamps because of the state’s decision to lift the federal ban. While championing the new law, Republican state Sen. Sally Dotson said, “the overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities."" Evidence suggests that in this respect, Mississippi is on the right track.

121,"Nov 5, 2020",BetaBoston,Study: A million people in Mass. don’t have enough food,"Massachusetts has seen the highest percent increase of residents facing food insecurity of all states, according to new projections released by Feeding America last Friday. The hunger rate in the state has increased 59 percent since 2018, representing more than 1 million people who are now struggling to get enough to eat. The child food-insecurity rate has also worsened, with one in five children in Massachusetts now living in food-insecure households, a 102 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 levels. (Norfolk County in Massachusetts has the highest percent change in child food-insecurity in the country, with a 163 percent increase in 2020 versus 2018.)

As the country awaits the returns of the presidential election and any prospects of another economic stimulus bill, one thing has remained consistent amid the pandemic: People in Massachusetts are going hungry. And the problem is only growing.

The overall food insecurity rate in Massachusetts is projected to reach 14.2 percent this year. The highest rates in the United States will be in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, which could each have more than 20 percent of their citizens facing hunger. And California is predicted to have 6.2 million people who are having trouble getting enough to eat, the largest total number of any state in the country.

“The need isn’t going anywhere,” said Catherine Drennan, the director of public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, which served over 600,000 people in September, a 120 percent increase over last year.

November and December are typically some of the busiest months for local food banks, but the combined economic, political, and public health crises facing the Commonwealth will make this year unlike any other, said Drennan. She said the food bank is planning to provide 20 million meals as part of its annual Hunger Free Holidays campaign.

New issues with a federal food-distribution program have stoked anxieties further among local organizations working to provide food to those in need. Back in May, as part of the CARES Act, the USDA launched its $4.5 billion Farmers to Families Food Box program, working with US farmers to purchase and distribute boxes of agricultural products. During the first three rounds of the program, several vendors in New England were awarded eight-week contracts, and each built a network of local distributors to hand out hundreds of thousands of prepacked boxes filled with dairy, meat, and produce.

Many of the boxes ended up being distributed to local nonprofits — like the Brazilian Workers Center in Allston — which are operating outside the established regional food bank networks, having launched or expanded emergency food services as they saw the need in their communities.

“Since COVID-19, we’ve had to repurpose our regular services to meet food insecurity in the community,” said the Brazilian Workers Center’s executive director, Natalicia Tracy. “The Boston food banks weren’t equipped to handle the demand, and we saw a huge increase in need for food in Allston. So the USDA boxes were really critical.” The Brazilian Workers Center now feeds 500 families each week.

But the execution of the food box program has been fraught. Farmers who won contracts and planted crops for the program were left high and dry when they weren’t chosen as vendors in subsequent rounds. In some parts of the country, there were concerns about the nutritional value of the goods included in the boxes. The USDA also faced blowback last month after President Trump required that a signed letter from him be included in each box.

In the agency’s latest funding round announced last Friday, no Massachusetts vendors were awarded contracts. This will likely mean significant delays in getting the next round of local food distributions up and running, leaving partner organizations like Tracy’s scrambling to find sources for food as they head toward Thanksgiving. So earlier this week, she headed back to the store. “We’ve already purchased 1,200 pounds of rice, beans, and pasta, and some produce. We’re still trying to figure out whatever we can get our hands on,” she said.

Those who have been working with the USDA say that the changes will put undue pressure on the Massachusetts food bank system during its busiest season.

“In two weeks these pantries are going to burn through whatever dry goods they have in back stock,"" said Sean Buchanan, the vice president of sales at Costa Fruit and Produce, one of the local distributors whose vendor contract with the USDA was not renewed. He said Costa handed out more than 889,000 food boxes to 400 partners since the program launched, only to have to turn off the faucet for the distributions on Monday.

“It’s a perfect storm for food insecurity,"" he said.

The USDA’s decision also forced produce distributor Katsiroubas Bros. to lay off 40 staff members overnight, said Torry Katsiroubas Stamm, the company’s president. Over the past several months, the Boston-based distributor had set up an elaborate supply chain and partnered with the nonprofit Boston Area Gleaners to deliver more than 10 million pounds of food to nonprofits, public housing sites, and food banks throughout New England, she said. The program has helped keep her business afloat as her restaurant and food service accounts have cut back on orders amid the pandemic.

Now, that supply chain has been upended, and a new company in Long Island, N.Y., has been given the contract and has to start over creating a distribution plan from scratch, she said.

“Our partners have been calling us, and we don’t have anything to tell them,” Katsiroubas said. “They’re panicked."" She said she feels the same level of stress she heard from her customers back in March, “with everyone saying ‘What do we do?' We’re still here, it feels like it’s happening again.”

“Before this program got up and running, we saw a lot of nonprofits that had never moved food or dealt with food moving thousands of boxes or grocery bags a week,” said Dylan Frazier, the director of strategy for the Boston Area Gleaners, which worked as both a vendor and partner with local distributors to make USDA food box deliveries. “We’re telling people you have to call the food bank, we don’t have any food for you,” he said. “People are flipping out. It’s panic mode. There’s still a line of a thousand or two thousand people with no food.”

Food pantry lines have already been getting longer over the past several months at the Salvation Army of Chelsea and East Boston, said Captain Isael Gonzalez, who oversees the emergency food program there. So, having to wait for the USDA program to restart with new vendors from out of state means he’s now struggling to serve the 700 families that seek out his services daily.

“Through the USDA program, we’ve been distributing over 2,100 boxes each week to families out of our office, and the good part is the boxes come prepacked, and there’s no labor on our end,” Gonzales said. “Not having those boxes is going to have a huge impact: It’s more trips to the Greater Boston Food Bank, more relying on local donations from different resources, and a lot of labor intensity on our part too.”

Ultimately, the USDA Food Box program provides just a small percentage of the overall food assistance currently in place in the region. But “we’ll take every food source we can and it’s definitely helpful,” Drennan, of the Greater Boston Food Bank, said. More importantly, she added, the program is set to expire by year’s end, and “unless another stimulus package comes out and they decide to renew, I don’t know what will happen.”

122,"May 21, 2018",,Summer hunger and how you can help - The Oxford Eagle,"Today, the EAGLE ran a story about food insecurity in Lafayette County, after a study released by Feeding America showed some surprising statistics.

The study named Mississippi the hungriest state, with 600,840 citizens – 176,580 of them children – struggling with food insecurity. In other words, a whopping one in five Mississippians don’t know where their next meal is coming from.

Lafayette County’s statistics aren’t much better, with 9,850 people considered food-insecure. 56 percent of the population lives below the SNAP threshold.

Food insecurity refers to USDA’s measure of lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods. Food-insecure households are not necessarily food insecure all the time.

Food insecurity may reflect a household’s need to make trade-offs between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bills, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods.

No parent should ever have to choose between providing a meal for their children or paying for basic needs. After reading all these statistics, I had to stop and ask myself, what have I done to help those people? What has the individual Oxonian done to help these people?

I say it often, and proudly, that the LOU community is one of the most generous I’ve ever seen. People here have a heart for philanthropy, and the money to support various causes.

Organizations like Interfaith Compassion Ministries, the Pantry, Lovepacks, Oxford Community Market, the Summer Meals program, various churches and on-campus groups work tirelessly to help those who may be in need. Others do so in secret, expecting no recognition, or simply volunteer their time.

When I spoke to Oxford School District’s director of child nutrition, Dan Westmoreland, I asked him, ‘What can the average person do to help the Summer Meal Program?’ His answer was simple: if you know a child in need, bring them. No strings attached, just give a child access to a healthy, balanced meal.

Food insecurity is its most prevalent during the summer months. With school out, children might only get one meal a day, not exactly enough to provide them with the energy they need to function.

Westmoreland’s suggestion led me to dig a little deeper and figure out warning signs for determining if a child is dealing with summer hunger. According to the YMCA’s national website, there are five telltale signs a child may be starving.

Some are more obvious, like if a child asks about food every day or if they’re not picky. Hoarding snacks or suddenly gaining or losing weight are also red flags. Others, however, require a little more perception. If a child’s teeth are decaying, it may be an indicator that the child has an inadequate diet. If they’re aggressive towards others or have a reputation as a bully, they may simply be “hangry” (hungry and angry). If they’re tired, or seem to have no energy, they could be going to bed with an empty stomach.

If you do know of a child or family who’s going hungry, there are ways to help directly. On a grand scale, you can organize a canned food drive or start a community garden. On a smaller, more personal scale, you can spread the word about programs available, or simply invite a friend over for dinner. Even clipping coupons for families in need can be the difference between going hungry and having a decent meal.

My hope is, in sharing these facts with readers, at least one child, one family, will receive the help they need. You might only be this child’s Sunday school teacher, their camp counselor, their neighbor, their babysitter. But you could also be the one person to take notice and do something to help.","Today, the EAGLE ran a story about food insecurity in Lafayette County, after a study released by Feeding America showed some surprising statistics.
The study named Mississippi the hungriest state, with 600,840 citizens – 176,580 of them children – struggling with food insecurity.
Food insecurity is its most prevalent during the summer months.
Westmoreland’s suggestion led me to dig a little deeper and figure out warning signs for determining if a child is dealing with summer hunger.

123,"Jun 19, 2020",CBS News,Food scarcity is on the rise in America as the economy reels,"The number of American families struggling to put food on the table has seen a ""substantial"" increase since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve of St. Louis said in a new analysis of Census Bureau data.

Food insecurity — defined as the inability to afford healthy food for all family members — affected 37 million U.S. households even before the start of the disease outbreak. That's due in part to widening income inequality, which has undercut the economic gains during the weak recovery that followed the Great Recession. But food shortages are on the rise as unemployment has surged into double-digits and many workers are furloughed without pay.

More than 10% of households said they sometimes or often didn't have enough to eat in early June, the St. Louis Fed found. That compares with about 8% of households experiencing food scarcity before March 13, when states began shutting down businesses and layoffs spiked, according to Census data. With at least 21 million workers out of a job, 17 million additional Americans are at risk of becoming food insecure, Feeding America, a nonprofit coalition of food banks, said in a recent report.

""The lines for food at emergency feeding sites offer a picture of the human suffering that data can only begin to explain,"" according to a June 18 letter from Feeding America, along with more than 2,500 other advocacy organizations seeking increased funding for food stamps, that was sent to Senate leaders. ""This crisis demands a response that is commensurate with its scope and seriousness.""

According to Feeding America, nearly a quarter of Mississippi residents — more than 700,000 people — could struggle to get food this year, a sharp jump from previous years. Other states expected to see a spike in food insecurity are Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana.

And while food banks are stepping up, the need is overwhelming. In Houston last month, about 7,000 families showed up for distribution of food at a local food bank. The food bank's manager told ""CBS Evening News"" that demand had jumped 150% from prior to the pandemic.

Other parts of the country have seen similar incidents. In food handouts across the country, thousands of families have lined up in cars to pick up boxes of food, like one in Middlebury, Vermont, where some participants said they had never before experienced food insecurity, according to local newspaper Seven Days.

Trump administration pushes to cut food stamps

Because of increased hunger across the U.S., groups like Feeding America are advocating for a 15% increase in maximum benefits under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the official name for food stamps.

The groups also want an increase in the SNAP minimum monthly benefit from $16 to $30 and a suspension of time limits, as well as a pause in the Trump administration's rule changes that would cut SNAP eligibility and benefits for more than 5 million people.

""Sufficient and timely federal government action is needed to prevent even more human suffering and lost productivity in the short and longer terms,"" the groups said in their letter to Senate leaders this week.

Despite the surge in joblessness and food insecurity during the pandemic, the Trump administration has signaled it's moving forward with cuts to the food stamp program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month said it is appealing a court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from imposing additional work requirements for SNAP on poor adults without children, according to court documents.

The USDA said it was appealing the ruling because it believed it was the ""right approach"" and that it did not expect economic issues to continue indefinitely.","Food insecurity — defined as the inability to afford healthy food for all family members — affected 37 million U.S. households even before the start of the disease outbreak.

124,"Sep 30, 2020",Mississippi Today,Are the kids alright? How Jackson students are surviving the pandemic.,"Kharter, a second grader at Galloway Elementary School in west Jackson, wiggles out of his seat at the Stewpot After-school Program where he’s completing a virtual grammar lesson and strikes a ninja pose.

He nails the look with the black facemask he’s wearing, not as part of a costume, but to guard against the spread of the novel coronavirus.

His classmate Khamiya finishes her schoolwork before begging the teacher to go outside, where she’ll dance on the porch on a gray, drizzly day in late September. She hopes her dad will take her shopping at “Toys R Us” later.

Down the street, Javier and Kelvi, a second and third grader, dart through a classroom at the Boys and Girls Club Capitol Street unit, snatching stacks of notebook paper strips — handmade play money — off each other’s desks. Kelvi soon loses interest in hoarding her stash and playfully tosses the fake cash, letting it shower the linoleum. Her classmates dive to scoop it up.

The last six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the deaths, layoffs, evictions and school closures, have brought immeasurable hardship and heartache, especially to Black and poor communities in Mississippi. The rippling effects seem to have altered most aspects of everyday life — except for a child’s nature.

“They’re still learning with virtual learning. They’re able to still play,” said Brooke Floyd, director of children’s services for Stewpot Community Services. “Like, I think that’s a beautiful thing, when you put kids out in the yard and they don’t have any toys or can’t use the equipment and they still have fun and you can hear the laughter.”

“To me, that’s letting us know that everything’s going to be okay.”

With more than four in ten already living in poverty, Jackson children have long felt the unmet needs — perhaps most visibly a historically underfunded and segregated school system — that the pandemic has illuminated in their communities.

Nearly every child in Jackson Public Schools is Black and lives in a low-income household, qualifying them for free or reduced lunch. School buildings never opened back up after March, spurring a frustrating fight to obtain enough E-learning technology for every student and sticking most families with tough decisions about where their kids will spend their days.

Unemployment benefits are dwindling and despite a federal moratorium, evictions have continued. And while efforts to get meals to children have been possibly the most valiant, food scarcity and affordability remains a persistent problem across the capital city.

This school year so far, the district has recorded 2,600 children — a tenth of their student body — as homeless, which usually means they are living unstably at other families’ homes. Still, about a third live in shelters or hotels. But this isn’t a COVID-19 problem: Last year, JPS had 3,100 enrollees in the federal McKinney-Vento grant to serve homeless students.

“A lot of our kids are so accustomed to going through a lot that it kind of rolls off them,” said Penney Ainsworth, CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Central Mississippi. “Kids will adapt to whatever the setting is and what’s going on. But it’s a scary time. So they’re nervous, but they’re resilient.”

Children at the Boys and Girls Club Walker Unit in south Jackson line up for play time after finishing virtual learning for the day on Sept. 14, 2020. The Club usually operates as an after school program, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic and Jackson Public Schools closures, they’ve met a need in the community for dozens of working families.

Jackson Public Schools does not gather data showing where kids are conducting their virtual schoolwork, the district spokesperson told Mississippi Today, but many traditional afterschool programs like Stewpot Community Services and the Boys and Girls Club started operating at a lower capacity in the daytime to accommodate working parents.

Floyd normally has 40 students at her center, a bright blue house close to the city’s primary soup kitchen. The day camp is limited to 20 kids to ensure they can adhere to social distancing. These community organizations are, too, not able to offer the consistency and stability of the public schools. Just Monday Stewpot had to cancel virtual school for the day after a break-in occurred over the weekend.

“For people to expect the worst or think that the worst is going to happen, I’m not buying it. Even parents that are poor want their kids to succeed and they’re going to try their best to make it happen.” —Brooke Floyd, director of children services for Stewpot Community Services

Some parents have jobs working from home, a separate, difficult juggle, but many are relying on grandparents, aunts, cousins, friends and neighbors to fill in the child care gaps.

Other families are simply uncomfortable with the idea of placing their children in a center during a pandemic, Floyd said, especially knowing the virus has disproportionately taken the lives of Black people. So they’ve done whatever they must, even altering their work life, to keep their kids home.

Floyd and Ainsworth said they have contact with many of the families they’re not serving during this time. They know they can call if they’re in need, Floyd said, “and they do.”

But child services coordinators also recognize there are some children falling through the cracks. Floyd recalled meeting kids over the summer that she’d never seen before while delivering bags of food to apartment complexes where her students live.

“Kids ran to the van. They were like, ‘Can we have a bag?’ And I was like, ‘Where’s your mama?’ ‘I don’t know,'” Floyd said through tears. “I was like, ‘Oh my god. Who are you? What’s your name?’

“They’re lost,” she said. “We help the kids right in front of us, but if you work with children, you’re like, ‘What’s happening to the other kids? Who’s helping them? Who’s checking up on them?’”

Onlookers are quick to blame parents, she added, but a longstanding lack of access to affordable childcare and the drop in unemployment benefits in August have put some working parents, especially those without family support, in impossible situations.

“If I am doing everything I can for my children to survive, unfortunately sometimes I’m going to have to leave them,” she said.

Right/bottom: Johnathan Thomas, a construction estimator for the Mississippi Department of Transportation, a Club volunteer and dad, oversees the class. When he first offered to facilitate, he thought he could use the time to complete his work, but a student in his class lacked a laptop and was conducting her lessons paper packets, so he’s letting her use his computer. He’ll work in the evenings to make up for it. “I think JPS kids are well-adapted … The ones that go here, I think they’re pretty much well-rounded, well-disciplined kids … Everyone’s respectful and that’s all I can really ask for,” Thomas said.

Jackson Public Schools is still offering breakfast and lunch to students during the closures, which has been a big help for the private centers. But the district isn’t otherwise subsidizing these programs, Ainsworth said, leaving most of the physical responsibilities that usually fall on public schools — staffing, sanitizing and keeping the lights on — to a patchwork of community partners.

“School is a safe place for many of our students and not being able to be in that safe place and be around friends and share experiences and that whole social aspect of schooling has all of our hearts heavy,” said Bobby Brown, principal at Jim Hill High School in west Jackson.

Even students who secured devices to use for distance learning have had trouble accessing their classes.

“We kinda have trouble getting into WiFi and stuff because it kinda shut down sometimes and we have to wait for a few minutes,” Keiyana, a fifth grader at Casey Elementary School, told Mississippi Today. “One time I missed class because of that.”

Khamiya, the 7-year-old, said doing all her schoolwork on the computer makes her tired and her hands ache.

“I don’t like online. I want to learn in the classroom. I like it (in-person) but I don’t want to get corona,” Khamiya said. “Whoever made it (the virus), I don’t know who made it, but they should have never made it.”

Kieyana, who attends the Boys and Girls Club Sykes unit in south Jackson, said virtual class is different in one way that adults might not expect: She said her teachers are less likely to yell at students over video calls “because they know that you’ll tell.” Keiyana is a good student; she said she’s getting all A’s and especially likes math and science. When she grows up, she wants to be a pediatrician, a perfect mix of her favorite school subjects and her love of helping care for babies. She said she wishes her school had a gym like the one she plays in at the Club and that her teachers “would stop yelling every now and then.”

Top childhood development experts aren’t as worried about what the impact of COVID-19 and distance learning will be on a child’s ability to keep up with school curriculum. Susan Buttross, a professor of child development at University of Mississippi Medical Center heading up the Mississippi Thrive! Child Health Development Project, said she’s more concerned with the loss of social connections and positive adult reinforcement.

“It’s not that we think kids can’t learn in distance learning,” Buttross said. “People are struggling with making enough money to survive. They’re struggling with so many other social determinants of health, being able to access the right kind of food, and jobs and housing and all of that. So many times, the primary caregiver at home is not equipped to then be the teacher too.”

Anxiety surrounding the virus and grief over a death in the family only compounds the chronic stress children living in poverty already endure. Fleeting stress is normal, Buttross explained, but toxic stress, when a child is constantly on high alert and their stress response system becomes overwhelmed, can hinder their brain development and wreak havoc on their health.

Research shows that the toxic stress of poverty — resulting from economic hardships, racial discrimination, deaths of loved ones or living in an area where violence is prevalent, for example — affects the part of the brain used for decision-making.

Khamiya said her family recently chose to move into a new apartment complex in west Jackson that they thought was in a safer neighborhood.

“We’ve been talking about community. It’s the area where people work and play,” Khamiya said, then she answered how she felt about her west Jackson community: “It’s good, but I don’t like how be people be shooting and killing people.”

The location of prominent community service agencies, west Jackson also has a higher concentration of homeless people than other parts of the city, and therefore higher visibility to someone like Khamiya.

“Do you ever feel bad for homeless people?” she asked this reporter. “I got feeling sad because they need money. They need a house. They need to feel safe.”

Not only are Black Mississippians disproportionately impacted by the nation’s wealth imbalance — three times more likely to live in poverty than whites — they’re also grieving at a higher rate due to converging national crises.

Almost one-third of Black Americans said in a Washington Post-Ipsos survey that they personally knew someone who had died from COVID-19 — compared to less than 10 percent of whites — which coupled with a national spotlight on policy brutality has spawned a bereavement crisis in Black America, Marissa Evans writes in a recent The Atlantic article.

A pair of siblings in Floyd’s program lost their mom in June. Floyd said she was in her thirties and died in her sleep. She didn’t think the mother had been sick.

Another former student, not even 20-years-old, took his own life this summer after becoming entangled in the criminal justice system.

Right as the pandemic began, Stewpot’s bus driver died from cancer. The kids were heartbroken. And they couldn’t have a memorial service due to social distancing.

“People can’t properly grieve right now,” Floyd said. “It’s almost like, you have to just keep moving the same way you were before because if you sit still and think about it, you’re going to lose it.”

But researchers working on toxic stress have also identified the ways to bolster resiliency for kids facing adversity.

“The one factor that keeps coming out is having one adult in their life who is positive, a ray of sunshine for them,” Buttross said. “One person who encourages them and helps them along … Somebody out there who says, ‘You’re good. You’re smart. You’re awesome. You can do something.’”

“It might not be a parent,” she added. “It might be a grandparent or a teacher.”

Or a volunteer at the after-school program.

Ainsworth, the local Boys and Girls Club CEO, said she herself grew up in government housing with a single mom and eight siblings in Norfolk, Virginia.

“My four blocks of the world did not define who I was and who I was going to be. That’s my desire for my Boys and Girls Club babies,” Ainsworth said. “I need them to know that this situation that you’re in right now, it may be bleak. But if we look to your future, we keep exposing you (to opportunity) … through workforce development, college tours, and those things, the sky is the limit for you too.”

Simultaneously, the pandemic has also produced a flood of resources and people called to help.

“Hopefully those people that are in need realize that there is almost an influx of support right now,” Floyd said.

This extends beyond the help that has come with federal pandemic relief packages, such as large investments in internet connectivity and devices for school children, increased food and unemployment benefits and extra money for housing assistance.

Jackson Public Schools received a nearly 70% increase in its annual McKinney-Vento grant to serve homeless students, some of whom also receive services at Stewpot. Faith Strong, the district’s coordinator for homeless services, said she hopes to hire more social workers who can work more directly to address individual students’ needs.

The Mississippi Food Network partnered with the district to distribute family food boxes with enough fresh and frozen foods to last a family several days. The Boys and Girls Club, the City of Jackson and Meals on Wheels partnered initially and delivered roughly 20,000 meals across the city.

“There were just churches with lines out in front of them handing out boxes to whoever showed up,” Floyd said. “I’ve been proud to watch as it’s happened.”

Even before the pandemic hit, Dole Packaged Foods, a subsidiary one of the world’s largest fruit and vegetable producers headquartered in California, chose Jackson as the first city it would bring its Sunshine for All program aimed at fighting food insecurity. The company called Mississippi’s capital city one of the largest food deserts in the nation. Dole partnered with the Boys and Girls Club and has been hosting a farmer’s market at the Capitol Street unit, where people can purchase fresh produce from local Footprint Farms.

“Me and my daughter have really benefitted from being able to come and give back on a Saturday, as well as the meals. It has been a big help to me, cause I’m a single parent,” said Ebony Yarn, a Club employee and volunteer. “I fall in the gap where I make too much to get assistance but then I don’t make enough, per se, to handle everything I need to do.”

Dole is also supporting local food hub Up in Farms’ Farm-to-Table Training Center and providing 1,000 meals to the needy; launching a virtual cooking camp that teaches kids about nutrition and cooking; and building community gardens at Boys and Girls Club locations.

“It’s truly unfair that the kids here in Jackson are limited in fresh fruits and vegetables or opportunities to go into a store and get it and it just came from the vine,” Ainsworth said, “but yet if they go down the street to Madison County, the food is being washed as it’s set down, you know? It’s fresh.”

The poverty rate in Jackson is about eight times higher than the 3.3% poverty rate in the city of Madison. For Ainsworth, these food programs are about more than nutrition.

“What I want to do is make sure that we are exposing our kids to knowing that you are worthy of any and everything that you desire,” she said.","The Jackson Public Schools students cannot attend their regular elementary schools, which closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

125,"Oct 2, 2020",Wiley,Food Insecurity during COVID‐19,"For a decade, Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG) has provided sub‐state‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children. Along with being extensively used by food banks, it is widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. In this paper, we describe the methods underpinning MMG, detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020, and how food insecurity rates may have changed due to COVID‐19 since 2018. We project an increase of 17 million Americans who are food insecure in 2020 but this aggregate increase masks substantial geographic variation found in MMG.

Introduction This year represents the tenth anniversary of Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG). On an annual basis, MMG provides county‐ and congressional district‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children and, upon request, subcounty‐level results at, for example, the zip code level. Along with being extensively used by food banks to direct scarce resources to those most in need, it is now widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. For MMG, food insecurity rates are calculated with an imputation method that uses information from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Since the Core Food Security Module (CSFM) is in the December CPS and the resulting data is not publicly released until September of the following year and the ACS is not released until December, this has meant that MMG, released in the spring, is based on data that is roughly eighteen months old. Given that post‐Great Recession, rates have remained relatively stable from year to year, as have geographical differences within and across states, this release schedule has not produced issues regarding timeliness. Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018. In this article, after describing the methods underpinning MMG, we detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020 and how this may differ from 2018. Central to these projections is that the methods used in MMG allow for us to do this when information about predictions of the underlying variables are available. We then turn to a description of multiple aspects of this changed geography of food insecurity.

Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children). Examples of survey questions include: Did you or the other adults in your household ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?. Were you ever hungry but did not eat because you could not afford enough food? and Did a child in the household ever not eat for a full day because you could not afford enough food? (the most severe question). (For the complete set of questions, see Coleman‐Jensen et al. 2019.) The responses for some of these questions are yes or no. In other cases, respondents are asked if something happened never, sometimes, or often. A response of sometimes or often is counted as an affirmative response. Other questions ask respondents if something happened almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only one or two months. A response of almost every month or some months but not every month is counted as an affirmative response. Based on these responses, households are delineated into three categories: A household is said to be food secure if they respond affirmatively to two or fewer questions; low food secure if they respond affirmatively to three to seven questions (three to five questions for households without children); and very low food secure if they respond affirmatively to eight or more questions (six or more questions for households without children). Food insecure households are those without access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household. The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity. Methods We proceed in two steps to estimate the extent of food insecurity in each county (congressional district). Step 1 FI st = α + β UN UN st + β POV POV st + β MI MI st + β HISP HISP st + β BLACK BLACK st + β own OWN st + β DSBL DSBL st + μ t + υ s + ε st (1) where s is a state, t is year, UN is the unemployment rate, POV is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate, MI is median income, HISP is the percentage of Hispanics, BLACK is the percentage of African Americans, OWN is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners, DSBL is the percentage of individuals who report a disability, μ t is a year fixed effect, υ s is a state fixed effect, and ε st is an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Using state‐level data from 2009 to 2018, we estimate a model where the food insecurity rate for individuals at the state level is determined by the following equation:whereis a state,is year,is the unemployment rate,is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate,is median income,is the percentage of Hispanics,is the percentage of African Americans,is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners,is the percentage of individuals who report a disability,is a year fixed effect,is a state fixed effect, andis an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Our choice of variables was first guided by the literature on the determinants of food insecurity. We included variables that have been found in prior research to influence the probability of a household being food insecure. (For an overview of that literature in this context see Gundersen and Ziliak 2018.) While the food insecurity measure is defined at the household level, we assume all members of a food‐insecure household are food insecure, consistent with the approach found in, e.g., table 1 of Coleman‐Jensen et al. (2019). Next, we chose variables that are available both in the CPS and the ACS. Table 1.

The variables POV, MI, HISP, BLACK, OWN, and DISBL are based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures and UN is based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. We use the coefficient estimates from Step 1 plus information on the same variables defined at the county level to generate estimated food‐insecurity rates for individuals defined at the county level. This can be expressed in the following equation:wheredenotes a county. The variables, andare based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures andis based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. This year for MMG we made two primary changes. First, we added the percent of the population that has a disability to reflect the profound impact that disability status has on food insecurity. (See, e.g., Balistreri 2019; Brucker and Coleman‐Jensen 2017; Noonan, Corman, and Reichman 2016; Sonik et al. 2016.) Second, the poverty variable now only includes nonundergraduate students. This is because the true resources available to undergraduates are, on average, not reflected in the poverty rate. Consistent with this are the much lower food insecurity rates among college students in comparison to noncollege students of similar ages (Gundersen 2021). The above methods allow us to establish a base measure of food insecurity for all counties for the full population and for children. Using this base measure, we establish what we believe will happen to food insecurity in the US in 2020 because of the COVID‐19 pandemic. To do so, we consider what will occur if two of the variables in the model above, the unemployment rate and the poverty rate, increase along the lines predicted by expert opinions. (The other variables in our model are unlikely to change due to COVID‐19.) In our most recent estimates of the upper‐bound impact (as of July 13, 2020), we have assumed that the annual average unemployment rate will increase to 11.5% (up 7.6% compared to 2018) and the poverty rate will increase to 16.6% (up 4.8% compared to 2018). When we wrote the first version of this paper, there had not been expert projections of changes in poverty rates due to COVID‐19, so we assumed that the proportional change in the poverty rate viz. the unemployment rate would be roughly the same as during the Great Recession. To put this into terms of equation (2), we assume the value of UN C will increase (on average) by 0.076 and the value of POV c will increase by 0.048. This increase in the unemployment rate, though, is unlikely to be uniform across all counties in the US Instead, certain industries and occupations will be disproportionately affected by COVID‐19. So, we further adjust the county‐level and CD‐level unemployment projections for the proportion of the population that is likely to lose their jobs, combining data from the American Community Survey with estimates established in Hatzius et al. (2020).

Findings At the national level, we project 54 million food insecure Americans in 2020, approximately 17 million higher than in 2018. For children, the food insecurity rates are projected to increase to 18 million, up nearly 7 million from 2018. These national estimates, though, mask substantial heterogeneity across the country in terms of the projected impacts of COVID‐19. This is not unexpected, given the geographic diversity in the base models for both the full population (figure 1) and children (figure 2). Looking at states, the highest five states are the same whether or not COVID‐19 occurred—Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. However, there are some states that will see much higher food insecurity rates. Nevada stands out—pre‐COVID‐19 it would have been twentieth, but post‐COVID‐19 it is projected to be eighth. For children, Louisiana and New Mexico are first and second with or without COVID‐19, but Nevada is now third (ninth without COVID‐19). The substantially higher projected rates for Nevada are primarily due to their reliance on service sector jobs, which have been disproportionately affected by COVID‐19.

[Color figure can be viewed at [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com One of the key contributions from MMG is its portrayal of the substantial heterogeneity in local food insecurity that is seen in figures 1 and 2. The responses to COVID‐19 will also vary based on geography, although, consistent with the state results, there is likely to be some similarities in terms of county rankings. For the full population (table 1), we display, first, the fifteen counties with the highest rates of food insecurity in the base case and due to our projections. In the base case, the fifteen counties are all in the South or counties with Indian Reservations. The highest is Jefferson County, Mississippi (30.4%) and the fifteenth is Harlan County, Kentucky (24.8%). Without the adjustments for county‐level differences in unemployment rates described above, these would be the same orderings after COVID‐19 but, due to these adjustments, there are some differences. The five highest remain the same but, for example, Washington County, Mississippi and Wolfe County, Kentucky are now in the top fifteen. In the final two column of table 1 we display the projected percent increases in food insecurity for the highest fifteen counties. These are all counties with base rates that are relatively low, which is the reason for the substantial increases. The increases range from 157.3% in the highest (Burke County, North Dakota) to 109.5% in the fifteenth highest (Daggett County, Utah). These dramatic increases may be one reason for why some food banks reported being especially strained in response to COVID‐19. Table 2 has the same structure as table 1 but for children. As expected, there is overlap in counties between the two. For example, Kusilvak Census Area in Alaska is second highest for children and fourth highest for the full population for both the base case and the rankings after COVID‐19. There are some contrasts, though, insofar as Texas has no counties in the top fifteen for the full population but has four in the base case for children and four in the COVID‐19 projections. In terms of projected percent increases for children, there are some differences with the full population. While North Dakota has ten of the fifteen highest counties for the full population, they have two for children and, conversely, Virginia has one in the full population but six for children including the top three. The range of the percent increase is also higher and wider—from 143.6% for the fifteenth (Kendall County, Illinois) to 363.0% to the highest (Falls Church City, Virginia). (An Excel file with the full set of results for the full population and children including the projected proportional changes and the adjustment for unemployment rate is in the Appendix.) Table 2.

Conclusion The proceeding discussion—and the full set of results with updates as needed at http://map.feedingamerica.org/—provides an overview of the geographic diversity in food insecurity rates across the U.S. and what may happen due to COVID‐19. We conclude with three main points. First, while these projections of increased food insecurity rates are of great concern, they would have been for worse were it not for the resiliency of the agricultural supply chain in the face of COVID‐19. (For more on this, see the other articles in this Special Issue.) Given that food prices are a key determinant of food insecurity (e.g., Gregory and Coleman‐Jensen 2013; Courtemanche et al. 2019), if there had been price increases due to agricultural supply chain breakdowns, the food insecurity rates we have estimated would have been much higher. In other words, the projected increase in food insecurity is due to projected increases in unemployment and poverty and not problems within the agricultural sector. Future researchers may wish to consider why this success occurred and, in particular, the protections it afforded vulnerable persons. Second, our estimates are based on information from annual food insecurity measures for the full calendar year instead of food insecurity measures that are based on either shorter time frames (e.g., the previous thirty days) and or across years. In addition, these estimates are based on the full set of eighteen questions on the CFSM. Three other papers in this Special Issue employ other methods to ascertain the impact of COVID‐19 on food insecurity and, as such, our results are not directly comparable. (See Ahn and Norwood 2021; Restrepo, Rabbitt, and Gregory 2021: and Ziliak 2021.) Third, the accuracy of our projections will not become evident until September 2021 for the national results and March 2022 for the MMG estimates. We look forward to ascertaining the success (or lack of success) of our projections at that time.

Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018.
Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children).
The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity.
Second, our estimates are based on information from annual food insecurity measures for the full calendar year instead of food insecurity measures that are based on either shorter time frames (e.g., the previous thirty days) and or across years."

127,"Jan 31, 2019",Mississippi Today,"Clarksdale ‘brought home the bacon,’ and landed a new grocer seen as vital to the Delta town’s economy","CLARKSDALE – Like many rural Delta towns, this community of 16,000 battles with poverty related issues and limited access to fresh high quality foods is a top concern for many. Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

But, now city officials have announced a new grocer will come into the city, bringing healthy, fresh eats to the residents and neighboring counties.

“Last year, if you all remember, we were pulling out our handkerchiefs and saying goodbye to a grocery store player that had been here for decades, and many of us felt that loss,” said Jon Levingston, executive director of the Clarksdale/Coahoma County Chamber of Commerce.

“Today, we got the promise of a new wonderful grocery store, a new choice to buy quality food for our citizens here in Clarksdale. … Every community that is economically and financially sustainable has choices — choices in housing, choices in grocery stores, good jobs … and this is one more piece in an economic puzzle that allows us to create a sustainable, financial platform for Clarksdale.”

Over the past year, citizens feared the town would not secure another grocery store after the departure of Kroger, a primary option for residents. Many were in disbelief upon hearing news of its closing. Kroger officials cited that profits were declining at the Clarksdale store.

But the Kroger here was profitable, said Mayor Chuck Espy, adding that their year-end balance sheet indicated the store produced $17 million in revenue. Rather it was the corporation changing “their business model to depart from rural communities that look like Clarksdale or Third Street in Memphis,” that resulted in store shutting its doors, he said.

“(Places) where there were people who didn’t have a large discretionary dollar, where there was poverty or high minority population, they pulled out of those communities,” said Espy. “I understand from a corporate aspect, they’re looking for higher profit margin … but pulling out of areas that is designated as a food desert is devastating to a community.”

Clarksdale wasn’t the only town to lose its Kroger. Two other stores in Memphis closed. And a host of other Kroger locations have closed within the past year, several media outlets reported.

The closing here has had an economic impact on the city. Sales taxes have plummeted. In just the past four months, sales tax revenue was down $54,000, said Cathy Clark, Clarksdale city clerk. Online shopping and the loss of Kroger are the two primary factors, officials say.

Last year alone, sale tax revenue was down $125,000. But despite the decrease in revenue and declining population, Clarksdale leaders see new developments like Piggly Wiggly, as a way to grow the community, create more jobs, and bring in more revenue.

Dwan “Dee” Brown, economic developer of P3 Group, Inc., announced the building of the new Piggly Wiggly that will create about 75 jobs, at the mayor and board of commissioners January meeting.

Instead of moving into the old Kroger building, Brown, who’s spearheading the $39 million Corey L. Moore Sports and Recreational Complex in Clarksdale, said that Piggly Wiggly will be located at the complex site.

“As mayor, I’ve been in negotiations with three other entities to take over Kroger. Every entity thought the footprint was too large of a grocery chain,” said Espy in a phone call with Mississippi Today. “(Grocery chains are) moving away from big box stores and moving to smaller intimate stores.”

Brown echoed the mayor, adding that after conducting a market study, the results indicated that equipment, such as HVAC systems and coolers, in the former Kroger dated back to 1981 and the newest in 2001. It would be more costly to move out the old equipment, bring in new equipment, upgrade electrical work, among other things, he said.

The closest Piggly Wiggly to Clarksdale is about 38 miles north in Batesville. But unlike other Piggly Wiggly supermarkets, this one will be tailored specifically to Clarksdale’s culture: focusing on the blues.

“The new store will basically be a blues city Piggly Wiggly. It’ll be more than a shopping experience, it’ll be a cultural experience for those who come and visit,” said Brown. “It’ll be designed to capture the culture and heritage of Clarksdale.”

Blues music will not only reach customers ears when they walk in, but the interior design will reflect the blues culture, said Brown.

Aside from the grocery store, other amenities include a fuel center, a loyalty program to tie rewards from shopping to fuel purchases, curbside pickup for groceries, and delivery services to retirement homes and Coahoma Community College students. Brown noted that CCC students can apply for work study jobs at Piggly Wiggly that will be subsidized by the operations, which means revenue from the store will provide additional funds for students to have work study jobs.

Building the store will cost around $4 million and the fuel center will cost around $500,000, said Brown. They are looking to secure new market tax credits for the project. The sports complex along with the Piggly Wiggly will start the building phase in tandem.

If the process goes as planned, Brown said he hopes to break ground on the public infrastructure in May, construct buildings in August, and open around January or February in 2020.

“We have looked at this area for quite some time, and we know that there’s a need for a grocery store here in this area where you don’t have to go out of town and spend three hours round trip out of your day,” said Tim Chaffin, sales manager of Piggly Wiggly in Alabama at the meeting.

“Piggly Wiggly is not a cookie cutter concept. You can’t drop this store in Nashville, Tenn., or Atlanta, Ga., and it have the same feel. …This is an original.”

Chaffin said that a project of this magnitude is not as easy as putting something on a shelf. He said there is a preliminary site plan in place, but this is time consuming due to putting infrastructure in place and building the store.

Piggly Wiggly is a grocery wholesaler who partners with independent owners, operators, and economic developers. This particular store is a partnership between Brown, his partners CORE Construction and Chasm Architecture, and Piggly Wiggly representatives.

Like this rural town, there have been other communities seeking grocery store options. Another small town in Mississippi, Gloster, struggled with getting one for decades. Finally, they were able to bring a Piggly Wiggly to their town.

The issue of limited access to grocery stores is all too common in rural areas across the state. Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Coahoma County, where Clarksdale is located, has one of the highest food insecurity rates in the state at 31 percent, eleven percent above the state average, according to data from Feeding America.

Though many citizens here were ecstatic about a new grocery store coming in, others questioned the location of the store via social media. A Mississippi Today reporter announcement of the store on Facebook, received 120 shares, 96 comments, and 176 reactions.

Residents argued it would be a hassle to get to the Piggly Wiggly location. Brown noted the distance of citizens driving to Piggly Wiggly versus citizens traveling to the former Kroger store is about a mile and a half for both.

Although the announcement came Monday, officials hope to have a ribbon cutting around this time next year.

“I have to say that I can’t pass this opportunity without saying, ‘Mr. mayor, board of commissioners, Tim, Dwan, y’all have really brought home the bacon, haven’t you?” said Levingston.

“They don’t call it Piggly Wiggly for nothing.”","Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

129,"Aug 13, 2020",Northside Sun,A conversation with Martha Allen on works of Extra Table,"Extra Table is all about fighting food insecurity in Mississippi by stocking food pantries across the state with healthy foods. Martha Allen, whose career has primarily been in the non-profit realm, took over as executive director of Extra Table in March 2018. Allen recently spoke with Sun Staff Writer Nikki Rowell about the mission of Extra Table, and how the organization has been impacted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

What is the mission of Extra Table?

“Extra Table is the amazing partnership launched by well-known restaurateur Robert St. John, in 2009, making a difference in the lives of Mississippians by fundraising in order to stock food pantries and soup kitchens across the state with wholesome nutritious food.”

When did you become the executive director? What do you do in this role?

“March of 2018. I’ve been here a little over two and a half years, and on a daily basis I’m communicating with our food pantries and fundraising daily. We strictly fundraise in order to purchase new and healthy foods that we distribute monthly to our food pantries and soup kitchens throughout the state of Mississippi. Our goal is to fight hunger and obesity hand-in-hand, since Mississippi is at the top of both of those lists. We can make a difference when fighting those systematically and together.

Our food is always shelf stable, so low sodium soups, low sodium vegetables, fruit in 100 percent juice, lots of lean protein like tuna, beans, peanut butter and great whole grains, like oatmeal, granola bars, grits, pasta and rice.”

Since Mississippi has a problem with food insecurity and, in turn, obesity, can you talk a bit about the importance of not only getting food to the hungry in Mississippi, but how Extra Table goes a step further to ensure that the food is healthy?

“When Robert St. John formed Extra Table in 2009, he founded it on two principles, that when we fundraise for food, all the money goes to food. Our administrative costs are raised separately. The second principle is that 100 percent of our food is always going to be healthy. So, we ship food that is not processed.

We know that there are so many people in Mississippi with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease. When they don’t have a choice of where to go for food, we want our food to offer hope and be respectful and to support whatever health concern they’re dealing with. So, when a lady enters the pantry with high blood pressure or diabetes, we want our food to help her condition, not harm her condition or add to it.

We know that in a rural state like Mississippi, access to grocery stores is tough with the average distance to a grocery store being 30 miles in many places. So, food accessibility and affordability is critical. It’s definitely easier to run through a drive-through versus having food at home to prepare.”

Can you walk me through how the process works as far as how Extra Table facilitates getting the food and getting it to these facilities?

“Yes, it’s four easy steps. Step one, we fundraise. Step two, we purchase. Step three, we distribute to food pantries and soup kitchens. And step four, people are fed. It seems like a difficult concept, but it’s based on a really simple idea that is extremely efficient and effective, allowing us to get the best quality foods to the most people. We don’t participate in canned food drives. We strictly fundraise in order to buy food.

We’re really excited that throughout COVID our support has gone up and our reach has broadened. We are now able to say that $1 feeds 5.9 healthy meals.”

What are some of the organizations Extra Table works with in the Jackson metro?

“Working Together Jackson, Good Samaritan, MadCAAP, StewPot, Midtown Partners, Central United Methodist Church, Operation Upward, the Boys and Girls Club, Spring Forth Opportunity, Grace House and Galloway Mission are just to name a few.”

How many people benefit from this each year?

“Over 500,000 meals are provided annually.”

How badly is Mississippi affected by food insecurity?

“There are 680,000 Mississippians that struggle with hunger, so one in five Mississippians. Those numbers are prior to COVID-19.”

Has COVID-19 had an impact on Extra Table, as far as leading to more people needing its services?

“We are seeing a 30 to 50 percent increase in requests for food at our food pantries and soup kitchens. Immediately when COVID hit and grocery store shelves became scarce and food became a little more expensive, we realized that we had to evaluate our process in order to ensure that food would be coming in the future months. We kind of went back to the drawing board and had a whole new way of purchasing and shipping our food. We’re saving an additional 30 percent. In the face of a global pandemic, we’ve learned lessons and improved our system that was already efficient and effective.

We are excited about that. We have partnered with Good Sam in Jackson and got the hub for the hungry, where we have been rescuing food and putting it on refrigerated and freezer trucks there so that we can distribute it to our partners as the need arises or as they’re able to come get it so that food doesn’t go to waste. Our goal is to have zero food go to waste on our watch. We’ve partnered with farmers like Two Brooks Rice, so we have Mississippi-grown rice that we are distributing to our food pantries and soup kitchens.

We have an apartment complex, Heritage Properties in Hattiesburg, that is renovating and donating their freezers and refrigerators to us to distribute to our food pantries and soup kitchens. We’re working with a group of fishermen on the Mississippi Gulf Coast to get another source of great protein out to our pantries and soup kitchens. We’ve been working with the Community Foundation for Mississippi and the Community Foundation for Washington County, both through grants and food box programs, in order to provide more food for Mississippians.

And we were so grateful for the businesses in the Jackson metro and the Junior League ladies for their support in our COVID efforts and fighting hunger.”

What about on the fundraising side? Have you guys had to cancel fundraising events? If so, how have you been able to bridge the gap in donations?

“Yes. Within the first month, we lost anywhere from $75,000 to $100,000 in events. The spring is a busy time for all nonprofits. As the fall ramps back up, we have had to cancel many things and transfer them and learn how they translate into virtual events or drive through, contactless events. It is a daily learning curve. We’re working really hard, and we are so grateful that our donors believe in the work we do and believe in telling the Extra Table story. We’re blessed and know we are going to be able to continue feeding people during this pandemic.

In the face of a global pandemic, not only have we been able to provide better food, but more food to each of our food pantries. In the height of the pandemic, we were providing food weekly, and we have gone back to monthly now. But it is a much, much larger load. We are thrilled.”

Does Extra Table rely more on individual donations or businesses?

“It is a 50/50 mix. It is a beautiful mix of businesses and individuals that are passionate and know that nutrition is so valuable at all stages of our lives, that if children don’t have good nutrition in early childhood development we know their brain doesn’t fully develop and that is not something that they can catch back up on. We know for students in the classroom that if they’re hungry they’re not paying attention and they’re not listening. Further up, we know hunger is a huge problem on college campuses. Then, for adults, it is difficult for adults to maintain a job and maintain safety and continue to report to work day after day if they are extremely food insecure or struggling with hunger.

Extra Table is proud to be a partner that helps put food on the table in homes throughout Mississippi. It’s healthy food. It’s the same stuff our donors would want to go home at night and eat. We provide new, shelf-stable food all over the state of Mississippi.”

130,"Jun 9, 2020",CNN,Groceries were hard to find for millions. Now it's getting even worse,"New York (CNN Business) The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and limited delivery slots for online groceries.

But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

In 2015, an estimated 39 million people, or 12.8% of the US population, lived in ""low income and low access areas,"" according to the USDA's most recent data

The areas are defined as those where a ""significant"" portion of the population lives more than a mile from the nearest supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles away in rural areas. The poverty rate is either 20% or greater, or the median-family income is below or equal to 80% of the statewide median family income.

Such areas are commonly known as food deserts, even though the term has no official meaning. it's increasingly difficult for the people who live in them to buy food.

During the pandemic, grocers have cut back their operating hours. Public transportation has been reduced, and riders who once traveled to stores in other neighborhoods or cities can no longer do so. Some older or higher-risk populations are fearful of traveling during the pandemic.

There's also evidence that food accessibility challenges are growing. In Georgia, the number of residents now living in ""food insecure"" areas has jumped 69% since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data firm Urban Footprint. The firm uses an index, including jobless claims, pre-existing health conditions, and access to grocery stores and healthy food, to measure food security — or ""reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritionally adequate food.""

In Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky the number of residents living in food insecure areas has spiked 43%, 36% and 118% respectively, driven by the rise in unemployment, according to the analysis

The pandemic has made it ""very cumbersome"" to buy groceries, said Yolanda Jackson, who lives 1.6 miles from her nearest grocery store in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2018, 23.5% of Baltimore residents lived in an area where access to healthy food is limited.

Jackson usually takes the bus to Shoppers grocery store, but stopped during the pandemic in part because of the long waits. She has been going to corner stores and bodegas ""where the selections are low and the prices are high,"" she said.

""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data.

'Online grocery shopping is not equal'

Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce, public health experts say.

Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.

""With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than processed items,"" said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes.

During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online.

Amazon AMZN Walmart WMT In states that do allow recipients to use their benefits online, their options are usually onlyor, which have gaps in where they deliver groceries to customers' home. And some deliveries have minimum purchase requirements or added shipping fees, which can be a barrier for low-income customers.

""Access to online grocery shopping is not equal,"" said Caitlin Caspi, assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Rep. Sanford Bishop, chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Subcommittee, wrote to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue last week urging the department to expand the number of grocers eligible to participate in the online program. ""Of the approved retailers, only two are national chains and only one of the national retailers can reach our most rural communities,"" Bishop said.

As food access challenges swell during the pandemic, cities, food banks, schools and community organizations are trying to find creative solutions.

""The public school system and many charter and private schools are continuing to offer meals to children and some of our urban farmers and chefs are teaming up to make meals for people in their neighborhoods who are in need of food,"" said Winona Bynum from the Detroit Food Policy Council.

In Baltimore, the city has developed an emergency response strategy. It's working to expand residents' participation in the food stamp program, which allows for online purchasing in the state of Maryland. The city has also ramped up delivering boxes of shelf-stable groceries and produce to residents' homes.","But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

Nine years into the economic recovery, roughly one in eight U.S. households still struggle to get enough food to eat, at least occasionally, but the longer-term trend has been marked by gradual improvement.

Some 11.8 percent of American households — and slightly more in Arizona — were deemed ""food insecure,"" according to a report released Sept. 5 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

That definition means one or more members of these households faced some period during 2017 when their food intake was reduced and eating patterns disrupted, usually because of a lack of money.

Slightly more Arizonan households, 13.1 percent, were food insecure, placing the state in 18th place in this dubious measure. States were evaluated over a different three-year span, covering 2015 to 2017.

Neighboring New Mexico had the nation's highest rate of household food insecurity at 17.9 percent, followed by four Southern states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Hawaii had the lowest rate, 7.4 percent of households, slightly better than New Jersey and North Dakota.

Arizona improved from 12th place, and a 14.9 percent rate of food insecurity, in an earlier study covering 2013-15.

Occasional struggles

Authors of the report noted that most Americans don't face hunger throughout the year.

""When households experience very low food security in the United States, the resulting instances of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns are usually occasional or episodic, but not usually chronic,"" they said.

Nevertheless, Melissa Boteach, a senior vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, cited the report as evidence that ""far too many Americans, especially households with children, are struggling to put food on the table.""

In a statement, she attacked President Donald Trump for downplaying poverty and urged the White House to adopt policies such as a higher national minimum wage.

The latest 11.8 percent food-insecurity level marked an improvement from 12.3 percent in 2016. After peaking at 14.9 percent in 2011, in the wake of the recession, the rate has declined for six straight years. It hasn't dropped below 10 percent for the past two decades. It stood at 11.1 percent at the outset of the recession in 2007.

Jerry Brown, a spokesman for St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix, agreed that food insecurity has alleviated somewhat in Arizona recently, allowing his group to serve high-risk groups that the organization wasn't able to connect with earlier.

""We have been able to expand because we haven't been in an all-hands-on-deck situation, manning the lines to get food to people in need,"" he said.

Examples of St. Mary's expanded outreach include sending mobile-pantry trucks into high-need neighborhoods in the town of Guadalupe and the Maryvale community in west Phoenix and delivering food to public school systems on tribal reservations in northern Arizona.

High-risk groups

The latest study incorporated survey responses from more than 37,000 households, with help from the Census Bureau.

Nationally, 30.8 percent of people living below the poverty level dealt with food insecurity last year. Other groups with high rates included African-Americans (21.8 percent), Hispanics (18 percent) and households with children (15.7 percent), including those headed by a single woman (30.3 percent) or single man (19.7 percent).

Arizona has an above-average rate of food insecurity involving children, Brown said, citing information from another study. ""We still have about 400,000 kids facing food insecurity (in Arizona), but we're getting better,"" he said.

About three in five food-insecure households took advantage of one or more of the three main federal food assistance programs — SNAP or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps), the National School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

132,"Sep 15, 2020",The Counter,Study: 29 million American adults don’t have enough to eat—a threefold increase since 2018,"Months into the pandemic, an American hunger crisis has exploded, with tens of millions of people suddenly wondering if they will be able to put food on the table.

According to a new report commissioned by the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), as of July, the number of people who said they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat has skyrocketed to 29 million, or 11 percent of adults in the United States. (By comparison, 8 million adults, or around 4 percent, did not have enough to eat in 2018.) In 38 states and Washington, D.C., more than one in ten adults with children had inadequate amounts of food, with the highest rates of hunger in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.

As expected, people of color and those without a college education were more likely to go hungry. The pandemic has exacerbated their vulnerabilities: More than 20 percent of Black and Latinx families reported they did not have enough to eat, which is double the rate of whites. Women, who were more likely to have lost their jobs, also reported higher rates of hunger.

Now, new data from the Census Bureau, referenced in the report, shows that even America’s middle class is now reckoning with hunger. Two years ago, only 3 percent of adults earning between $50,000 and $75,000 a year said they did not have enough to eat; during the pandemic, that rose to 8 percent. Similarly, 5 percent of adults earning between $35,000 and $50,000 reported that hunger in 2018; now, it is 12 percent.","Months into the pandemic, an American hunger crisis has exploded, with tens of millions of people suddenly wondering if they will be able to put food on the table.
