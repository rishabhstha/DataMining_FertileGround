STARKVILLE, Miss.— Mississippi State President Mark E. Keenum congratulates the United Nations World Food Programme for receiving the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, which was announced Friday [Oct. 9] by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

In addition to MSU’s partnerships with the United Nations and the World Food Programme, Keenum’s professional background and national leadership in promoting global food security have facilitated numerous engagements with the organization. In 2016, Keenum wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating the World Food Programme for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“I would like to personally congratulate the World Food Programme and its outstanding executive director, David Beasley, on this well-earned recognition,” Keenum said. “As the Norwegian Nobel Committee noted, addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world. That is why organizations like the World Food Programme are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

Members of MSU’s leadership team met with Beasley and other United Nations leaders last November in Rome, Italy, to discuss solutions to 21st century challenges such as food insecurity and hunger. In 2014, MSU signed an agreement with the World Food Programme that focuses on cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development.

Keenum serves as chairman of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development. A three-time MSU agricultural economics graduate, he has focused a significant portion of his career on global food security. In addition to his BIFAD appointment, he is chairman of the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. He has twice spoken at the United Nations in New York about the roles public research universities play in addressing critical food and agricultural challenges. Prior to returning to his alma mater, Keenum served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Serving as MSU’s president since 2009, Keenum has helped enhance the university’s standing as a leading agricultural research university. The most recent National Science Foundation survey shows MSU is ranked No. 11 nationally with $105 million in research and development expenditures in agricultural sciences. MSU is leading the USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, in addition to other national and international collaborations aimed at helping feed a global population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050.

1,"Nov 23, 2020",,"Survey: Food Insecurity, Lack of Support Remain Top Challenges for Mississippians Receiving SNAP","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic. A new state survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients finds that Mississippi families need help with food, housing and utilities, especially since government assistance for many families expired earlier this year.

The survey was released by the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP). It found that 66 percent of those surveyed were having trouble buying enough food at some point during the pandemic. Child care issues were cited by 32 percent and the loss of jobs were also cited by 29 percent.

“Food security was a challenge for many Mississippians well before the pandemic, whether it was people struggling to make ends meet in low wage work or who lacked access to fresh food where they lived,” said Sara Miller, policy analyst at the Hope Policy Institute. “As the pandemic brings these issues to a crisis point, families and communities need both near-term recovery efforts and improvements to food systems in our state overall.”

Government assistance has made a real difference, with 51 percent of respondents saying programs or assistance helped. But most of that aid has expired. Organizations like the SPLC Action Fund, Hope Policy Institute, Children’s Defense Fund, Hope Delta and Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Mississippi, Mississippi Center for Justice and the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative are calling for the state and federal government to take these concerns into account and move immediately to provide more assistance.

“What this survey shows is that people need help,” said Brandon Jones, Mississippi policy director for the SPLC Action Fund. “We need the government, both at the state and federal level, to do more to help the people who are suffering because of the pandemic.”

Of the 12 Southern states surveyed, Mississippi was the only state to have SNAP and P-EBT application issues as the greatest challenges. All other Southern states had problems with unemployment insurance or stimulus checks as the top challenge. The share of Mississippi respondents who had problems applying for or receiving SNAP was 10 percentage points higher than the share for all Southern respondents (23% vs. 13%).

“The pandemic has exacerbated poverty in Mississippi and the need for holistic systems of support is urgent,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative. “Mississippians need access to food, child care, housing and employment assistance to rebuild their economic security. Mississippians who received pandemic unemployment benefits were priced out of SNAP and consequently lost food assistance, a glaring example of our fractured safety net.”

The data came from 297 anonymized surveys in Mississippi in August and September. Respondents were invited to answer a mixture of multiple choice and open-ended questions about challenges and changes in the wake of the pandemic, experiences using and applying for government benefits, and recommendations and requests for policymakers.","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic.

2,"Aug 7, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Hundreds arrested in ICE raids at Mississippi food processing plants,"CLOSE Gov. Phil Bryant on Monday signed into law a measure that would prevent local governments and universities enacting policies that would limit enforcement of and cooperation with federal immigration laws and enforcement.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents executed search warrants at food processing plants across Mississippi Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of 680 people.

They occurred in small towns near Jackson with a workforce made up largely of Latino immigrants, including Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastapol. About 600 agents fanned out across the plants involving several companies, surrounding the perimeters to prevent workers from fleeing.

Matthew Albence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's acting director, told The Associated Press that the raids could be the largest such operation thus far in any single state.

In an emailed statement Wednesday morning, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations special agents are executing federal search warrants today at multiple locations across the state of Mississippi as part of a coordinated operation with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi pursuant to ongoing HSI administrative and criminal investigations.”

In a second statement, Hurst said via email, ""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country.""

Bryan Cox, ICE spokesperson, said everyone taken into custody and detained Wednesday will be processed but ""not everyone is going to be (permanently) detained.""

""You are going to have persons released,"" he said. ""ICE makes custody determination on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of their circumstances.""

The names of the plants has not been publicly released by ICE officials. However, reporters were on scene at the Koch Foods Inc. processing plant in Morton. Another included the Peco Chicken Processing Plant in Canton.

In an emailed statement, Peco Foods Inc. confirmed raids took place at three of their facilities — Canton, Bay Springs and Sebastopol. The company is ""fully cooperating"" with authorities, the statement read.

This story has been corrected since originally published to indicate the warrants were being executed on Wednesday.

3,5 days ago,GazetteNET,Food & Farm: A ‘HIP’ way to bolster food security,"A few weeks ago, I went with my friend, Kathleen Chapman — or KC, as she’s called — to the February Winter Farmers’ Market at the Northampton Senior Center.

KC is a Southerner, a smart, funny artist and teacher who moved to Northampton from Mississippi in 2019. Shopping with her is always a good reminder of how blessed western Massachusetts is with relative abundance. Mississippi is a state that consistently ranks as the most food insecure in the nation, with a good many of its residents living miles from the nearest grocery store.

KC always remarks on the plenty of the Pioneer Valley, joking sometimes that someone needs to set up a swap between this area and the South, in which the South will ship dogs to Northampton in exchange for food.

The catch, however, is that food, along with everything else, is so much more expensive here than in Mississippi. KC, who lives in senior housing downtown, uses a combination of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — what people used to know as food stamps) and Survival Center groceries to help her stretch her fixed budget. At the Farmers’ Market, she also has access to an additional tool in the form of HIP benefits.

HIP is the Healthy Incentives Program, a state- and USDA-funded program that provides monthly incentives to SNAP households when they purchase fresh local vegetables and fruit at farmers markets, mobile markets, farm shares and farm stands. HIP automatically adds back any SNAP money spent at one of the above outlets, up to a certain amount. So, for instance, the SNAP money KC spends on local produce at the Winter Market is immediately added back to her Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, and, as a household of one, she can spend up to $40 a month on local produce via HIP.

It’s not hard to see how this might benefit the health and well-being of households with limited means. Nutrition research can be fickle and biased, but to my knowledge, there is no study that argues that increasing your daily intake of vegetables will do anything but improve your health outcomes.

And people have been using HIP. Since the program began in 2017, SNAP sales at farm retail outlets increased by a whopping 1,250%; to date, 88,000 families have used their HIP incentives, 45% of whom include seniors, and 30% of whom include children.

The program has been popular enough that the state has periodically had to halt its disbursement of HIP funding because it underestimated the demand for fresh, local produce among its low-income citizens. And besides produce, HIP can also be used to purchase edible plants, so that people who have a bit of growing room can spend their HIP allowance on veggie and herb plant starts, thus increasing their access to fresh produce for an entire season.

If these were the only benefits that accrued to the community via HIP, the program would already be an asset, but its value extends beyond the customers. HIP does a good amount of legwork in the effort to create a more sustainable food system by supporting local farmers as well.

For growers, the cost of organically raising, picking, washing, packaging and distributing produce while stewarding land in a holistic, sustainable way while paying themselves and their workers a living wage is undeniably high.

According to Olivia Pettingill of Wingate Farm, the HIP program has permitted farmers like her to cover their costs while feeding a more economically diverse range of people.

“HIP has significantly enabled a more equal distribution of high-quality produce to our local community,” she says, “and it’s done this while allowing small farmers to stay in business and even thrive.”

She points out that HIP has more lasting effects as well on the kind of general thinking and public curiosity that lead to greater food security. Local farmers try to grow produce and fruits that do well in our local climate, but that doesn’t always mean growing the vegetables that are the most conventionally recognized.

HIP incentivizes people to try different kinds of veggies that are more locally sustainable, and in doing so, it builds a marketplace that relies less on foods from far-flung places, thus reducing the carbon footprint of shipping.

SNAP Match

The program is not without its issues. As mentioned, there have been periods when it shut down for lack of funding, which is confusing and frustrating for those attempting to use their benefits. This inconsistency also limits farmers’ ability to plan, as well as HIP’s ability to make a sustained difference in people’s eating habits.

Also, if you don’t have any SNAP money left on your EBT card, you can’t access your HIP benefits, even though the two amounts are not dependent on each other. And a further issue is that the benefits are pretty specific: You can buy local vegetables and fruit, but other farm products such as eggs or meat aren’t covered.

In an effort to fill that gap, Grow Food Northampton, which operates the Tuesday Farmers’ Market and the current Winter Farmers’ Market, offers SNAP Match, a system in which Grow Food matches the amount of SNAP money an individual spends at the farmers market. (SNAP Match also doubles the match for the first $10 people spend.) In this way, farmers who sell products other than veggies aren’t left out, and people doing their shopping with SNAP benefits are given a wider selection of choices.

It’s rare, I think, to find elegant solutions where food access is concerned, and even rarer when food access, environmental stewardship and the local economy work together in any kind of synergistic fashion, which is why the combination of HIP and SNAP Match — and their potential to help further a smaller, more sustainable, and more equitable food system — is so ingenious.

The majority of SNAP Match is even funded locally, by Valley Home Improvement, which, over the last four years, has doubled the amount of assistance that Grow Food can provide to customers. Steve Silverman, Valley Home Improvement’s founder, says the company is keen on supporting local business and addressing food insecurity as well — values that are complementary and aligned in SNAP Match.

While SNAP Match will continue as long as Grow Food has the money to support it, the proposed state budget for the next fiscal year cuts HIP funding from this year’s $13 million to $5 million in 2022. Given the many benefits to both local farms and families who would otherwise lack access to sustainable fresh local produce, this seems short-sighted from every angle.

Why not keep the momentum going on a program that has demonstrated great potential to positively affect the health of the commonwealth’s most disadvantaged citizens while also allowing local farm businesses to thrive and grow food in a way increases our food security and decreases our carbon footprint?

After the events of the past year, with scary disruptions to the national supply chain due to COVID, it’s in everyone’s interest to take a closer look at the steps we can take to ensure that the bounty that KC remarked upon isn’t jeopardized — and the continued funding of HIP is one of them.

KC, by the way, came away from the Winter Market with beets and onions, eggs, a small amount of bacon for cooking with some dried lima beans, and a jug of maple syrup, which she uses to sweeten her coffee — a nice balance of items good for both body and spirit.

While on occasion the complexity of figuring out the various different systems available to help her access better quality food has been frustrating, she believes absolutely in SNAP Match and HIP as valuable resources that should be funded, and not just for her own sake.

“The vegetables are so expensive at the store that I’m hesitant to buy them,” she told me, “but here [at the Farmer’s Market], I can get these delicious fresh organic vegetables, and it’s helped me a lot. And the fact that the farmers are being supported is the biggest thrill to me.”

4,"May 22, 2020",Marketplace.org,“Record levels” of food insecurity in the U.S. because of COVID-19,"At some point this year, 54 million Americans — including one in four children — may not know where their next meal is coming from.

Food insecurity is rising in every part of the United States, and will continue to throughout 2020, according to new projections out this week from Feeding America.

“These are record levels,” said Emily Engelhard, managing director of research at Feeding America, which has a nationwide network of food banks. “We have not seen food insecurity reach these levels for the length of time that food insecurity has been measured.”

Some of the biggest increases are coming in states that rely heavily on tourism, like Nevada and Hawaii, which have been hit hard by pandemic-related job-losses. And the need is only continuing to grow in the states that had the highest rates of food insecurity before the pandemic, including Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana.

“Sometimes we have a tendency to feel like the issue of food insecurity is not our issue, and that it’s far away. It’s in some other neighborhood, in some other community,” Engelhard said. “But this really shows that it’s in every single community.”

More than 37 million people were already considered food insecure before COVID-19 arrived in the U.S. and devastated the economy — and that was the lowest it had been since before the Great Recession.

Since the earliest days of the pandemic, food banks across the country have been seeing a surge in demand, something they often measure in pounds. One meal is roughly 1.2 pounds, according to Catherine D’Amato, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Before the pandemic, the Greater Boston Food Bank was distributing between 4 and 5 million pounds of food a month, on average.

In March, it distributed 8 million pounds.

In April, 9.5 million pounds.

In May, it’s on track to distribute more than 10 million pounds.

“That’s a very clear indicator that something is different,” D’Amato said. “It’s historic, we’ve never seen anything like this. So there’s no roadmap for us, and we’re kind of building it.”

Projected rates of food insecurity for 2020 by state, according to Feeding America’s report, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Security. (Courtesy Feeding America)

Around 40% of the increase is coming from people who had never been to a food bank before, according to Feeding America — people who have newly lost a job, or are supporting sick family members.

With unemployment continuing to rise every week — nearly 39 million people have applied for benefits for the first time just in the last two months — food banks know that need is only going to continue to increase, and is likely to remain high for a long time.

“Are we going to be in this for five years? Are we going to be in this for three years?” D’Amato said. “We know we’re going to be in this for multiple years simply based on these historic unemployment numbers.”

So far, there has been a surge in donations, both from individuals and corporations, that is helping food banks meet the increase in demand.

But, Engelhard said, “my concern is that this will become a new normal, and that the sort of energy and community support that we’re seeing won’t sustain, even as people continue to be in dire need of support.”

COVID-19 Economy FAQs How are those COVID relief payments affecting consumers? Payments started going out within days of President Joe Biden signing the American Rescue Plan, and that’s been a big shot in the arm for consumers, said John Leer at Morning Consult, which polls Americans every day. “Consumer confidence is really on a tear. They are growing more confident at a faster rate than they have following the prior two stimulus packages.” Leer said this time around the checks are bigger and they’re getting out faster. Now, rising confidence is likely to spark more consumer spending. But Lisa Rowan at Forbes Advisor said it’s not clear how much or how fast. Will more people be working from home once the worst of the pandemic recedes? It’s still unclear whether remote work will remain widespread, but there is at least more data analyzing the costs and benefits of working from home. People might be saving on things like commuting and buying clothes, but they’re also finding that in order to make long-term remote work feasible, they’ll have to upgrade their living spaces. And that cost could outweigh savings. Chris Stanton, a Harvard business professor, said even a minor increase in working from home after the pandemic could add up to billions of dollars a year for workers. I’m hearing a lot about interest rates. Is it getting more expensive to borrow money? Expectations of higher inflation as the economy rebounds have investors demanding higher yields to compensate. In turn, the recent surge in bond yields is pushing up the interest rates consumers pay on mortgages and other loans. Economist Scott Hoyt with Moody’s Analytics said rising rates could dampen demand for housing a little and refinancing a little more. Other kinds of consumer spending are less likely to be affected. Interest on auto loans and credit cards are pegged to shorter-term rates, which haven’t been rising as much.

6,"Nov 25, 2020",Newsweek,"Most Number of People In Need of Food This Thanksgiving Since Great Depression, Data Shows","Over 50 million Americans may be in need of food this Thanksgiving due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many states around the country are reaching Depression-era levels of hunger, according to data from nation's largest hunger-relief organization, Feeding America.

Nationally, that number equates to roughly 1 in 6 adults, and 1 in 4 children in the U.S. who are struggling to meet their basic food needs.

""The numbers are staggering,"" Eugene Cho, CEO of Bread for the World, a religious nonprofit that works to prevent food insecurity, said in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR). ""We're talking 54 million people in our backyards, in our cities, in our nation right now. That's about 1 in 6 Americans,"" he added.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted levels of food insecurity throughout the country, as millions of Americans continue to face income loss and joblessness. In June, a Northwestern University study found that food insecurity during the pandemic had doubled nationally, and tripled for households with children.

This time last year, roughly 35 million people struggled with hunger in the U.S., a number that has increased by nearly 20 million as the pandemic continues to unfold, according to Feeding America.

In a November survey conducted by the hunger relief organization, 80 percent of the 200 nationwide food banks associated with Feeding America have reported an increase in food production this year.

In total, food banks have consistently seen a 60 percent increase in demand compared to November 2019, and continue to require more food and resources to provide to people in need.

In some states, the issue reflects Depression-era levels.

In Texas, one of the hardest-hit states for COVID-19, 1 in 3 Houston households have had a serious issue affording food, and 1 in 5 do not get enough to eat every day, according to NPR.

The CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank told CNBC that his program now feeds 120,000 —or double the number of people—that they normally do. The numbers have gotten so high that they now have to ration food.

In Rhode Island, the Community Food Bank reported that one in four households struggle to put food on the table, the highest it's been since the Great Depression.

In an October report published by the University of Illinois and Feeding America, the states facing the highest levels of food insecurity include Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. In Jefferson County, Mississippi, the food insecurity rate is the highest in the country at 30.4 percent.

The issue has disproportionately effected Black, Native and Hispanic communities. According to a report from National Geographic, of the top 25 counties with the highest projected food insecurity rates, only four have a population where the majority is white.

""This is a story about racial and ethnic disparities—both food insecurity and the story of coronavirus,"" Emily Engelhard, managing director of Feeding America's research unit told National Geographic. ""The populations and geographies that started in the most disadvantageous state of food insecurity are the ones that are getting hit the hardest.""

In April, the unemployment rate during COVID-19 hit its peak at 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression, when it exceeded 25 percent.

As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country and 2020 comes to a close, Americans are pushing for Congress to pass a second round of stimulus relief to help those struggling from income loss, hunger and joblessness.

""Unless policymakers act quickly to respond to the crisis at the scale necessary, we risk the damage to the economy lasting much longer than necessary, particularly for those at the bottom who have been hit the hardest,"" a group of more than 125 economists wrote in their open letter published by the Economic Security Project on Monday.

7,"May 20, 2020",PRNewswire,Feeding America Study Projects Local Food Insecurity Rates Amid Pandemic Could Reach Up To 1 In 3 Adults And 1 In 2 Children,"CHICAGO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will have a devastating impact on people facing hunger across communities nationwide, according to a new study by Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization. This study is the first of its kind to explore how food insecurity rates at the local level may increase in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity analyzes food insecurity rates for the overall population and children by state, county and congressional district. According to the study, communities that had higher rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will continue to struggle more than other areas. Meanwhile, communities with lower rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will tend to see the largest relative increases in food insecurity as a result of the crisis.

Pre-pandemic – and according to the USDA's most recent report on food security in the U.S. – 37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life. However, a recent Feeding America analysis demonstrates that this number is likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children. That means approximately 54 million people (1 in 6 people) may experience food insecurity in 2020, including 18 million children (1 in 4 children).

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

According to The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, the states projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity among the overall population include Mississippi (24.1 percent), Arkansas (22.5 percent), Alabama (22.2 percent), Louisiana (21.7 percent) and New Mexico (20.7 percent). Meanwhile, the states projected to have the highest rates of child food insecurity include Louisiana (34.5 percent), New Mexico (33.9 percent), Nevada (32.9 percent), Mississippi (32.6 percent) and Alabama (32.4 percent). One in three children in these states will likely experience food insecurity this year.

Specific counties projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity this year are:

Jefferson County, MS (34.2 percent for overall population)

(34.2 percent for overall population) Issaquena County, MS (33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children)

(33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children) East Carrol Parish , LA (33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children)

(33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children) Kusilvak Census Area, AK (33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children)

(33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children) Holmes County, MS (32.7 percent for overall population)

(32.7 percent for overall population) Sabine County, TX (49.1 percent for children)

(49.1 percent for children) Zavala County, TX (48.9 percent for children)

Additionally, the counties that may see the highest change in food insecurity rates for the overall population are:

Burke County, ND (157 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(157 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Renville County, ND (131 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(131 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Dickey County, ND (127 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(127 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Loudoun County, VA (125 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(125 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Eagle County, CO (124 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

""More of our neighbors in these communities and beyond are relying in part on charitable food assistance to make ends meet,"" said Babineaux-Fontenot. ""As a result, food banks are facing a 'perfect storm' of surges in demand, declining food donations, fewer volunteers and disruptions to our operating procedures. Regardless of these challenges, we will continue to stay strong and resilient and work our best to help ensure our neighbors have food on the table.""

This new analysis was conducted by building upon the approach Feeding America used in two earlier briefs to predict changes to national food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to changes to poverty and unemployment. The annual projected unemployment rate (11.5%) is within close range of expert estimates when annualized, including those from a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of more than 60 economists as of May (11.6%), the Congressional Budget Office (11.4%), and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (10.3%). To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national unemployment projection for job loss due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

The underlying analysis for the food insecurity projections was conducted by Dr. Craig Gundersen using the model developed for Map the Meal Gap, Feeding America's county-level food insecurity report.

Other key findings from this report regarding the overall population include:

The projected rate of food insecurity is highest for Mississippi (24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018.

8,"May 4, 2018",Mississippi Today,Mississippi still the hungriest state,"For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

“We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.

10,"Feb 10, 2020",Center For American Progress,Trump’s Newest Budget Would Take Food Away From Working Families,"There are dozens of programs on the chopping block in the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal. Yet the administration’s most blatant attempt to gut the programs on which American families depend comes in the form of additional cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s largest nutrition assistance program. The proposed budget contains a devastating $182 billion cut to SNAP over the next decade, a reduction of approximately 28 percent compared with the baseline level estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.

SNAP is a vital support that was used by 34 million Americans in an average month in 2019, and the entire program still costs less than President Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the richest 1 percent of American households. Targeting SNAP for cuts therefore makes a negligible difference for the overall budget but does considerable harm to families. These cuts clearly demonstrate who the Trump administration prioritizes.

New research shows that despite low unemployment and other surface-level indicators of a strong economy, nearly 51 million American households—43 percent of all households—are unable to afford basic necessities such as food, transportation, and health care. There are 16.1 million American households officially in poverty, in addition to 34.7 million households who aren’t officially under the poverty line but whose low-paying jobs and high rents and health care costs mean that they must often go without basic necessities.

In a recent poll of registered voters conducted by the Center for American Progress, a staggering one-third of respondents said that, at some point over the past year, they or an immediate family member had too little money to buy food. Food insecurity is particularly prevalent for older adults; Black, Latinx, and American Indian families; and people in rural areas. For families like these, SNAP is a necessary—although often insufficient—protection against hunger.

As shown in the figures above, counties where residents use SNAP the most tend to have had the slowest economic growth and most tenuous labor market conditions. These counties took much longer to recover from the Great Recession and continue to face unemployment rates that are higher than those of the rest of the nation. At the height of the recession, these counties had an unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent, which has had long-ranging consequences for the areas’ economic stability—even a decade later.

While the Trump administration often touts a booming economy, low overall unemployment belies the differences between local conditions across the country. For example, cities such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, have unemployment rates that are twice as high as the national rate. Historically, states have been able to relax some paperwork requirements for SNAP recipients to prove that they are working in areas with high unemployment rates. However, in December 2019, the Trump administration limited states’ ability to account for local availability of jobs by changing the rule governing the long-standing waiver system. It is now more difficult for struggling areas to give residents longer to find a job when jobs are scarce; in the event of a future economic downturn, this rule change will make it harder for everyone to recover.

Policies that require people to prove that they’re working before they can receive benefits rely on debunked stereotypes about fraud and human behavior. Behavioral economic and psychological research has repeatedly shown that scarcity makes it harder for people to plan for anything other than the most immediate emergency. Children who don’t have enough food have worse health and learning outcomes. Adults’ decision-making is influenced by even the perception or fear of scarcity. Moreover, job-seekers are more successful in their searches when they have reliable access to food, shelter, and other basic necessities. Taking SNAP away from families when they lose a job simply punishes those who are already struggling to make ends meet, pushing them deeper into poverty and disrupting their efforts toward financial security.

President Trump’s proposed cuts to SNAP should come as no surprise. His administration has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to restricting families’ access to food. Last year’s budget proposed cuts to SNAP, and the administration spent the next year finding new ways to make those cuts a reality. Each year’s budget under this administration has compounded the cuts of past years, placing the burden on families struggling to make ends meet.

A pair of identical bills in both the Senate and the House of the 2020 Legislature sought to push the seiners at least half a mile off Cat Island, the last remaining island they could still fish.

“If they take Cat Island, all that’s left is one other little inside place where there are so many recreational fishermen and all that it gets run over eight or 10 times a day — there’s nothin’ there. And that’s what they’re wantin’ to leave us with,” said haul seiner Martin Young.

The state’s other four barrier islands have been off-limits to commercial fishermen since the 1990s, when managers of the federal Gulf Islands National Seashore pushed them at least one mile away; Cat Island is shared between federal, state and private owners.

Rep. Timmy Ladner

“The legislation would make it harder for the average Mississippi consumer to obtain fresh, local sustainable seafood,"" said Ryan Bradley, executive director of the Mississippi Commercial Fishermen United. ""It would be a real food security problem for a state that has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire nation.”

The Coastal Conservation Association’s House Bill 561, sponsored by Rep. Timmy Ladner, passed 118-3 on March 11. The sportsmen’s Senate Bill 2720, sponsored by Sens. Mike Thompson, Scott DeLano and Phillip Moran, passed 50-2 on March 10. The bills had moved to the opposite chambers, but the Legislature shut down before they could be voted on.

Sen. Mike Thompson

Mississippi’s Commission on Marine Resources, the specialized panel charged with managing the state’s coastal resources, opposed the bills in an April 7 resolution to the Legislature: “The two legislative bills will unfairly and inequitably restrict the rights and equal access of the commercial fishing industry to the marine resources of the state of Mississippi,” wrote the five-member panel.

The CCA narrowly missed its target in 2018 when the commission was unable to break a tie vote.

“Why have a commission if (the legislators are) gonna overrule what they’re doing?"" asked Young.

Seiners won’t learn whether returning legislators would be sobered by the CMR’s statement — or the recently heightened emphasis on food security — until after the legislature reconvenes on May 7.","And that’s what they’re wantin’ to leave us with,” said haul seiner Martin Young.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is highlighting its partnership with Mississippi State University to develop and enhance animal and veterinary public health, plant and fish health, food safety and nutrition programs.

A new FAO publication titled “Strengthening food security through innovative aquaculture management,” is online at http://www.fao.org/3/ca9300en/CA9300EN.pdf as part of the organization’s academia partnerships webpage.

The FAO brief states, “Joining hands in partnership since 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Mississippi State University (MSU) are collaborating to exchange resources, expertise, experience and knowledge to improve food and nutrition security and alleviate poverty through sustainable aquaculture development efforts.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has led the university for more than a decade, has made food security a central focus of his professional life. Keenum has long advocated the impact major research universities in the United States, particularly land-grant universities like MSU, can have in the global fight against hunger and poverty. Currently, Keenum serves as chairman of both the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the Board of International Food and Agricultural Development.

After establishing its partnership with MSU in 2010, the FAO recognized the university in 2014 as a Center of Knowledge and a member of the Global Aquaculture Advancement Partnership. In 2018, MSU was selected to be a Candidate FAO Reference Center on Aquaculture Biosecurity and Antimicrobial Resistance.

The brief states that key results of the FAO-MSU partnership include combatting aquatic antimicrobial resistance, advancing innovations for food security, improving aquaculture biosecurity, and forming the next generation of food security leaders.

MSU also is home of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and part of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for global populations dependent on aquaculture- and fisheries-led economies. MSU leads the lab through its Global Center for Aquatic Food Security, directed by Mark Lawrence, a professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Lawrence will give a keynote presentation during the FAO’s upcoming webinar in July on innovative biosecurity approaches for a healthier aquaculture industry.

13,"Dec 21, 2020",The Counter,Hunger and food insecurity are not the same. Here’s why that matters—and what they mean.,"For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

But that number actually represented the lowest rates of food insecurity in nearly a decade. The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish at Mississippi State University is awarding $5.7 million in grants to develop innovative approaches for helping solve hunger affecting more than 800 million people worldwide.

As part of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future program and funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Fish Innovation Lab works to reduce poverty and improve nutrition, food security and livelihoods in developing countries by supporting research on sustainable aquaculture and fisheries systems.

“Rich in protein and nutrients, fish are among the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Improving how fish are produced, caught, prepared, distributed and sold can enhance nutrition and livelihoods among small-scale producers and low-income households in many developing countries,” said Mark Lawrence, director of the Fish Innovation Lab and professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

Through the $5.7 million, the Fish Innovation Lab is supporting 12 research-for-development projects focused on aquaculture and fisheries activities along the fish value chain in Bangladesh (3), Cambodia (2), Kenya (1), Nigeria (5) and Zambia (1).

Addressing challenges unique to each location, project teams will be working to increase fish production, mitigate risk of disease and fish loss, and improve human outcomes in targeted regions of the developing countries with high need. All projects also will incorporate the Fish Innovation Lab’s cross-cutting themes—human capacity development, gender equity and youth inclusion, nutrition and resilience. The projects were selected through a competitive process that garnered 247 proposals. Each project is led by a U.S. and a host country principal investigator and supported by a team of researchers at U.S. and host country institutions, fostering shared learning and collaborative strategies throughout the lab.

“The Fish Innovation Lab is a platform for innovation, connecting a consortium of public and private organizations, government agencies, universities and aquaculture associations to address promising advances and emerging challenges in aquaculture and fisheries,” Lawrence said.

Mississippi State is the lead research institution for two of the projects in addition to overseeing and supporting the full research portfolio as the management entity of the Fish Innovation Lab.

Mississippi State is a top-ranking university for agriculture and natural resources research and development, generating more than $100 million in expenditures annually. The university is recognized as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. MSU’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security addresses challenges facing aquaculture and finds solutions to meeting the world’s food security needs while ensuring a safe supply of fish.

WASHINGTON (CN) — Experts called it critical Monday that a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from leaving nearly 700,000 people without food stamps at a time of rising food insecurity with millions of Americans out of work during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ruling against the Department of Agriculture at summary judgment Sunday, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found that the rule it adopted late last year “radically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice” for administering food stamps through SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Howell slammed the agency as “icily silent” on how its proposal would affect more than 1 million people who receive SNAP benefits during a pandemic that so far has killed nearly 220,00 Americans and quadrupled the national unemployment rate.

Food insecurity is on the rise, meanwhile, and still climbing.

“The main frontline of defense that we have is SNAP,” Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center, told Courthouse News on Monday.

After the Great Recession, it took 10 years for the food-insecurity rate to get back to levels seen before the 2008 economic crash, she added.

“We don’t know exactly what this recovery will look like. But we know from prior experience that it takes a long time for people to dig out,” Waxman said.

Julia Henly, who chairs the doctoral program for the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, agreed that SNAP is proven to reduce food insecurity and is a critical economic support to low-income families.

“This is a time to simplify SNAP access, not make the eligibility process more difficult,” Henly said in an email Monday.

States historically have had the power to waive the work mandates that food-stamp beneficiaries face. Without court intervention, the Trump administration would have made such waivers harder to implement. In a thriving economy, noted Henly, such a move makes little sense.

“But it would be especially poor public policy to reinstate work mandates at a time when over 12 million Americans are unemployed and community food banks are stretched to the limit. This is precisely the time when SNAP benefits are most critical, without making their access conditional on work,” she said.

Economist Robert Hartley likewise called the rule a “strange juxtaposition” to the efforts of Congress, which through the CARES Act has suspended time limits on work requirements for so-called “able-bodied adults without dependents” who are eligible for relief under SNAP.

An estimated 700,000 such adults could have found themselves kicked off food stamps this year if the Trump administration’s rule had held up in court.

SNAP is “perhaps the most accessible and successful support” for American families facing economic hardship, a safety net made all the more valuable during the pandemic, Hartley said in an email.

“Restricting access as proposed would offer small savings in relative terms to government spending, but the personal hardship that would result is significant, especially since individuals’ constraints and health challenges may be difficult to observe as we label who is able-bodied,” said Hartley, who is an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University.

Judge Howell, an Obama appointee, had temporarily blocked the rule set to impose new eligibility requirements from taking effect on April 1, calling SNAP essential. In her 67-page ruling Sunday, Howell wrote that USDA had failed to explain how the changes followed the federal rulemaking process or “make sense.”

Just over the last six months, Howell added, “SNAP rosters have grown by over 17 percent with over 6 million new enrollees.”

While the rule change attempted by the Trump administration had targeted adults without dependents, Waxman noted that many food stamp recipients are noncustodial parents. Even if their children live with another parent, such individuals can still bear financial or caretaking responsibilities.

Waxman called SNAP a critical stimulus program that should not be pared back amid a deadly outbreak whose economic toll remains untold, pointing to research that shows every dollar spent in the program returns anywhere from $1.50 to $1.80 back to the recipient’s community.

“This is a program that helps fuel recoveries,” Waxman said. “It’s just a relief that this is one fewer battle that’ll have to be fought right now.”

The lawsuit was brought in January by attorneys general from 19 states as well as the District of Columbia and New York City.

“At a time of national crisis, this decision is a win for common sense and basic human decency,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a press release Monday. “This Trump administration rule was cruel to its core and ran counter to who we are and what we represent as a nation.”

Hartley noted Monday that New York was the first state to pilot a SNAP Online Purchasing program in 2019 that has rapidly expanded to 47 states since May.

Without SNAP, he added, the country would see “large increases in food insecurity, especially unprecedented spikes in child food insecurity, or else extreme lines at food banks or other distribution centers.”

D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine over Twitter Monday called the proposed rule change “heartless and unlawful,” saying it put the lives of the 700,000 Americans who may have lost SNAP benefits at risk.","(AP Photo/Rogelio V.

18,"Oct 11, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,MSU maintains partnership with Nobel Peace Prize winner,"The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

The World Food Program, a United Nations agency, works to provide food for undernourished populations, particularly in countries at war. The MSU Office of Public Affairs issued a congratulatory statement from university president Mark Keenum in a Saturday press release.

“Addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world,” Keenum said. “That is why organizations like the World Food Program are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could bring the number of people facing “acute food insecurity” up to 265 million worldwide, according to an April press release from WFP.

MSU and WFP have worked together since 2010 “on issues related to food safety and nutrition,” MSU Chief Communications Officer Sid Salter said. The two entities signed an agreement in 2014 to focus on “cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development,” according to the press release.

Keenum and two other MSU leaders — Provost David Shaw and Interim Vice President for Research Julie Jordan — with U.N. leaders in Rome in November 2019 to discuss solutions to global food insecurity.

MSU invests $105 million, the eleventh-most nationwide, in agricultural sciences research and development, according to the National Science Foundation.

MSU also is the headquarters and leading institution in the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, an aquaculture research organization funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The lab focuses on building sustainable fish farming systems in countries around the world to alleviate food insecurity.

Keenum is the chairman of both the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. Before becoming MSU’s president in 2009, Keenum was a USDA undersecretary in charge of overseeing international initiatives to combat world hunger.

He wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in January 2016 nominating WFP for that year’s Nobel Peace Prize. In the letter, which Salter provided to The Dispatch, Keenum pointed out WFP’s work to provide “millions of healthy school meals and supplementary nutrition” to children suffering from nutrient deficiencies “in the most destitute parts of the world.”

“All of us, and particularly the developed countries, have a moral obligation to address the persistent human tragedy of hunger and its associated ills,” Keenum wrote. “We must also recognize that lasting peace among and within nations is likely impossible while large populations remain at risk of starvation.”

WFP provided nutritional assistance to nearly 100 million people in 88 countries in 2019, with some of its largest efforts focused on Yemen and South Sudan. Founded in 1961, the organization has helped populations affected by a range of humanitarian crises, including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and wars in the Balkan region of Eastern Europe in the 1990s.","The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

19,"Aug 18, 2020",Business Insider,Mass layoffs and furloughs have led to more Americans unsure about how they will put food on the table,"54 million people in the US will face food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America.

The hardest-hit groups are Black and Latino households, as well as low-income individuals.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Food insecurity is nothing new in the US, but the coronavirus pandemic has exasperated the problem.

Mass layoffs and furloughs have led to more Americans unsure about how they will put food on the table in the coming months.

A pre-pandemic study by the USDA shows ""37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life.""

Based of data from that study, Feeding America estimates the number is "" likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children.""

These disparities are drawn between strong racial and economic divides.

In the US, Latino residents are two times more likely to suffer from food inequality than their white counterparts; Black residents are two-and-a-half times more likely.

This goes hand-in-hand with food deserts, which are more common in areas with a large Latino or Black population.

""It's not new, even though with COVID-19 we've seen an increase in food insecurity overall, and it seems like people of color again are disproportionately impacted,"" Angela Odoms-Young, associate professor in the department of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Bloomberg.

""Eight of the 10 counties with the highest food-insecurity rates are more than 60% Black,"" according to the Feeding America report.

Jefferson County, Mississippi, and Issaquena County, Mississippi will experience the highest rates of food insecurity this year, at 34.2% and 33.9%, respectively. This comes after Issaquena County didn't report a single case of coronavirus until after May 1.

Mississippi also has some of the lowest unemployment benefits in the US, at an average of $213 a week.

There is also no sign of relief coming soon. The federal unemployment benefit of $600 a week lapsed at the end of July, and Congress has not yet signed a deal for a new stimulus package.","54 million people in the US will face food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America.

20,"Mar 12, 2020",Civil Eats,Congress Addresses Food Insecurity in Its Legislative Response to COVID-19,"Editor’s note: This is a developing story; Civil Eats will update as the news evolves.

March 27, 2020 update: The U.S. House of Representative overwhelmingly passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus recovery and stimulus bill today, sending it to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it.

March 26, 2020 update: The Senate’s stimulus bill includes nearly $16 billion for SNAP, but not the additional 15 percent boost that Democrats were seeking. Also included in the bill is a $9.5 billion emergency fund for producers of specialty crops and support for local food systems, including farmers’ markets. In addition, the bill directs $285 million to USDA agencies to support emergency operations during the pandemic.

March 25, 2020 update: The Senate and White House early on Wednesday reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion spending bill aimed at supporting businesses, workers, and individuals during the pandemic. The bill text is not yet public, but once it is made public, the House of Representatives will review and vote on the bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats earlier this week offered their own version of a stimulus / support package.

March 18, 2020 update: The Senate on Wednesday afternoon voted 90-8 to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, aimed at providing some support and benefits to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

March 16, 2020 update: Early on Saturday, March 14, the House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with strong bipartisan support, and with many of the provisions described in the original article below included.

The final text includes language that gives USDA the ability to waive various requirements that are preventing districts from feeding hungry children while schools are shuttered. As of March 15, at least 64,000 schools have closed, affecting more than 32.5 million students.

On SNAP, the final bill prevents eligibility restrictions during a public health emergency and gives states some flexibility to ask for emergency allotments, but does not directly increase benefits. It also provides an additional $500 million in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and an additional $250 million for food programs for low-income seniors, through September 2021.

The Senate is expected to take up the bill today. While some Republicans and President Trump have signaled support, its fate is still uncertain.

March 13, 2020, 3pm ET update:In a press conference at 2:00pm ET, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be “passing a bill” today. “Our bill takes aggressive action to strengthen food security initiatives including student meals as well as SNAP, senior meals, and food banks,” she said. However, Civil Eats has yet to see a final version of the legislative package, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. So it remains unclear which of the provisions on school meals and SNAP benefits (described below, as provisions of separate marker bills) will make it into the final legislation.

March 13, 2020, 11am ET update: As of early Friday, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate the package of legislation; a vote in the House of Representatives is expected today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned for the weekend on Thursday, but canceled the Senate’s scheduled recess next week, so a vote on the legislative package could happen next week if the House passes the bill.

At least 10,600 schools have closed across the U.S., affecting at least 4.9 million students. Five states have closed their schools entirely: Ohio, Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and Washington.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—As aquaculture and fisheries play an increasingly important role in addressing global food security, Mississippi State University is continuing to build its reputation as an international leader in the field.

In addition to leading the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, MSU is playing a key role in developing a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) program to improve aquaculture biosecurity in developing countries. Closer to home, MSU is conducting aquaculture research and extension in support of Mississippi producers. Researchers also are rehabilitating and studying sea turtles and dolphins in the Mississippi Sound to gain insight into the ecosystem’s overall health.

“As the world population continues to grow, aquaculture and fisheries represent an important part of the effort to put food on everybody’s table,” MSU President Mark E. Keenum said. “Like every area of food production, aquaculture has many challenges that producers must navigate, but I am proud of the role MSU is playing at the state, national and international levels to develop solutions that will help achieve global food security.

“Our partnerships with institutions like USAID and FAO are a testament to the outstanding capabilities and leadership of our researchers in this field. I am confident these efforts will generate even more opportunities for MSU to grow its role as a leader in international aquaculture development.”

MSU’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security was founded to leverage the university’s aquatic food security expertise, developed in support of Mississippi aquaculture production, to pursue international development in the area. The center is led by Dr. Mark Lawrence, a professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and director of the Fish Innovation Lab.

Since MSU was selected to lead the Fish Innovation Lab in late 2018, the university has worked with its partners to develop the national and international networks needed to carry out the work, as well as solicit proposals for and fund projects in several developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited international travel, but Lawrence said key partners continue to connect with each other virtually.

MSU has a longstanding relationship with FAO that includes several projects focused on aquaculture health and biosecurity. For the last two years, MSU has been working with FAO to develop a progressive management pathway for aquaculture biosecurity in developing countries. The program creates a four-level development plan for countries to keep their fish supply safe from animal diseases and develop emergency response plans. MSU is recognized as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health by the FAO. The university is in the process of becoming an official FAO Reference Center for Aquaculture Biosecurity, further positioning MSU to assist in global fish health efforts.

Lawrence said fish can play an important role in preventing “hidden hunger” or nutritional stunting, which occurs when people receive sufficient calories, but insufficient nutrients and vitamins because of an imbalanced diet.

“If we can make more fish available in developing countries, it can go a long way in reducing nutritional deficiencies,” Lawrence said. “Reducing childhood nutritional stunting is a major goal of the United Nations and other international agencies, and fish can play a really important role in helping alleviate that problem.”

23,"May 8, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Mississippi identified as most food insecure state in U.S. - The Vicksburg Post,"By Mississippi Today

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.

24,"Jun 3, 2020",PRNewswire,Study Shows State And Local Food Insecurity Reached Lowest Levels Since Its Inception 10 Years Ago,"CHICAGO, June 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- After nearly ten years, food insecurity levels for most communities across the country had reached their lowest levels in 2018, according to a study released by Feeding America. Map the Meal Gap, released today by Feeding America, is the only study that provides local-level estimates of food insecurity across the United States. Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization, has released the report for ten consecutive years to offer insights on how food insecurity and food costs vary at the local level.

In conjunction with the Map the Meal Gap study, which uses the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Census Bureau, Feeding America has released an interactive map based on its recently released study, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, which used the Map the Meal Gap model to predict changes to food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to projected changes to poverty and unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus (COVD-19) pandemic. That analysis shows that progress made to food insecurity in the U.S. this past decade will likely be wiped out and food insecurity rates will climb higher than the peak of the Great Recession of 50 million people, potentially going from more than 37 million people facing hunger in 2018 up to more than 54 million in 2020.

""Map the Meal Gap shows once again that not one single county in this country is free from hunger,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, chief executive officer of Feeding America. ""In the decade before the pandemic, we made progress in finally returning to pre-Great Recession levels of food insecurity, though that number was still regrettably high. That fragile progress has given way under the weight of this crisis. The Feeding America network of food banks knows all too well the precarious nature of household budgets. We also know that the work that we do has great potential to help and we cannot make meaningful progress alone. Our vision is an America where no one is hungry. Join us in making that mission a reality for the tens of millions of people out there who need us now more than ever.""

Per Map the Meal Gap 2020, all 3,142 counties and county equivalents as well as 436 congressional districts in all 50 states are home to people who struggle with hunger. The percentage of the population estimated to be food insecure in 2018 ranges from a low of 3.6% of the population in Burke County, North Dakota up to 30.4% in Jefferson County, Mississippi. Child food insecurity rates range from 2.4% in Falls Church City, Virginia to 43.7% in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana.

According to the COVID-19 impact analysis, the food insecurity rates for all counties across the country will likely see increases. For example, Jefferson County, Mississippi, the county with the highest overall food insecurity rate is projected to increase from 30.4% to 34.2% this year. Burke County, North Dakota, which had the lowest overall food insecurity rate in 2018, is projected to see a food insecurity rate (9.2%) more than 2.5 times its most recent rate (3.6%). In East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, more than half the child population is projected to be food insecure, with the rate going from 43.7% to 52.5% because of the pandemic.

While food insecurity affects every community, people of color and African Americans, in particular, are disproportionately impacted as a result of structural disparities. In 2018, food insecurity among African American households was more than twice that of white, non-Hispanic households according to the USDA. Structural and institutional racism have positioned communities of color as particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout and health consequences of this pandemic. Systemic barriers to jobs less likely to be affected by the pandemic, lower than average wages, and greater employment instability all contribute to African American workers being more at risk of experiencing food insecurity. Both pre-pandemic and in 2020, counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are overrepresented by counties with a majority African American population. For example, in Jefferson County, Mississippi, which has the highest food insecurity rate in 2018 and highest projected rate in 2020, 86% of the population is African American.

These Feeding America studies underscore the extent of need that remains in communities across the United States. Food insecurity is a measure defined by the USDA as lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members.

Other key findings of Map the Meal Gap 2020 include:

One-third of people who are food insecure may not qualify for federal food assistance. Virtually every county (97%) is home to people who are food insecure and likely ineligible for such assistance, and there are 115 counties in which a majority of people estimated to be food insecure is unlikely to qualify.

Counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are disproportionately rural. Rural counties – those outside of major metropolitan areas – make up 63% of all U.S counties, but 87% of counties with food insecurity rates in the top 10%.

An estimated 84% of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity – those that rank in the top 10% of all 3,142 counties – are in the South. Since the South contains 45% of all U.S. counties, this region is home to a disproportionately high number of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity.

""Hunger in America must become unacceptable for all of us,"" Babineaux-Fontenot continued. ""There were 37 million people facing hunger before the pandemic, but most people had no idea. If there is any 'silver lining' to the dark cloud of this pandemic, it is that the American public is far better informed about the food crisis that has accompanied the health one. We know it will take an entire network of support, including food banks, partner agencies like food pantries, federal nutrition programs, the food industry, and the public to make the progress that is so desperately needed.""

Map the Meal Gap 2020 uses data from USDA, the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and food price data and analysis provided by Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company. The study is supported by Conagra Brands Foundation and Nielsen.

""Conagra Brands Foundation is proud to partner with Feeding America and food banks across the country to help provide food to children, teenagers, adults and senior citizens. Helping to increase awareness of this critical issue, which affects every community in America, has never been more important,"" said Robert J. Rizzo, Senior Director, Community Investment, Conagra Brands and Conagra Brands Foundation.

In addition to food-insecurity estimates, Map the Meal Gap reports on food price variation across counties. Using data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS), the study finds that, on average, food-secure individuals report spending $3.09 per person, per meal as of 2018. This is essentially the same as the national average of $3.02 ($3.09 in 2018 dollars) as reported in Map the Meal Gap last year.

After adjusting the national average meal cost of $3.09 based on local sales taxes and Nielsen data on relative food prices, Map the Meal Gap 2020 finds that county meal costs range from 69% of the national average in places like Llano County, Texas ($2.14) to more than double the average cost in places like New York County, New York ($6.19).

""Nielsen is proud to continue our decade long data and analytics partnership to Map the Meal Gap. Eliminating hunger is especially urgent with so many vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said David Rawlinson, CEO, Nielsen Global Connect.

Dr. Craig Gundersen, Professor of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois, Executive Director of the National Soybean Research Laboratory and a member of Feeding America's Technical Advisory Group is the lead researcher of Map the Meal Gap 2020 and the food insecurity projection analysis.

Map the Meal Gap 2020 provides the following data online through an interactive map:

The estimated percentage of the population and number of individuals who are food insecure in every U.S. state, county and congressional district, as well as the service area of each Feeding America food bank.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely qualifies for SNAP and other federal nutrition programs.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely does not qualify for federal nutrition programs and thus must rely even more on charitable food assistance. These percentages reflect individuals in households with earnings that are higher than the state gross income limits for federal nutrition programs.

The average meal cost in every state and county.

The food budget shortfall in every state and county.

The Map the Meal Gap 2020 map allows policymakers, state agencies, corporate partners, food banks and advocates to develop integrated strategies to fight hunger on a community level.

Separately, a new interactive map shows the 2020 food insecurity projections compared to the most recent Map the Meal Gap data. To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national annual unemployment projection due to COVID-19 using projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation from Goldman Sachs Investment Research and actual percentages of workers by industry from the American Community Survey.

Along with the interactive map and visualizations, Feeding America has also published a series of report briefs, including a summary of key findings as well as analyses on child food insecurity, food price variation and health, disability and food insecurity.

Federal nutrition assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), serve as the first line of defense against hunger. However, not everyone who is food insecure qualifies for these federal programs. As of 2018, one in three (32%) food-insecure individuals who reported income lived in households unlikely to qualify for most federal food assistance. These findings underscore the importance of protecting and strengthening the existing safety net of public food assistance while also investing in the charitable programs that help to fill the gap for people who are not eligible.

","""In the decade before the pandemic, we made progress in finally returning to pre-Great Recession levels of food insecurity, though that number was still regrettably high.
Child food insecurity rates range from 2.4% in Falls Church City, Virginia to 43.7% in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana.
Burke County, North Dakota, which had the lowest overall food insecurity rate in 2018, is projected to see a food insecurity rate (9.2%) more than 2.5 times its most recent rate (3.6%).

Keenum sign memorandums of understanding to create three new programs with FAO offering international internship, fellowship and volunteer opportunities for MSU students, recent graduates and faculty. Keenum and other senior MSU administrators attended meetings at the FAO headquarters in Rome on Wednesday [Nov. 6], and Keenum delivered a speech about the university’s work to address key challenges of the 21st century.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State University’s work to address key challenges of the 21st century was the focus of a speech delivered by MSU President Mark E. Keenum in Italy today [Nov. 6].

At the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome, Keenum addressed an audience of FAO officials and staff, as well as ambassadors to the UN’s mission in the historic capital city.

“We know that agriculture is a key to transforming developing nations and reducing poverty,” he said. “We also know that for the United States, investing in international agriculture aid pays dividends domestically.”

According to the FAO, more than 820 million people suffer from chronic hunger and about 736 million people live in extreme poverty. The agency is working with its partners to “achieve a world without hunger, malnutrition and poverty and do so in a sustainable manner.”

Keenum described the impact major research universities in the United States, like MSU, can have in the global fight against hunger and poverty.

“American universities, and particularly land-grant institutions such as Mississippi State University, are well equipped to help governments, international organizations like FAO, the private business sector, and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in addressing these pervasive problems,” he said. “Land-grant universities have knowledge, infrastructure and experience pertinent to every aspect of the food chain, from the laboratory to the farm to the market to the table. Our challenge is to bring our resources to bear on critical global issues.”

A former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Keenum has made food security a central focus of his professional life. Currently, he serves as chairman of both the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the Board of International Food and Agricultural Development.

Mississippi State is ranked in the top 10 nationally for agriculture and natural resources research and development, generating more than $100 million in expenditures annually. The university is actively engaged in support of Mississippi agriculture, which has a nearly $8 billion annual farm-gate value and employs more than a quarter of the workforce in the state.

In addition to the speech, Keenum signed agreements to expand Mississippi State’s partnership with the FAO. The memorandums of understanding will create three new programs offering international internship, fellowship and volunteer opportunities for MSU students, recent graduates and faculty.

“Rome continues to be a priority for us as our global engagement efforts grow in depth and scope academically and in research,” said MSU Provost and Executive Vice President David Shaw. “These new agreements will benefit our students and faculty, and also contribute to FAO’s overall mission.”

Shaw and Interim Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan joined Keenum for meetings in Rome with the FAO and several additional MSU partners in the city, including the University of Rome Tor Vergata and the University of Arkansas Rome Center.

Jordan also continues to serve as associate vice president for international programs and director of the MSU International Institute.

“The study abroad opportunities for our students and faculty exchanges we have in place in Rome will benefit from the additional agreements with the FAO,” Jordan said. “International engagement is based on having successful partnerships, and we are fortunate to have great partners in Rome and a thriving collaborative culture at MSU.”

MSU has a long-standing relationship with the FAO, with research partnerships focused on food safety, nutrition, aquatic animal health and agriculture, among other areas. The FAO and the World Food Programme have recognized MSU as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health.

Mississippi State offers a study abroad program for students at Arkansas’ Rome Center. Housed in a 500-year-old building in the ancient yet modern city, the program offers courses in architecture, art, interior design, humanities, fashion design, historic preservation and business.

MSU has hosted more than a dozen students from Tor Vergata over the past few years. In the summer of 2020, students and faculty from MSU’s Bagley College of Engineering will be visiting the public research university.

In the wake of immigration raids that resulted in nearly 700 people being arrested, Mississippi held a job fair to hire more workers for food processors on Monday.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

In Mississippi, one of the food processing companies that was raided last week by immigration officials is now looking for workers. Nearly 700 people were arrested in those raids. Some of them worked at plants operated by Koch Foods. Today, Koch held a job fair in the town of Forest, Miss. NPR's Debbie Elliott was there and sends this report.

DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Early morning, it seemed as if members of the media outnumbered job applicants at the WIN Job Center.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, no media.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: No media.

ELLIOTT: No media.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah.

ELLIOTT: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: What is that?

ELLIOTT: A security guard turned reporters away as a steady stream of people went inside to put in an application. Amanda Steele of Morton got here early before the doors opened.

AMANDA STEELE: Well, I'm, you know, finding a job, and I heard they might be doing some hiring. And me and my daughter come here Friday, and we did an application. And we seen the sign that said they were going to have the job fair. And then we come on out this morning. We got up at 6 o'clock this morning ready to go. Hopefully, we walk out of here with some good news, with a job.

ELLIOTT: Steele and other applicants say they had to provide two forms of identification, including a Social Security card. She has mixed feelings about the ICE raids that separated some families.

STEELE: Yeah, you know, I feel bad for the little kids, too. You know, their mom and dad's out of a job, you know, but I've been out of a job too, you know?

ELLIOTT: A little over a hundred people had put in applications by mid-morning according to Mississippi Department of Employment Security spokeswoman Dianne Bell.

DIANNE BELL: This is actually business as usual for us. We do not have a multitude of people coming in.

ELLIOTT: The WIN Job Center is a centralized job search location, and Bell says it's typical for the agency to host job fairs and collect applications for companies. Bell says Koch Foods asked for this job fair last Wednesday, the day of the raids. She does not know how many workers Koch needs, and no one from the company was at the job fair site.

Koch's chicken processing plant in Morton, Miss., employs more than a thousand people at peak production. In a statement, Koch said it does not yet know how many workers were arrested and said the raid resulted in a significant disruption of work. Morton Mayor Gerald Keeton hopes Koch can find the workers it needs to stay in business.

GERALD KEETON: Koch Food is the largest employer in our city, and they're attributed to approximately 45% of our total revenue in our city. So, you know, that's - if they are not here, we're in trouble.

ELLIOTT: Twenty-two-year-old Kamerio Whitley came from Lake, Miss., to apply. He says he used to work at the plant.

KAMERIO WHITLEY: I want to do my old job - hanging birds, rehanging cold birds.

ELLIOTT: Whitley says there's a misconception that only people here illegally want the poultry jobs.

WHITLEY: They won't complain about the job as much as everybody else, but I believe that all of the jobs in these chicken plants are fairly easy.

ELLIOTT: He sees the ICE raids as an opportunity. So does Rodney Reid of Forest.

RODNEY REID: Well, I'm currently employed right now at a lumber mill, but it just don't cut it. It just don't pay, and these chicken plants pay twice what I'm getting paid now, so I'm trying to shoot for better.

ELLIOTT: Workers there can make upwards of $10 an hour.

REID: A lot of these people right from right here need these jobs, you know? If they were over here illegally - I mean, it's rough out here. They come over here and tell me, it's hard to beat them out. They're going to work cheaper, you know what I'm saying? It used to be you come down here and put these applications in, you was wasting your time.

ELLIOTT: Reid says he actually feels confident about getting a job this time.

OXFORD, Miss. – Attending an international summit on world food security proved an unforgettable experience for a University of Mississippi junior who was among an elite group selected to attend the event.

“As I stepped foot in the plenary hall on the first day of the conference, I felt myself being surrounded by the world,” said Rohan Agrawal, a Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College student who attended the Committee on World Food Security at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations headquarters in Rome.

Agrawal was one of only four U.S. college students awarded a Planet Forward scholarship to the meeting, where he met with foreign diplomats, including the leader of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s agricultural development team.

“The opportunity to meet with so many global leaders and discuss the role of technology in important issues like poverty, hunger, education and climate change is something I will always treasure,” he said.

Agrawal became interested in using technology to revolutionize agriculture, conserve resources and increase yields before leaving his home in Central India to attend Ole Miss. The computer science major, who is pursuing minors in international relations and mathematics, spoke before the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year as part of an Honors College-sponsored trip to New York.

During the meeting, Agrawal had an opportunity to interact with keynote speaker María Juliana Ruiz Sandoval, the first lady of Colombia, and interview her about Colombia’s plans for enhancing its technical resiliency to engage more youth.

Experiencing food supply shortages while growing up, Agrawal has written and published his observations about poverty, hunger and climate change in several compelling essays.

“One of the most startling things I’ve noticed is how wasteful the United States is when it comes to food,” Agrawal said. “In India, healthy food is scarce, but in the U.S. there’s plenty of food being grown. Still, it isn’t being properly managed and used by the masses.

“Globally, 40 percent of the world’s food supply is wasted. That amounts to $1 trillion annually.”

Agrawal wrote in his competition essay: “The Mississippi Delta holds some of the most fertile lands in the country for agriculture due to the presence of the Mississippi River. It is best suited for crops like beans, whole grains and the like, that are not only healthy but also sustainable for the environment.

“Instead, the state abundantly cultivates corn and soybeans, crops that wreak havoc on the environment. Farmers only want to grow certain crops that are subsidized by the government under the Farm Bill – corn and soybeans being the two major subsidized crops.”

During the conference in Rome, Agrawal also learned that only 15 people on the earth control $1 trillion of the global economy.

“If just those 15 people were to create an endowment, the interest from it would yield $50 billion, which is enough to get every child on this planet through higher upper secondary education,” he said.

Agrawal’s passion about climate change, agriculture and technology led him to create his own applied research. He is working to create an energy “dashboard” that will measure energy use at Ole Miss.

“I’m seeking to track water and energy utilization in every building across our campus, place the data into a virtual reality software that would allow anyone to monitor all these uses in real time,” Agrawal said. “Several other universities our size already have such capabilities and are using them to optimize energy consumption.

“I’m trying to see that the University of Mississippi keeps up with the issues that affect us all.”

Following the meeting, Agrawal will write another paper about his experiences and submit it to Planet Forward for publication. Ultimately, he hopes to raise awareness and promote activism around climate change.

“Rohan’s extraordinary commitment as citizen and scholar sets him apart not just as a leader in our academic community, but as a distinctive voice within the communities of nations,” said Douglass Sullivan-Gonzalez, Honors College dean. “We are very proud that he represents the SMBHC and our University of Mississippi among national leaders pushing for sustainable development for all peoples.”

At the conference, students participated in extracurricular events, met with experts and shared updates about their experience and takeaways through videos and a blog series.

Engaging college students from across the country, Planet Forward is an initiative of the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs that uses storytelling, media and educational events to tell the stories of invention and innovation.","– Attending an international summit on world food security proved an unforgettable experience for a University of Mississippi junior who was among an elite group selected to attend the event.

30,"Dec 7, 2020",Associated Press,Millions of hungry Americans turn to food banks for 1st time,"Millions of hungry Americans turn to food banks for 1st time

The deadly pandemic that tore through the nation’s heartland struck just as Aaron Crawford was in a moment of crisis. He was looking for work, his wife needed surgery, then the virus began eating away at her work hours and her paycheck.

The Crawfords had no savings, mounting bills and a growing dread: What if they ran out of food? The couple had two boys, 5 and 10, and boxes of macaroni and cheese from the dollar store could go only so far.

A 37-year-old Navy vet, Crawford saw himself as self-reliant. Asking for food made him uncomfortable. “I felt like I was a failure,” he says. “It’s this whole stigma ... this mindset that you’re this guy who can’t provide for his family, that you’re a deadbeat.”

Hunger is a harsh reality in the richest country in the world. Even during times of prosperity, schools hand out millions of hot meals a day to children, and desperate elderly Americans are sometimes forced to choose between medicine and food.

Now, in the pandemic of 2020, with illness, job loss and business closures, millions more Americans are worried about empty refrigerators and barren cupboards. Food banks are doling out meals at a rapid pace and an Associated Press data analysis found a sharp rise in the amount of food distributed compared with last year. Meanwhile, some folks are skipping meals so their children can eat and others are depending on cheap food that lacks nutrition.

Those fighting hunger say they’ve never seen anything like this in America, even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The first place many Americans are finding relief is a neighborhood food pantry, most connected to vast networks of nonprofits. Tons of food move each day from grocery store discards and government handouts to warehouse distribution centers, and then to the neighborhood charity.

(AP Video/Martha Irvine and Gerald Herbert)

The Crawfords turned to the Family Resource Centers and Food Shelf, part of 360 Communities, a nonprofit 15 minutes from their apartment in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When needed, they receive monthly boxes of fresh produce, dairy, deli, meat and other basics — enough food to fill two grocery carts. If that runs out, they can get an emergency package to tide them over for the rest of the month.

Crawford’s wife, Sheyla, had insisted they seek help; her hours had been cut at the day care center where she worked. At first, Crawford was embarrassed to go the food shelf; he worried he’d bump into someone he knew. He now sees it differently.

“It didn’t make me a bad man or a terrible husband or father,” he says. “On the contrary, I was actually doing something to make sure that my wife and kids had something thing to eat.”

The history books are filled with iconic images of America’s struggles against hunger. Among the most memorable are the Depression-era photos of men standing in breadlines, huddled in long coats and fedoras, their eyes large with fear. An overhead sign reads: “Free Soup. Coffee and a Doughnut for the Unemployed.”

This year’s portrait of hunger has a distinctively bird’s eye view: Enormous traffic jams captured from drone-carrying cameras. Cars inching along, each driver waiting hours for a box or bag of food. From Anaheim, California to San Antonio, Texas to Toledo, Ohio and Orlando, Florida and points in-between, thousands of vehicles carrying hungry people queued up for miles across the horizon. In New York, and other large cities, people stand, waiting for blocks on end.

The newly hungry have similar stories: Their industry collapsed, they lost a job, their hours were cut, an opportunity fell through because of illness.

Handwritten “closed” signs appeared on the windows of stores and restaurants soon after the pandemic arrived. Paychecks shrank or disappeared altogether as unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7 percent, a rate not seen in almost a century.

Food banks felt the pressure almost immediately.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, scrambled to keep up as states locked down and schools — many providing free breakfasts and lunches — closed. In late March, 20 percent of the organization’s 200 food banks were in danger of running out of food.

The problem with supply subsided, but demand has not. Feeding America has never handed out so much food so fast — 4.2 billion meals from March through October. The organization has seen a 60 percent average increase in food bank users during the pandemic: about 4 in 10 are first-timers.

An AP analysis of Feeding America data from 181 food banks in its network found the organization has distributed nearly 57 percent more food in the third quarter of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

There will be no quick decline as the pandemic rages on, having already claimed more than 280,000 lives and infecting 14.7 million people across the nation.

Feeding America estimates those facing hunger will swell to 1 in 6 people, from 35 million in 2019 to more than 50 million by this year’s end. The consequences are even more dire for children — 1 in 4, according to the group.

Some states have been hit especially hard: Nevada, a tourist mecca whose hotel, casino and restaurant industries were battered by the pandemic, is projected to vault from 20th place in 2018 to 5th place this year in food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America.

In four states — Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana — more than 1 in 5 residents are expected to be food insecure by year’s end, meaning they won’t have money or resources to put food on the table, the report said.

In New Orleans one recent Saturday morning, Donna Duerr was waiting to pick up food in a drive-through donation — something that has become part of her routine since COVID-19 swept in last spring.

Her husband was laid off from his job as a pipefitter and she’s unable to work, having undergone two surgeries — one on her spine, the other on her arm — in the last two months. She also has two grown children who’ve moved home since the pandemic began.

“This is a hard thing to accept that you have to do this,” says a weary-sounding Duerr, her throat covered with bandages as the result of a recent operation. Every morning she monitors the local news for announcements of the next food donation; she tries to attend as many as she can, sometimes sharing the food with less-mobile neighbors.

Duerr, 56, faces painful choices. “I either pay bills or get food,” she says, though these donations have brought some relief.

Norman Butler is another first-timer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he and his girlfriend, Cheryl, arrived at 3 a.m. at a drive-through food bank in a suburban New Orleans sports stadium. They joined a pre-dawn procession of mothers with their kids, the elderly and folks like him — unemployed workers.

“You can see the look of uncertainty on their faces,” he says. “Everybody’s just worried about their next meal.”

Before the pandemic, Butler, 53, flourished in the tourism-dominated city, working as an airport shuttle and limousine driver, a valet and hotel doorman. Since March, when the bustling streets turned silent, jobs in the city have been scarce.

“A lot of people are in limbo,” he says. “The main thing we need is to get back to work.”

Low-wage employees, many in the service industry, have borne the brunt of economic hardship. But the misery has reached deeper into the workforce.

A September report commissioned by the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, found 1 in 4 of those reporting they didn’t have enough to eat typically had incomes above $50,000 a year before the outbreak.

In Anchorage, Alaska, Brian and Airis Messick were coasting along in full-time jobs for companies that support the state’s oil industry. They were moving toward buying a house.

When March arrived, everything unraveled.

Brian, 28, the newest hire at an electrical wiring company, was laid off. Within a week, Airis, an office worker at an oil well testing firm, lost her job, too.

Then it became a monthly game of deciding who gets paid first with their unemployment checks — the landlord or one of the many bills. They kept their car filled with gas in case they had to move.

The Messicks and their 9-year-old son, Jayden, tried to survive on $50 to $75 a week because, she says, “that’s all we could squeeze.” They turned to a food bank for only the second time — they’d sought help after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.

After that devastation, the Messicks, who’d met in Florida, decided to get a fresh start and move to Alaska, where Airis had grown up.

Airis, who just turned 30, found work in August, ironically, at the state unemployment office. “I hear people’s stories all day,” she says. “I listen to moms cry about not having money to take care of their kids. My heart aches for the people who get denied.”

Brian stays home with Jayden, who is autistic, helping him with school and driving him to appointments. Also part of the family are Cleo, a pit bull-lab mix, and Daisy, a bearded dragon.

Airis earns too much for the family to receive state financial aid. Anchorage’s high cost-of-living, partly fueled by the expense of shipping goods to the nation’s most northern state, makes it harder to economize even with coupons and careful shopping.

She says the family will continue to go to the food bank until the economy improves, which she expects won’t be soon.

There should be better systems in place, she says, to help families.

“I feel great knowing that we’re not alone, that we’re, you know, not out here being the only one suffering but,” she says, “it makes me mad to know my government failed us.”

For communities of color, the pandemic has been a compound disaster with Blacks and Latinos reeling from disproportionately high rates of deaths, infections — and joblessness.

Unemployment surged among Latinos to 18.9 percent this spring, higher than any other racial and ethnic group, according to federal statistics. Though it has since fallen, many are still struggling.

More than 1 in 5 Black and Latino adults with children said as of July 2020 they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat, according to the commissioned report. That was double the rate of white and Asian households. It also found that women, households with children and people of color are at greatest risk of hunger.

Abigail Leocadio, 34, first approached the nonprofit Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, Arizona, during hard times about a decade ago. Her family rebounded and she completed training to become a phlebotomist, landing a job drawing blood specimens for a local lab.

Leocadio was just 7 when her family brought her to the U.S. from their native Cuernavaca, Mexico. She currently is protected from deportation and has a work permit through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

When her husband, a restaurant cook, was laid off earlier in the pandemic, her income — barely more than the $11 state minimum wage — wasn’t enough to cover their expenses.

Though they own a two-bedroom trailer, they pay $500 a month to rent the lot. Add to that as much as $450 in monthly electric bills and internet service so their four kids, 9 to 15, can attend class remotely. Before schools closed, the kids received free breakfasts and lunches on campus.

“It has been hard feeding all the kiddos daily,” Leocadio said outside the trailer after a recent delivery from the charity of two boxes including canned tomatoes, dried beans, rice, breakfast cereal and the kids’ undisputed favorite: specialty Oreo cookies.

The food, she says, provides less than half of what her family eats in four weeks, but significantly reduces their monthly bill to about $250. Before the pandemic, the family was saving to buy a house, but that money has been wiped out. Her husband, though, is back at work.

“We always figure out things one way or another,” Leocadio says, though she’s worried about the surge in coronavirus cases and what lies ahead. “We really don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Briana Dominguez had been depending on food pantries in the Chicago area since last fall to supplement her groceries. With two sons, ages 3 and 14, it was hard to keep up, even though she and her boyfriend both worked full-time.

“I never thought it would be me,” she says of her visits to the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois. “But you do what you gotta do to survive.”

A series of misfortunes brought them to a turning point.

Dominguez had a miscarriage, and her father lost his job, due to the pandemic. So did her boyfriend, a trucker. In November her company, which sells ceiling tiles for hospitals and other business, eliminated her job with little notice.

Dominguez, 34, who has a small severance, has decided to move to Georgia, where she has family and living costs are lower. Her boyfriend has found work as a customer service representative that he can do from anywhere, though it’s only $13 an hour. She traveled there in early December to scout job possibilities.

“If I don’t do it now,” she says, “I’ll never do it.”

While food banks have become critical during the pandemic, they’re just one path for combating hunger. For every meal from a food bank, a federal program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, provides nine.

Anti-hunger groups have lobbied Congress for a 15 percent increase in maximum food stamp benefits, A similar measure went a long way in digging the nation out of the Great Recession. A stimulus bill passed by the House this spring includes such a provision, but it has been bogged down in partisan squabbling.

“Food banks and food pantries are doing great work,” says Luis Guardia, president of thee Food Research & Action Center. “But they simply cannot do enough to be something of the order of magnitude that we’re seeing right now. ”

Many going to food pantries also are receiving food stamps, though eligibility varies among states.

Aaron Crawford says the addition of $550 in food stamps the family started receiving last summer has made a significant difference in their lives.

Others have discovered they couldn’t make it without food help, even with Social Security or other benefits.

Phyllis Marder, 66, had both Social Security and unemployment when she arrived at the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois, where she’s lived in the same bungalow for 20 years.

She’d been supplementing her benefits as an Uber drive, and when the pandemic hit, she helped workers bring home their computers and office gear. After that, she ferried medical and other front-line workers, but that came to an abrupt end with a COVID-19 scare.

At first, Marder, didn’t tell anyone about visiting food pantries. Then she had a change of heart. “Keeping a secret makes things get worse,” she says, “… and makes me feel worse about myself, and so I decided that it was more important to talk about it.”

Marder sometimes shared her food with neighbors and a panhandler on a freeway ramp. But she expects her food bank visits will end soon.

In a few days, she starts a job — courtesy of the pandemic.

She’ll be a coronavirus contract tracer, working remotely for a nearby county.

As the year nears its end, Crawford is more confident.

The months have been filled with setbacks and successes. Both Crawfords developed mild cases of COVID-19. Sheyla had hysterectomy surgery and was out work without pay for six weeks.

But they’ve rebounded, too.

Crawford has two part-time jobs, one at United Parcel Service, the second as a maintenance worker at a home for the elderly. His wife is back at work at the day care center. And their boys are receiving breakfast and lunch at their school that provides day care.

The financial troubles that brought them to the food bank haven’t disappeared. They still have overdue bills and a car that needs repairs.

But after many dark months, there have been moments of relief. This fall when the couple contracted COVID-19, their sons’ school sent meals and milk to help,

And a friend had an 18-pound turkey delivered for a Thanksgiving feast. It was so big the Crawfords had to figure out how to find room for the leftovers in the refrigerator now stocked with food.

A full fridge, Crawford says, is a welcome sight.

“It just kind of puts you at ease,” he says. “There’s a sense of peace.”

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A new grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service will facilitate scientific exchanges between Mississippi State University and key partners in Africa to support food, plant and animal safety programs.

The $974,000 grant focuses on establishing and harmonizing regulations put forth by the African Union’s Continental Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee by developing knowledge, support and leadership in stakeholders. As part of the grant, MSU will work with African Union administrators, technical experts, as well as representatives from each of Africa’s eight Regional Economic Communities. A team from MSU made a presentation to the African Union committee during a virtual meeting in October.

The goal of the collaboration is to create and implement new standards for the safe trade of agricultural products across the eight Regional Economic Communities of the African Union.

“This project is a great example of the role MSU plays in working to ensure a safe and abundant global food supply,” said MSU Interim Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan. “Together, we will work with the USDA-FAS and strategic partners in Africa to enhance knowledge of food, animal and plant safety, as well as promote food security and economic opportunity across the continent. We look forward to getting this exciting work underway.”

Dr. Margaret Khaitsa, a professor of epidemiology in the university’s College of Veterinary Medicine, will serve as MSU’s lead on the project. A native of Uganda, Khaitsa specializes in large animal herd health and has led multiple initiatives in Africa to support women’s leadership in agriculture. Bryan Farrell, project manager at MSU’s International Institute, also will help manage the project.

“Food borne illness and death is a major concern across Africa,” Khaitsa said. “The MSU team is very honored to be aiding in the human capital development of individuals to address the complex issue of increasing food safety.”

MSU will recruit and identify 24 people to become fellows of a new scientific exchange program, with representation from each Regional Economic Community. The university and USDA-FAS will work together to initiate meetings with leaders in Washington, D.C. Additionally, MSU will host science and technical experts from the group on campus to share expertise and best practices in specific areas. Each expert will be assigned a faculty mentor while on campus.

33,"Nov 30, 2018",Ole Miss News,Office of Food and Nutrition Security Opens at South Oxford Center,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The School of Applied Sciences at the University of Mississippi has opened a new Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the South Oxford Center.

Although David H. Holben, professor of nutrition and hospitality management, has been producing food security research at UM since he arrived in 2015, he and his students finally have devoted space to analyze data, conduct focus groups and interviews, and engage with community members.

“My vision for the Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the University of Mississippi is to be the recognized leader in providing innovative solutions for food insecurity in Mississippi, the United States and the world,” said Holben, who has been studying the problem since 1997.

“I’m hoping that we can have a global impact. I think (establishing a formal office) just reinforces the support that the university and the school have for this issue of food insecurity.”

Food insecurity is a lack of regular access to enough food to maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. According to the USDA’s 2017 estimates, some 15 million American households were food insecure.

More than 13 percent of rural households reported food insecurity, much higher than those in metropolitan areas. Between 2015 and 2017, food insecurity in Mississippi was among the highest in the nation, at 17.2 percent.

The university community is committed to helping solve this problem through its Flagship Constellations initiative, which seeks to find meaningful solutions through multidisciplinary response to health and social issues affecting Mississippi communities, the nation and the world. One of those constellations is Community Wellbeing, which works to find solutions to the challenges affecting rural communities to build stronger and more vibrant communities.

Holben brings food security expertise and research from the Office of Food and Nutrition Security to this collaboration.

Students and staff conducting research through the Office of Food and Nutrition Security have presented their findings at international conferences, including discussions of seven studies at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ annual conference in October.

Doctoral student Prabhdeep Sandha, of Jalandhar City, India, earned the Mead Johnson Nutrition/Research Dietetic Practice Group Student Research Award at the conference for her study, “Impact of a Produce Intervention on Parental Produce Intake and Behaviors,” co-authored by fellow graduate student Michelle Weber, of Cincinnati.

“Our (office) is continuously working to make a difference in Mississippi through fresh produce and healthy food interventions, community engagement and community education,” Sandha said. “With our previous projects, we were able to see some great results, which I hope will be evident in our future projects.”

Undergraduate students also are gaining research skills through the new office. Katelyn Tarr, a junior dietetics and nutrition major from Pawnee, Illinois, presented a study on “Food insecurity and type 2 diabetes risk of adults with school children” at the conference, with funding from the first Undergraduate Travel Grant awarded by the UM Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.

“Dr. Holben brought me in to learn how to write an abstract and make a poster for a conference, which is something that graduate students would normally do,” Tarr said. “It really helped me prepare for my post-graduate career.

“I was excited to work on nutrition research, but it turns out this really hits close to home for me. I’m from an area that has high food insecurity, so it was awesome to be a part of that.”

Five of the abstracts presented at conference stem from the Farm-to-YOUth! Project that Holben and his students have been working on since 2016, studying varying nutritional and educational interventions and their impact on food security in a rural Mississippi county.

From produce tastings and take-home produce for elementary school children to summer nutrition education and feeding programs at the public library, the faculty-student team has examined different ways to improve food security for people living in rural areas.

This fall, the office rolled out a new study in Calhoun County to examine food education interventions for high school athletes.

Holben, along with an external consultant, develops the twice-weekly programming that includes a lesson, snack and educational handouts. Graduate students Marta Dees, of Oxford, and Rebecca Henry, of The Plains, Virginia, teach the lessons and give each football player a take-home bag of fuel for the week, including peanut butter, yogurt, fresh fruit and granola bars, to implement the practices at home.

“We’re primarily hoping to change the food environment at home,” Holben said. “They’re learning eight to 10 basic principles about food and nutrition that we’re helping them to implement through take-home food packages.

“I think we can play a really key role in teaching basic sport nutrition principles to high schoolers, while keeping performance nutrition at the forefront of the coach’s mind. The hope is we can fill in the gap if they do have food insecurity in the home to help them to implement some performance nutrition principles since they’re athletes.”

Holben, lead author of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ most recent position paper on food insecurity in the United States, is elated with the opportunities that come with having an official office at the South Oxford Center. He looks forward to playing a significant role in fulfilling the university’s commitment to creating healthier, more vibrant communities.

34,"Dec 26, 2018",Mississippi Today,Gloster’s first grocery store in decades highlights statewide food insecurity,"GLOSTER — For residents here, food excursions would range from the 30 minute round-trip to Centreville, to the 2-hour round-trip to Baton Rouge, La. The nearest Walmart and Kroger, over in McComb, are roughly an hour’s drive each way.

A small rural town in Amite County, Gloster is just south of the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi; it’s less than two square miles in size and home to around a thousand residents, according to the 2016 American Community Survey.

Companies are scared, despite minimal competition, that they won’t make enough of a profit to survive in towns with a small consumer base — towns like Gloster. In a sparsely populated state like Mississippi, this is a common dilemma, especially when it comes to access to food.

But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving. The town’s first grocery store in decades.

“We needed this,” said Felecia Nayland, 56, who’s lived in Gloster all her life. I just hope and pray that they continue to do good business here so they’ll stay here.”

Nayland said previously, access to fruits and vegetables in town was “pretty much non-existent.”

Limited access to grocery stores in rural areas is one reason Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Over half a million Mississippians did not know where their next meal would come from between 2015 and 2017, according to the latest report from Hunger Free America, “The Red, White, and Blue Hunger Wave: A 2018 United States Hunger Atlas.”

Many here see the public-private partnership that brought the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Gloster as part of the solution to an all-too-common problem in rural towns around the state — availability of affordable, fresh food.

Lavonne Sanders, 50, has also lived in Gloster her whole life, and said the last time the town had a store like this was when she was a little girl, about 30-40 years ago. That too was a Piggly Wiggly.

“I love this store, it’s made a big change,” Sanders said. “We don’t have to go Centreville anymore. You don’t have to spend that gas money now.”

While the store licenses the Piggly Wiggly brand, the shop itself is independently owned and operated by Jason Cook. Cook, from Hattiesburg, learned about Gloster a few years ago while at a previous job. The company was considering expansion into the small town, but in the end opted against it. Since then, Cook opened a Piggly Wiggly in Angie, La. — but he didn’t forget about Gloster.

“I came back here when I was financially able to,” Cook said, “just because after having talks with the community I knew how bad it was here. So the Lord led us back here.

“Most companies will turn their nose up at a store doing under $100,000 a week in sales. My approach is a little different; I do it to operate a business, but I also do it out of just having humanity and compassion. The way I do things aren’t necessarily the way anyone else does them.”

The city approved a tax incentive for the store, which will reimburse Cook for exterior improvements like the parking lot and sidewalk repair. Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened. The store created 22 jobs.

“If you can get into a town where the government will help you get established there to lower your overhead (cost), then you can make it,” Cook said. “You don’t get greedy, and you don’t take advantage of people, you just operate. I live within my means. I’ve got to make a profit in order to pay the bills, but I’m not trying to become a millionaire off of it.”

After years of driving out of town, often out of county, to find fresh produce and essentials, residents were prepared to fill Piggly Wiggly; by 3 p.m. on a Monday, the grocery store was the busiest place in Gloster.

“It’s brought some life back to the town,” said Rachel Stevens, 54, who works at a business on Main St. around the corner from the new store.

Stevens and other residents discussed having to cram all their grocery shopping into a couple trips a month.

“We’d have to stock up. It’s really inconvenient when you run out of stuff. We had no choice, no options,” she added.

More than just the convenience, residents think the Piggly Wiggly will lift spirits and create momentum for the town.

“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago. “I knew it was hyped up when people, even in the other counties, would say, ‘Did you hear about the Piggly Wiggly?’ It’s the biggest thing in a long time in this area.”

“It’s gonna be some more changes coming,” Sanders said. “I believe.”

“To hear over the course of several years how badly a grocery store was needed and wanted in the town, and now that the town finally has it, it really is a feeling of bliss and happiness,” said Rep. Angela Cockerham, D-Magnolia, who represents Amite County.

Cockerham, an attorney at Wise Carter, also serves as Gloster’s lawyer. She added that the incentives Piggly Wiggly received could help attract business in other places in Mississippi.

“In the future, I’m hoping that there will be other mechanisms that will help areas like Southwest Mississippi that encourage partnership (between towns and businesses),” she said.

Statewide solutions and the Legislature’s role

Much of the state — about 1 in 5, according to Hunger Free America — struggle with consistent access to nutritional food.

The phenomenon ranges from urban areas, like Hinds County, where 1 in 4 are food insecure, to rural areas like Jefferson County, which had the highest food insecurity rate in the country in 2016 at 36 percent, according to Feeding America.

Can the public-private partnership in Gloster work in the rest of the state? What can the state Legislature do to help?

Every year, lawmakers propose legislation ultimately aimed at reducing food insecurity by either helping grocers located in low-income communities mitigate losses or making groceries more affordable for the general public.

Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Jackson, has pushed for legislation to give tax credits to grocers locating in underserved communities. A 2018 bill would have given these stores a job tax credit equaling 10 percent of its payroll.

Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, authored a 2018 bill to give income tax credits to grocers to offset the cost of purchasing locally grown produce in an attempt to incentivize stores offering healthier food options.

Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, has introduced bills for the last several years to allow state funds to be used as a direct source of funding for grocery stores under the Small Business and Grocer Investment Act passed in 2014.

Each of these bills died in committee with little fanfare.

Simmons said his proposal to use state dollars directly is unlikely to garner the support of leadership. Tax incentives, similar to those Mississippi gives large companies like Nissan and Continental Tire, might be more palatable, Simmons said.

Right now, Mississippi is leveraging tax incentives for industries to locate in the state, but those benefits do not apply to businesses like grocers.

“Because of the number of employees, the kind of wages they’re paying, (grocers) wouldn’t qualify for the same type of incentives that an industry would,” Simmons said.

The federal government’s primary vehicle for providing at least some food to the poor is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly allowances based on the size of the recipient’s household. Mississippi has one of the largest federal matches of any state for these assistance programs.

“We in Mississippi have depended so much on the federal government to feed the hungry in the state that we ourselves are not focused on it,” Simmons said. “We have not stepped up to the plate to give adequate dollars to match that to help those citizens out of their particular situation … We’ve not had to.”

To slightly ease the burden of affording groceries for Mississippi residents, Rep. Jeramey Anderson, D-Escatawpa, repeatedly proposes legislation to remove the sales tax levied on food items for all shoppers. SNAP purchases are already exempt from sales tax. A version of the same bill from Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, would have also increased all other sales tax from seven to nine percent.

“In my opinion, the best way to provide a tax cut to our constituents, especially those in the middle and working class, is to eliminate this sales tax (on food),” said Anderson, who plans on reintroducing the bill next session. “And I know that of course there has to be a make-up of the revenue lost from taxes on groceries, but I think phasing it out, which is what this bill does over five years, is a responsible way of doing that without hitting the state’s revenue so hard. I think the sales tax on groceries is one of, if not the most, regressive taxes we have.”

Both bills also died, as well as several bills to raise the state minimum wage, which currently mirrors the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, to between $8.25 and $10.10.

Considering low wages across the state, Mississippi families cannot always rely on a job to provide food security. The “U.S. Hunger Atlas” also shows that nearly 13 percent of working adults, or 156,213 employees, also faced food insecurity between 2015 and 2017.

The report also calculated that Mississippi residents would need to spend an additional $273 million each year on food to meet their basic nutritional needs. That’s roughly one-third the amount Mississippi spent, $841.8 million, through the SNAP program in 2017.

“When you get into a situation and you do it for so long, it just becomes a way of life,” Simmons said. “If we do more at the state level, we could actually become a state of change, where we are transitioning our people from poverty to prosperity.”

At the Mississippi Center for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on racial and economic issues, Madeline Morcelle and Kathryn Rehner promote a wide-range of solutions to tackle the root causes of food insecurity.

“In order to achieve a food secure Mississippi, the state legislature will need to take on a broad range of social, economic, and physical barriers to healthy food access,” Morcelle said. “Those include everything from poverty, which is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of people still aren’t paid a living wage; measures to improve the minimum wage would improve food security. I think tax incentives and other measures to incentivize investments from food retailers are important.

“Ultimately, though, there isn’t one solution. It will take a combination of state reform addressing the multiplicity of factors that result in food insecurity, from lack of transportation, to inadequate income, to lack of opportunity in many communities, to protecting and strengthening our essential nutritional assistance programs like SNAP that provide that emergency lifeline to struggling families.”","But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving.

35,"Mar 23, 2018",,Mississippi high school students participate in World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute,"Contact: Vanessa Beeson

STARKVILLE, Miss. —More than a dozen high school students participated in the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute on Friday [March 23] at Mississippi State University.

Hosted by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, students from across Mississippi spent the day engaged in conversation about global food security with their peers, teachers, MSU faculty and administrators and various food security experts.

Attendees were officially designated Borlaug Scholars for their participation and are eligible for scholarships to Mississippi State University. The Borlaug Scholars pay tribute to the World Food Prize’s founder Norman E. Borlaug. To become a Borlaug Scholar, each student wrote a research paper about a developing country and a food security topic. Each project included innovative ways to improve global food security. The students presented their findings at the on-campus event.

“The Mississippi Youth Institute is a partnership program with the World Food Prize. It challenges high school students to explore the world’s most pressing issues related to food security,” said Libby Crimmings, the World Food Prize’s national education program director. “The World Food Prize’s founder, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was passionate about working with students. He believed if you want people solving these challenges when they are 60 years old, they have to be thinking about it when they are 16 years old.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a global food security champion, welcomed the students in an opening session.

“By 2050, the world population will surpass 10 billion. That means we will need to feed an additional 3 billion people at our global dinner table by the time this class of Borlaug Scholars reaches their 40s,” Keenum said. “That’s why we need young talented students like this who take an interest in the future of the world to try and make a difference, serve humanity and address these critical challenges.”

“It’s also why Mississippi State, as a leading land-grant research institution trained on improving food security on a global scale, is tackling many of these problems today. We are trying to address these challenges through science and research to figure out how we can advance productivity so we can feed the world.” Keenum added.

Scott Willard, associate dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, along with support from the entire MSU Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine administration, has been instrumental in seeing this institute come to fruition.

“Our college is thrilled to host the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute. Achieving global food security is essential as it becomes evident that we must feed more people with fewer resources,” Willard said. “This program provides a platform for high school students to formulate novel solutions to help solve one of the most pressing needs of their generation.”

Students also attended the college’s Charles E. Lindley Lecture. Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, presented on hunger in the Magnolia State. His presentation, “Mississippi: The Hungriest State in the Nation” explained how MFN is addressing food insecurity.

Top students from World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute will be invited to the Global Youth Institute in Iowa in October. Participating students also are eligible to apply to the Borlaug Ruan International Internship and the USDA Wallace-Carver Fellowship.

36,"Aug 15, 2019",Washington Post,"Investigators believe five poultry companies violated immigration law, search warrants say","Since 2002, federal officials have reported more than 350 encounters or arrests of undocumented people who said they worked at two of the plants, Koch Foods and Peco Foods.

AD

The companies for years have employed a stream of Guatemalan and Mexican immigrants who are not authorized to work in the United States, according to the search warrant affidavits, unsealed in federal court after Aug. 7 raids on seven plants operated by Koch Foods, Peco Foods, PH Food, A&B and Pearl River Foods. In the affidavits, Homeland Security Investigations agent Anthony Todd Williams Jr. said there is probable cause to believe that the chicken plants in Mississippi intentionally hired undocumented workers who presented fraudulent documents “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.”

Williams wrote that individuals or companies shown to have “actual knowledge” of violating the employment law — meaning they knowingly hired at least 10 people not authorized to work for a year-long period — can be fined as much as $3,000 per undocumented worker. Employers can be imprisoned for as long as six months.

Neither the companies nor any executives have been charged with violating immigration law, although the documents name numerous managers who apparently knew about the widespread practice, according to the affidavits recently unsealed in Mississippi federal court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out the raids at seven chicken-processing plants operated by the companies, arresting 680 workers, about half of whom have been released to await further hearings.

ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said no charges have been filed against either workers or employers since the raids.

“No federal law enforcement agency is going to speculate as to if/when any federal criminal charges may be filed … as that is the sole decision of the U.S. Attorney’s office,” he wrote in an email.

Mike Hurst, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, said in a statement that he could not comment on the case because the investigation is ongoing. “If you look at the history of this office, we have consistently prosecuted employers, companies and owners when evidence has been presented to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they have violated federal criminal laws.”

Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center, told The Washington Post that in his experience as a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer, such cases are time-consuming.

AD

“Federal agents no doubt seized servers, hundreds of personnel files and thousands of additional documents to be analyzed and considered by agents and federal prosecutors,” Johnson said. “The fact that no corporate officials were hauled out in handcuffs on the day of the raid is not the least bit surprising.”

AD

The records detail how ICE linked undocumented immigrants to the companies. Investigators found some employees via GPS coordinates at plants operated by all five companies. The employees previously had been arrested by Border Patrol agents in California, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona and released on electronic-monitoring programs, including ankle bracelets, to await court dates. In each case cited, the individuals listed addresses in small towns in central Mississippi where they could be located.

An undocumented Mexican woman working in a Peco Foods plant in Bay Springs, Miss., told immigration officials that she had come to the state because people in Mexico had told her that jobs were available at the chicken plants there.

AD

In cases cited in the affidavits, people on ICE’s electronic-monitoring programs were not authorized to work. But according to the affidavits, dozens of employees in such programs were found working at the seven chicken plants in 2018 and 2019. One successful job applicant was told by a supervisor during her interview that she would need to keep her ankle monitor charged while she worked.

AD

Immigration officials in Jackson, Miss., say they investigated the plants by working with employees who were acting as confidential informants, coordinating with local police on traffic stops and culling records from jails and detention centers, among other forms of surveillance.

Since 2008, Mississippi has required companies to use E-Verify, a federal employment verification system that checks an applicant’s information against a variety of federal databases. However, the system only checks the names, Social Security numbers and other information supplied by the applicant, so it cannot always detect whether an employee’s application uses falsified documents.

AD

Koch Foods, Peco Foods and PH Food issued public statements saying that they use the federal system, which compares an employee’s identity across databases. One of the search warrants lists the names of 25 PH Food employees whose names had not been run through E-Verify.

AD

On Friday, Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr and acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan asking for documents detailing the cost of the raids, information on the detained workers and any past or current criminal charges against the companies that employed them.

“It appears that these DOJ and ICE enforcement actions are targeting only immigrant workers and not their employers,” the letter reads.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) is one of the top two recipients in Congress of campaign contributions from the egg and poultry industry, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. The Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith’s campaign is a top recipient of donations from the National Chicken Council PAC, to which both Peco Foods and Koch Foods executives donate.

Hyde-Smith, a former Mississippi agriculture commissioner, did not respond to requests for comment from The Post.

Here’s what the newly unsealed federal documents allege about the five companies whose plants were raided Aug. 7:

Koch Foods

Headquartered near Chicago, privately held Koch Foods produces more than 700,000 tons of chicken products each year in its plant in Morton, Miss. The Koch Foods plant in Morton was raided after immigration officials said they received multiple tips that the plant knew it was employing immigrants not authorized to work in the United States.

Officials have reported 144 encounters, including arrests, since 2002 with undocumented immigrants who said they worked at a Koch Foods plant in Mississippi. ICE found that 21 employees of the Koch Foods plant in Morton are enrolled in the agency’s electronic-monitoring program, which tracks people who have been arrested on immigration violations and are awaiting court dates. Except in rare cases, such individuals are not authorized to work.

A Guatemalan woman who worked at the Morton plant since November 2016 told immigration officials in May that when she applied for employment, her first application was denied.

AD

AD

“She was told by a Human Resources (HR) employee (unidentified female) at the plant that if the ‘papers’ were not good, she was not going to be hired,” according to the affidavit by agent Williams.

About three weeks later, the woman used another name to send application materials to the same Koch human resources employee and was hired. “Even though she returned to the plant within three weeks and used two different identities, the HR employee did not ask anything related to her identity,” it says.

The Guatemalan woman told authorities that a Koch supervisor asked her whether she had an electronic-monitoring ankle bracelet, which she did. The supervisor told her “he knew ‘they’ were poor and came to the United States to work,” according to the affidavit.

AD

Officials also talked to a Guatemalan woman who said that she first worked at the Koch Foods plant in Morton in 2017. She received permission to work from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018 and asked a co-worker whether she should talk to human resources about changing her employment documents to reflect her real name. The co-worker advised her to quit and reapply instead. So she did and was hired the same day at the other Koch plant in Morton, with no questions about her identity.

AD

Koch spokesman Jim Gilliland told The Post that Koch Foods risked violating federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of national origin for requesting documents beyond what an applicant provides, if those materials appear authentic.

“Forms of identification can look completely authentic and jibe with the person who is sitting in front of us. … So you take what you’re given, and you enter that into the E-Verify system,” Gilliland said.

He said the company never knowingly employed people who presented false documentation to work.

This is not the first time federal immigration agents have raided a Koch Foods plant: 161 employees were arrested in 2007 at a plant in Fairfield, Ohio. The company paid a fine of more than $500,000 for violating immigration laws in 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Peco Foods

Alabama-based Peco Foods, the eighth-largest poultry producer in the country, operated three of the Mississippi processing plants raided last week. The privately operated company is headed by President Mark Hickman, whose grandfather founded the company in 1937.

“We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and are navigating a potential disruption of operations,” the company told The Post in a statement.

According to the search warrant affidavits, 21 people enrolled in the electronic-monitoring program are employed at Peco plants in Mississippi. Authorities had 222 encounters with undocumented Peco employees between 2002 and 2019, the affidavits state.

Officials linked at least seven undocumented Guatemalans to one of the plants, including a worker who said he worked there for 12 years.

Since 2012, immigration officials reported encountering at least five undocumented Mexicans and Guatemalans who said they worked at the Peco plants in Bay Springs and Canton, Miss. Federal investigators worked with a former employee at the company’s Bay Springs plant as a confidential informant to videotape a conversation with a Peco Foods human resources employee, who said the plant has hired multiple employees twice but with different identities.

According to the affidavit, the human resources employee told the informant: “Peco Foods management does not care” about employing immigrants with questionable documentation.

The affidavit lists ICE’s first contact with the Sebastopol plant as July 2014, when officials asked a human resources manager to locate a Guatemalan man using someone else’s name for his employment. ICE arrested the man and reported encounters with at least nine more undocumented Guatemalans between August 2015 and June 2019 who said they worked at the plant.

PH Food and A&B

In the affidavit, Williams states that two of the plants ICE raided last week are owned by the same man: Huo You Liang, also known as “Victor” Liang. The chicken-processing plants are A&B, in Pelahatchie, Miss., and PH Food, in Morton, Miss.

A man who answered the phone at PH Food on Thursday asked whether a reporter was calling and before hanging up said he could not answer questions. A&B did not respond to requests for comment.

PH Food, which lost dozens of workers to arrest Aug. 7, laid off another 100 workers on Monday without explanation, attorneys for several workers told The Post. It is unclear whether the layoffs are related to the raid. Former employees and their allies gathered in a Morton park on Tuesday for a demonstration.

Ahorita en Morton, MS la gente se ha reunido a protestar años de maltrató e injusticia tras la redada en PH Foods (Los Chinos). Posted by Mississippi Resiste on Tuesday, August 13, 2019

In February, an employee at PH Food gave immigration officials information showing that both plants were employing workers without legal documentation and that they use a payroll company in Louisiana to file the paperwork and shift the blame.

In May, officials recorded a conversation between the informant and Heather Carrillo, whom the affidavit lists as the secretary responsible for new employee paperwork at both plants. Carrillo told the informant that if immigration authorities had questions, she would direct them to Shreveport, La., where the payroll company is located, the affidavit states.

In May, immigration officials reviewed E-Verify records for the names and Social Security numbers given by 20 PH Food employees. They found that neither PH Foods nor its payroll provider had checked E-Verify for those names, even though the companies searched 1,000 other names in the system.

The Louisiana payroll company — PMI Resource — as well as PH Food and A&B “do not verify the authenticity of their documents,” according to the affidavit. Although E-Verify is federally a voluntary system, Mississippi state law requires companies to use E-Verify.

Despite the affidavit’s allegation that at least 20 employees’ names were not put through E-Verify, Carrillo told The Post last week that the business uses E-Verify in hiring. A woman who answered the phone at PMI Resource on Wednesday declined to answer questions.

Both the informant and an undocumented employee said 70 of 80 total employees at A & B’s plant were undocumented immigrants, most from Guatemala and a few from Mexico. The affidavit states that 224 of 240 PH Food workers are “suspected to be” undocumented, with 22 employees at the two plants enrolled in ICE’s electronic-monitoring program.

Pearl River Foods

The fifth company whose employees were swept up in the ICE raids, Pearl River Foods, opened its plant in Carthage, Miss., two years ago, and its success has been touted by the state’s governor.

When the Carthage plant handed over information about its 337 employees to immigration authorities in February, investigators allege they found some employees using the names and Social Security numbers of other people, including the deceased. Three months later, when ICE asked for the plant’s E-Verify list, 306 employees were listed as having been previously searched in the system.

The affidavit said 19 undocumented employees were enrolled in the electronic-monitoring program.

Pearl River opened its $2 million chicken-processing plant in 2017 and created 600 jobs within a year, according to a news release by the state economic development authority.

“The addition of so many new jobs by Pearl River Foods in Leake County speaks to the company’s commitment to doing business in Mississippi and to its strong belief in the people of our great state,” Gov. Phil Bryant (R) said at the time.","The Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith’s campaign is a top recipient of donations from the National Chicken Council PAC, to which both Peco Foods and Koch Foods executives donate.

37,"Sep 7, 2020",PBS NewsHour,"Southern Africa’s increased food insecurity blamed on climate, COVID-19","JOHANNESBURG (AP) — An estimated 45 million people in southern Africa are food insecure, with the number of people without access to adequate affordable and nutritious food up 10% from last year, the World Food Program said Monday.

The COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with climate change and the struggling economies of several countries, are the main causes of the food insecurity, said international aid organizations in a webinar organized by the Foreign Correspondents Association of Southern Africa.

Zimbabwe is the worst affected country, with its number of food insecure people expected to reach 8.6 million by the end of this year, World Food Program director in southern Africa, Lola Castro, said.

“We are going to see levels of food insecurity that we have never seen for many years,” in 13 of the region’s 16 countries, Castro said.

“We have chronic underlying causes that we know very well, and they are basically mostly related to climatic shocks … drought, floods or big cyclones,” said Castro.

WATCH: How the pandemic is making a global food crisis worse

She said COVID-19 was an additional emergency that has enormously hurt the livelihoods of many poor people in the region. Lockdowns have made large numbers of people unemployed, increasing food insecurity, she said.

Many farmers, especially women, had been severely affected by COVID-19 and its impact on food production, said ActionAid Africa humanitarian advisor, Chikondi Chabvuta.

“Southern Africa has faced impacts of climate change for the past four years nonstop. … I have witnessed the short-lived hope in people’s eyes these past four years when seeds are distributed or exchanged in the hope for a better yield next season, only to be disappointed by more climate disasters,” she said.

“COVID-19 is exposing the existing systematic weaknesses of the regional policies meant to develop resilient food security,” said Chabvuta. “This includes reliance on imports for agricultural production for food supply.”

Zimbabwean farmer Juliet Hove said lack of access to water and the markets were also major problems for small-scale farmers in her country.

According to Hove, COVID-19 restrictions on movements were preventing small-scale farmers from traveling to marketplaces to sell seeds and produce, reducing their ability to earn an income.","JOHANNESBURG (AP) — An estimated 45 million people in southern Africa are food insecure, with the number of people without access to adequate affordable and nutritious food up 10% from last year, the World Food Program said Monday.

38,"Sep 11, 2020",PBS NewsHour,1 in 10 Americans don’t have enough food. The pandemic is making things worse,"Tens of millions of Americans were already wrestling with having enough food to eat before the coronavirus came along. Enter a pandemic that launched an historic recession and experts say that need has only grown.

For three years, Jennifer Lawrence has volunteered at the food bank at St. Luke Methodist Church in Tupelo, Mississippi. People who come to her are scared, not only about having enough food but also how they’re going to make it from one day to the next in the middle of COVID-19, she said. One woman in her 70s is now raising her grandchildren after her own child died, Lawrence said.

“Some of them are at their wit’s end,” she said, adding that her clients tell her, “‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”

“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.'”

Data is starting to catch up to the real-life fallout of dueling health and economic crises, and shows that households of color and those with less income are disproportionately affected so far. In late August, about one in 10 Americans said they did not have enough food in the last seven days, according to new survey data from the Census Bureau out this week. But mounting data suggests those numbers are going up. The Census data also revealed rising in food insufficiency among children over the summer, from 16.8 percent in mid-June to 19.9 percent by mid-July.

In New York City and Los Angeles, roughly one-fifth of residents said over the course of July that they had serious difficulty getting enough food to eat. In Houston, a third of respondents had trouble affording food, according to a poll from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, NPR and Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health

And a slew of COVID-19 relief packages — from unemployment assistance to housing protection — are set to expire by the end of September, weeks ahead of the 2020 presidential election, leaving millions of people vulnerable to worse economic and health outcomes.

Food is one of the first costs people skimp on to try and stay afloat amid turbulent financial straits, and one of the last basic needs to recover once a crisis eases. What someone spends on food “is something that is elastic, as opposed to — your rent is your rent,” said Elaine Waxman, senior fellow at the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

That deprivation can have lasting effects — trouble getting enough food to eat can lay the foundation for chronic illness and reduced health outcomes later in life.

The PBS NewsHour asked health and social safety net experts where the United States stands on food insecurity, who is being hit hardest and what would help people get enough to eat during this crisis.

How we got here

Late last year, before the global rise of COVID-19, one out of 10 U.S. households was food insecure, according to a report published this week from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That amounts to an estimated 35.2 million people, said Alisha Coleman-Jensen, a USDA social science analyst who studies nutrition assistance.

More than half of those households — 58 percent — participated in at least one of the nation’s largest federal nutrition programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and the National School Lunch Program.

Rising unemployment and inflation of food prices are often linked to the number of food-insecure households, Coleman-Jensen said. However, “most food-insecure households are actually employed,” either full-time or part-time, suggesting people’s paychecks don’t go far enough to cover the cost of food, she said during a webinar highlighting the latest USDA report’s findings.

These numbers are comparable to what the Census Bureau found when it asked Americans if they had enough food during the last seven days. For months, the bureau has inquired how households are coping during the pandemic with questions about job status, housing, food, health care and more.

But the way that question is framed could gloss over the realities of food insecurity, which tends to be episodic during the course of a month, Waxman said. People may be fine once they get money or assistance on the first of the month, but by the end of the month, their cash reserves or resources may have dried up. That’s why polls often ask if people have experienced hunger or food insecurity over the last 30 days.

For many in the U.S., financial stability has grown more tenuous in the months since the pandemic began, and could get more dire. With the latest GOP Senate coronavirus relief bill scuttled on Thursday, essentially diminishing hopes of any aid coming before the November election, and federal COVID-19 unemployment insurance set to expire after Dec. 31, more people are struggling to figure out how they will pay rent and eat, Waxman said. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed a federal moratorium on evictions, people are still worried about how they are going to make ends meet. Back in Tupelo, Lawrence said clients come to her and say they don’t know how they can afford rent.

In a year full of examples of the ways systemic racism manifests in all aspects of life, from COVID-19 outcomes to police brutality, food insecurity has also weighed more heavily on Black and brown households than white ones, said Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The health care policy organization, along with partners, surveyed 3,454 Americans between July 1 and Aug. 3 in the nation’s four largest cities — New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston — to see how vulnerable people’s lives and livelihoods have become amid the pandemic. The report detailed how problems were concentrated among Black and Latino households and households with incomes less than $100,000 per year in cities that report some of the nation’s highest cost-of-living. At least half of respondents in each city reported serious financial problems, including trouble paying bills, especially due to medical costs or credit card debt, and fleeced savings.

“Food security is really a basic and fundamental need, and we shouldn’t be experiencing these kinds of problems,” Morita said.

On the ground

After COVID-19 surged in places like New York City and California, it settled into rural pockets of the country over the summer, searing states like Mississippi with some of the country’s worst positivity rates, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Mississippians still suffered among the higher unemployment rates in the country with 10.8 percent of the labor force out of work. And like much of the rest of the country, a disproportionate number of Black Mississippians died after they were infected with the virus, compared to white Mississippians, according to the state department of public health.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry.”

Things got so bad that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves finally issued a statewide face mask mandate on Aug. 4, but stopped short of postponing the start of in-person school days later for thousands of Mississippi children, teachers and staff. Less than a month after classes began, the Mississippi Free Press reported on Aug. 25 that thousands were ordered to stay out of classrooms after hundreds of COVID-19 tests confirmed positive cases in the state’s school system. In the 2019-2020 school year, the USDA said about 357,000 children in Mississippi were qualified to be fed through the National School Lunch Program. That translates to nearly three-quarters of all children in the state’s participating schools.

Mississippi households reported the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity at 15.7 percent late last year, according to the latest USDA data. Since then, Jason Martin has already seen a spike in need at the food pantries he oversees in Northeast Mississippi. As executive director for the Tupelo/Lee County Hunger Coalition, Martin said older residents, who are at greater risk for suffering worse outcomes if infected with COVID-19, fear coming to the pantries to pick up food. At the same time, hundreds of new households are flocking to the food bank because so many people have lost their jobs or been furloughed.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry,” Martin said. He said while the pantry typically restricts people to one visit per month, Martin said he has seen an uptick in people who run out and need more food sooner.

Around the nation, more than four out of 10 people who sought help from food pantries were new and needed services as a result of COVID-19, according to Feeding America, a nonprofit network of more than 200 food banks. Based on what he has seen, Martin said he doesn’t expect food pantry demand to return to pre-pandemic numbers “until 2021, until a vaccine is widely available. You’ve got to see that widely available to the community before things start stabilizing.”

What’s next?

Waxman said she foresees “a real uptick in food insecurity and need” for months, if not years. It took Americans a decade to recover from food insecurity brought on by the Great Recession, she said.

The U.S. didn’t enter this coronavirus-fueled recession completely unprepared. During the 2008 financial crisis, lessons were learned that gave policymakers evidence-based tools and strategies to make sure more Americans get enough nutritious food to eat, she said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping. That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”

One tool they used to stem widespread hunger in the U.S. was boosting food stamp benefits across the board, Waxman said. That gave more food to more people when they needed it, and research supports this tactic for avoiding hunger. That’s why it was included in the HEROES Act, Waxman said, but that coronavirus relief package, which was introduced by House Democrats in May, has sat in Congress.

Research shows that cash infusions, such as the extended $600 payments that went out under the CARES Act passed in March, are vital in keeping American households financially afloat and fed, Waxman said. During the Great Recession, individuals received more than $420 billion in stimulus payments, which helped keep households afloat and prevent further job loss, the Hamilton Project reported.

To fix holes in the social safety net, Waxman urged lawmakers to be more consistent with aid. So far in the crisis, the U.S. has adopted a series of policies that weren’t renewed. One example, she said, was authorizing pandemic EBT, or a special debit card used to redeem food benefits, under the CARES Act, which replaced free or reduced price school meals for children who couldn’t return to the classroom because of COVID-19 and would miss free-or-reduced price breakfast and lunch. This benefit is set to expire on Sept. 30. According to the USDA, roughly 30 million children rely on the National School Lunch Program. But because the U.S. has created a patchwork of state, local and federal responses to a global pandemic, more households are falling through the cracks, Waxman said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping,” she said. “That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”","I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it.

39,"Nov 12, 2020",,Some U.S. states hit harder by COVID-19 food insecurity,"Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic. But large regional differences exist in the severity of the impact.

Experts project over 50 million Americans will be food insecure in 2020, including about 17 million children, says Craig Gundersen, ACES distinguished professor in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois.

Gundersen estimated food insecurity using Map the Meal Gap, an interactive model he developed for Feeding America, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks in the U.S. For the current report, he combined MMG data with projected unemployment numbers.

""One of the key things about COVID-19 is how there's differential impacts across the country and by demographic groups. People with college education generally have not seen much of an impact on either unemployment rates or incomes. However, people in lower-wage jobs tend to be impacted a lot more,"" Gundersen states. ""We would expect greater impact of COVID-19 in areas with a high concentration of service industry jobs.""

The report finds the hardest hit states are the same as before the pandemic -- Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico - but with higher rates. Jefferson County, Mississippi, has the highest food insecurity rate, 30.4%, in the country.

However, the pandemic disproportionately affected other states. For example, Nevada jumped from 20th to eighth highest food insecurity rate by state.

""Areas like Nevada, which has a strong emphasis on the service industry and tourism, will have substantially higher rates of increase in food insecurity than areas with fewer service sector workers,"" Gundersen says.

These findings can help direct relief efforts, he notes.

""Resources should continue to be directed towards those areas with greater needs before, during, and after COVID-19. But we also have to recognize that during the pandemic situation there are areas of the country, such as Nevada, which may need more emergency assistance in the near term,"" Gundersen says.

""Furthermore, some of these jobs may not come back; tourism may be permanently down in the United States. So these impacts could also have longer term ramifications,"" he concludes.","Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As Americans scattered to the privacy of their homes this week to avoid spreading the coronavirus, the opposite scene was playing out in the Mexican city of Monterrey.

A thousand or more young men arrived in the city, as they do most weeks of the year, filling up the cheap hotels, standing in long lines at the U.S. Consulate to pick up special H-2A visas for temporary agricultural workers, then gathering in a big park to board buses bound for farms in the United States.

""I spoke with people going to North Carolina, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi,"" says Justin Flores, vice president of the AFL-CIO's Farm Labor Organizing Committee, who was in Monterrey for meetings. ""[They were] headed to destinations all over the country to provide really important labor that supports the backbone of our economy, which is the agricultural industry.""

About 250,000 workers came to the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, the majority of them from Mexico. They've become an increasingly important piece of America's food industry.

Late in the day on Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City announced that it is suspending nonemergency visa appointments because of concerns for the health of its employees and visitors.

At the same time, though, the embassy notified farm employers that many — perhaps most — of these farm workers still can get their visas, because they participated in the program last year and don't require an in-person appointment at the consulate.

Ryan Ogburn, visa director at wafla, which helps farms manage the flow of H-2A workers in the Pacific Northwest, says that 85-90% of their workers will qualify for this exemption. Meanwhile, influential farm organizations in the U.S. are pushing the Trump administration to ease the entry of more guest workers.

The continuing availability of agricultural workers illustrates the paradox of America's food supply in the age of COVID-19.

One end of the food supply chain has been completely upended as restaurants go dark and consumers prowl half-empty aisles of supermarkets. Food producers, though, are operating almost as normal — at least for now.

Slaughterhouses, dairies and vegetable producers say that they are open for business, ready to feed the nation. Howard Roth, president of the National Pork Producers Council, wrote in a statement that ""telecommuting is not an option for us; we are reporting for work as always.""

Food distributors and wholesalers in the middle of that supply chain, meanwhile, are trying to perform logistical miracles, redirecting truckloads of food from shuttered businesses toward places where people now crave it — mainly grocery stores.

""There's nothing 'as usual' anymore,"" says Mark Levin, CEO of M. Levin and Co., a fruit and vegetable wholesaler in Philadelphia. Levin normally sells lots of bananas to schools and restaurants, and ""unfortunately, all those people, last minute, say, 'I'm sorry, I can't use this fruit. You must take it back, or don't deliver it.' And that's tough, because we've already got it in the system ripening and ready to sell,"" Levin says.

Can he send those bananas instead to grocery stores that are out of stock? ""Yes, but at a reduced price,"" Levin says.

The problem, Levin says, is that different customers want slightly different things. Schools and other institutions buy boxes of loose ""petite"" bananas, with 150 bananas in a box. ""Grocery stores don't want those,"" he says.

At least people are still eating. Drinking is a different story.

""We're losing a lot of occasions, regular things like birthday parties or weddings, where people normally get together,"" says Stephen Rannekleiv, who follows the beverage sector for RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness.

""For the beverage world, those are occasions for consumption. We're losing some of those,"" Rannekleiv says. He notes that in China, overall demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen by about 10% during the coronavirus crisis.

There's an even bigger worry hanging over the food industry: The prospect of workers testing positive for COVID-19.

When it happens, the response likely will go beyond sending that individual home — although that alone can be catastrophic to field workers who are paid, in part, based on their production. This week, the United Farm Workers union called on employers to expand paid sick leave for workers.

Vegetable growers are considering policies that would require quarantine for everyone who worked in close proximity to the infected person. That could easily include two dozen or more people. Workers on H-2A visas often live together, sharing kitchens and bedrooms and traveling together on buses. The virus could spread quickly, and measures to stop it will be extremely costly.

According to Steve Alameda, a vegetable grower in Yuma, Ariz., losing an entire 30-person work crew overnight will be extremely disruptive. Farmworkers already are hard to find, and replacing so many people immediately could prove impossible.

""We've got enough disruption,"" Alameda says. ""We don't need to disrupt our food supply, that would be really catastrophic.""","About 250,000 workers came to the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, the majority of them from Mexico.

During World War II, approximately 40% of recruits couldn’t enlist due to poor nutrition. Today, over 70% of would-be recruits are ineligible for a number of contributing factors, including nutrition and obesity. It’s become a matter of national security, according to an organization of retired generals.

""Seventy years ago, a military leader said a lack of nutritional food in our children and young adults contributed to military readiness,"" said retired Army Maj. Gen. Larry Harrington. ""We've made some improvements but we have a long, long way to go.""

Mission: Readiness is a national group made up of over 75 retired admirals and general across the country that focuses on helping children stay in school, in shape and out of trouble. The organization issued a report Wednesday, Improving Childhood Nutrition in Mississippi, that highlighted the need for federally funded programs that give children access to fresh and healthy food.

Wednesday morning, three generals from Mission: Readiness met with agencies from across Mississippi in a roundtable discussion in Jackson about child nutrition.

Nationally, 72% of those 17 to 24 years old are not able to qualify for the military due to lack of education, criminal background, substance abuse or medical disqualifiers. Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility in the nation, with 76% of eligible 17- to 24- year-olds not being able to qualify, said retired Army Brig. Gen. Roger Shields.

Obesity is one of the leading disqualifiers, he said. Twenty-five percent of 10- to 17- year-olds were obese in the state in 2018, while 40% of adults were obese.

""We believe that America must prioritize efforts to combat childhood obesity as a matter of national security,"" Shields said in a written statement released after the roundtable. ""Improving access to fresh and nutritious foods for all children will help reduce childhood obesity and ultimately ensure that the military has a pool of recruits.""

There is a ""network"" of federal nutrition programs available across Mississippi working to combat the issue but many don't know what is available to them, said retired Army Maj. Gen. Augustus Collins, a former adjutant general of Mississippi.

Collins cited the National School Lunch Program, Summer Food Service Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

According to the Mission: Readiness report, in 1945, Gen. Lewis Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, testified in front of Congress that at least 40% of recruits were rejected during World War II for reasons released to poor nutrition.

The National School Lunch program was founded the following year ""to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals,"" Collins said.

Recalling Hershey's testimony, Collins said, ""The lack of nutritious food for our children is actually a threat to national security.""

""It was back in World War II and it is today,"" he said.

Statistics: Nutrition, obesity and the military

In Mississippi, 76% of youth between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot serve in the military due to issues such as lack of education, a record of crime or substance abuse, or medical disqualifiers; higher than the national average of 71%.

Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility among all 50 states.

Obesity is one of the main medical disqualifiers. Individuals who would otherwise be eligible to serve in the military are being disqualified due to excess weight.

In Mississippi, nearly 40% of adults and 25% of children ages 10-17 were obese in 2018, the highest in the nation. In some counties, the percentage increases to 45.

Mississippi has the second highest rate of child food insecurity in the country. In 2016, over 24% of Mississippi children experienced food insecurity. The national average is 18 percent.

Between 2015 and 2017, over 17% of all households in Mississippi experienced food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at a higher rate for obesity.

Mississippi has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country at 17%.

In Mississippi, 37,000 participants, or 7% of National School Lunch Program participants, accessed the Summer Food Service Program, meaning a large majority of students may not have access to healthy food during the summer break.

More than a dozen states have programs to link farmers with food banks, and many have scaled up efforts in response to the pandemic. Elaine Thompson/The Associated Press

Read Stateline coverage of the latest state action on coronavirus.

Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify the California Department of Food and Agriculture's role in the Farm to Family program.

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a longstanding initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and supported by the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

“All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,” said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. “When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.”

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts Quick View Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts A U.S.-China trade deal is falling short on its commitments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don’t have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic’s early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

“If food banks can’t take more product [from the California program], farmers are going to go out of business,” Linkhart said. “That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.”

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

“That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,” said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. “It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.”

Raudabaugh said the state’s dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers’ distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don’t make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

“We’re providing many hundreds of percents more [to food banks] than pre-pandemic,” Raudabaugh said. “Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these [partnerships]. It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.”

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

“The money has to be there to justify the harvest,” Michael said, “and this solves some of that problem.”

Washington’s Work

On Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen’s small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers’ pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

“It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,” Van Laanen said. “It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.”

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he’s already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi’s Farm stay afloat.

“It was really timely,” Chichester said. “It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early timeframe.”

Karen Affeld, the development group’s executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

“Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,” she said. “That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.”

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state’s Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California’s that launched in 2014.

It’s a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they’re harvesting crops bound for food banks.

“Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,” said David Bobanick, the group’s executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another four pounds are donated by farmers.

“Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,” he said. “It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.”

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

“Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,” said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets’ food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she’s heard from parents who couldn’t otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

Making Connections

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture — known as CSA — in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program’s website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

“You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,” said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. “People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.”

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

“We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,” Lebeaux said. “Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.”

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

“We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,” said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. “One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.”

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

“If there’s one silver lining,” she said, “it’s that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.”","And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State University will lead a new $15 million U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiative that continues efforts to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for global populations dependent on aquaculture-led economies.

USAID funding over five years will create the Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish, which MSU will lead through the university’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security under the direction of Mark Lawrence, associate dean and professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

MSU President Mark E. Keenum called the new USAID partnership “groundbreaking” and said the university is “well-positioned to lead this important effort.”

“Our relationship with USAID is a long and fruitful one that underscores Mississippi State’s position as a leading agricultural research university,” said Keenum. “It also speaks specifically to the quality of research and scholarship in our College of Veterinary Medicine.”

U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper provided leadership to help MSU secure the grant.

“I look forward to seeing the results of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish at Mississippi State University, which will help USAID reduce hunger and poverty around the world,” Wicker said. “As the national leader in aquaculture and fisheries research, the university and our state are uniquely suited to host this project. All Mississippians should take pride in the establishment of this innovation lab.”

The Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish is an interdisciplinary program aimed at reducing poverty and improving nutrition, food security and livelihoods among stakeholders in targeted regions. The lab is not a specific site, but a mechanism through which academic, private and public partners can identify solutions for global challenges.

Known as the Fish Innovation Lab, the project will implement integrated aquaculture and fisheries programs in developing countries. Fish are rich in critical micronutrients and are among the most traded agricultural commodities in the world, but more research is needed on ways developing countries can maximize this global resource for the health and economic growth of their populations. The Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish will conduct research focusing on improved production, reducing and mitigating risk to fish production systems and improving human outcomes.

“Being successful in the competition to lead the USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish is reflective of the many years faculty from several MSU colleges have worked on fish health and production issues,” said Kent Hoblet, Dean of MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “I look forward to seeing the impact that MSU and our College of Veterinary Medicine will have on reducing hunger and improving lives in the developing countries where the program will take us.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, who holds an MSU doctoral degree in agricultural economics and who served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has made global food security a university research priority during his tenure at MSU.

The initial focus for project activities will be on regions deemed priority areas for aquaculture and fisheries development by the Feed the Future and USAID: West Africa, East Africa, and Asia. Initial work will take place at the local level to develop best practices that can be scaled to national and regional levels.

“The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish is an important part of MSU’s overall strategy to provide leadership in providing solutions for global food security and livelihoods in priority countries,” Lawrence said. “The College of Veterinary Medicine is proud to contribute expertise to help lead this program.”

The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish utilizes a “Leader with Associates” model, through which MSU will facilitate associate awards to research and development partners. As the lead and management entity, MSU will identify and manage a portfolio of investments for research and development activities that address both promising innovations and emerging challenges in aquaculture and fisheries through an integrated approach of blending multiple disciplines.

As a platform for innovation, the project will connect the expertise and capacity of a consortium of public and private organizations, government research agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs,) domestic and international universities, as well as small farm associations within the target countries.

MSU is recognized as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health by the World Food Programme and the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. The university’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security works to addresses challenges facing aquaculture and find solutions to meeting the world’s food security needs while ensuring a safe supply of seafood.

MSU is Mississippi’s leading university, available online at www.msstate.edu.

45,"Dec 21, 2019",NPR,New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion,"New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Danny Moloshok/AP Danny Moloshok/AP

Some low-income college students are among the 688,000 food stamp recipients projected to lose benefits as a result of a Trump administration rule announced Dec. 4. While the rule explicitly targets ""able-bodied adults without dependents,"" it also limits food assistance for a share of college students at a time when campuses across the country are grappling with how to respond to food insecurity.

The new rule makes it harder for states to waive the requirement that adults work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — benefits. Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.

""As long as a student is at least half-time, they are not considered an [able-bodied adult without dependents] subject to SNAP work requirements, so that new rule would not impact them,"" says Kathryn Larin, director of the Education Workforce and Income Security Team at the Government Accountability Office. ""The group that it would impact would be students enrolled less than half-time.""

Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

This is because Congress created the program with the image of a ""traditional"" student in mind: someone entering college directly from high school, financially reliant on their parents, with no income or dependents.

But this archetype is far from universal, says Parker Gilkesson, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy who specializes in income and work supports. Only about 1 in 4 students attend a four-year institution immediately after high school.

Many college students are older or are parents themselves. And few have a financial safety net: Countless families are spending all they have just to send their children to college, let alone pay for their food and other necessities, she says.

""[Congress] did recognize there are circumstances where students could and should be eligible for SNAP, and so they set up a number of exceptions from this prohibition against college students getting SNAP,"" Larin said. ""What are those exemptions, who is eligible for them, how do you meet those exemptions? That's where the confusion comes in.""

In order for college students to be eligible for SNAP, they must first meet income and asset limits, household qualifications and immigration status requirements. Those who are enrolled less than half of the time — as defined by their school — can then qualify under standard SNAP rules.

Students enrolled more than half of the time may qualify for SNAP by meeting one of a number of criteria, which include being responsible for a dependent child younger than 6, working at least 20 hours a week in paid employment, receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, participating in an on-the-job training program, being outside the 18-49 age range, and being unable to work for health reasons.

""No matter if they're full time, part time, half time, even taking one class, [students] are taking the initiative to really better themselves and grow and further their academic career,"" Gilkesson says. ""They shouldn't be punished for not being able to find steady employment in the economy that we are in today.""

Gilkesson says it is unclear exactly how many students will lose benefits as a result of the new rule, particularly because able-bodied adults without dependents are not necessarily also classified as students if they are enrolled part time. But she adds it is clear that the rule will disproportionately impact young people, people of color and those who struggle to find employment, leaving them without much-needed food assistance.

""Most people who receive SNAP who can work, do work,"" she says. ""But there are a lot of jobs and specifically low-wage jobs out here that have volatile schedules ... people can be let go at any time, so we shouldn't allow people to go hungry just based on their ability to maintain work.""

According to National Center for Education Statistics data on unduplicated year-round enrollment, 5.8 million students were enrolled in public two-year colleges in fall 2017. About 2.1 million were full time, and 3.7 million were part time. Gilkesson says that while there are more students enrolled part time in community colleges than in four-year institutions, food insecurity exists on all types of campuses.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat. This was among the findings of a 2018 Government Accountability Office report that also said almost 2 million at-risk students who were potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits in 2016.

Only 4 in 10 students who are potentially eligible for SNAP are actually enrolled in the program, according to Gilkesson. This is due to perceived stigma as well as confusion about who can apply for SNAP and how to do so.

""The information that's available from the USDA ... is difficult to find on their website and also hard to understand, it's very legal language,"" says Larin, adding that people whose jobs it is to connect college students with these resources may struggle to understand the criteria. Advocates worry that the new rule will exacerbate this confusion.

The GAO report released last December made two recommendations: that the Food and Nutrition Service (which is part of U.S. Department of Agriculture) improve the information on its website to make it easier to find and understand, and that it take a more active role in sharing states' best practices for connecting students to SNAP. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations but has not yet implemented them as of mid-December 2019.

Gilkesson received SNAP in college and was a SNAP worker at a county agency in North Carolina prior to her current job. She says it was not until she saw the other side of the ""intricate"" process that she realized how much information she never received as a student, both because she didn't know what to tell workers and because they didn't always know what to ask.

As a SNAP worker, she saw the impact that fresh food and hot meals had on clients' lives.

""You need food to live, you need food to work, you need food to thrive,"" Gilkesson says. ""And hunger does not make people more employable either.""

In fact, she adds, hunger makes it harder for people to find well-paying jobs that align with their skills and often leads to cycles of being laid off, having to find a new job quickly and missing out on the opportunity to gain the education, training and skills necessary for more meaningful and sustainable employment.

She says research shows that SNAP encourages work and that the idea that people experiencing poverty don't want to get jobs is ""implicit bias.""

The Trump administration says the new rule is intended to promote SNAP recipients entering the workforce. Critics have slammed the change for eliminating food assistance for nearly 700,000 people, many of whom already struggle to find work.

Gilkesson says it is concerning that college students will lose benefits, but the prevalence of food insecurity should be an issue regardless of who is experiencing it.

""No one should be hungry,"" she says. ""That's a basic necessity. And when we start to think about it in that way, we really will start to see the policy change that we need to see.""

Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.
Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat."
46,"Dec 21, 2020",CNBC,Lawmakers allocate $13 billion to food assistance programs in an effort to alleviate hunger crisis,"Lawmakers agreed to a $900 billion coronavirus relief package on Sunday, which includes $13 billion in funding to support food assistance programs, at a time when demand and lines at food pantries around the country are reaching record levels.

About 13% of Americans, or 27.4 million people, reported they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat on a weekly basis, according to the latest Household Pulse Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 16. About 14 million households with children report not having enough to eat.

It's a situation lawmakers hope to improve. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a hunger crisis that has touched every part of our nation,"" Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry said in a statement Sunday. ""I am relieved that help is on the way and I look forward to continuing to do more in the new year to help Americans through this continuing crisis.""

Sunday's funding deal includes a 15% increase to the maximum SNAP benefits for six months through June 30, 2021, a move that many advocates were calling for. The increase amounts to a boost of about $25 per person each month.

The average SNAP benefit per person was $125 per month during the fiscal year 2020, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's about $1.39 per person per meal.

Roughly 6 to 7 million more people have applied and been approved for SNAP benefits since February, according to available data analyzed by CBPP. Nationally, that's about a 17% increase. About 25.3 million Americans total reported currently receiving SNAP benefits in the latest Census Household Pulse survey.

The latest relief package also expands SNAP eligibility to college students and excludes unemployment benefits from being counted as income when it comes to SNAP benefits. Additionally, U.S. territories including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa — which are not eligible for SNAP — will receive $614 million for nutrition grants.

The bill will also expand food access for children, including allowing any child under 6 to be deemed ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits under the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program. The program provides families with a voucher to purchase groceries to replace the breakfasts and lunches their children miss when schools and child-care centers are closed or only offering remote learning.

Congress reauthorized the program on Oct. 1, but it took the U.S. Department of Agriculture six weeks to establish the new guidelines for the program, meaning that states only started applying for funds this month.

Under the latest bipartisan deal, food banks also will receive $400 million in funding through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, will receive $175 million.

""Our network of member food banks across the country are witnessing unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for charitable food assistance,"" Kate Leone, Feeding America's chief government relations officer, said in a statement last week. ""Families are making impossible decisions between paying the rent and putting food on the table while food banks are working tirelessly to keep up with the increased need.""

The $13 billion in funding would provide ""limited but immediate help,"" Leone said, adding that more federal funding and assistance would likely be needed in the future. ""As always, and especially during this crisis, the simple truth is that charity alone cannot solve food insecurity.""

47,"Nov 19, 2020",U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Newsroom,ICE executes federal search warrants at multiple Mississippi locations,"JACKSON, Miss. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) executed multiple federal criminal search warrants at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi Wednesday morning as part of an ongoing HSI worksite enforcement criminal investigation.

In addition to executing federal search warrants and seizing business records pertaining to the ongoing federal criminal investigation, deportation officers with ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in partnership with HSI detained approximately 680 removable aliens who were unlawfully working at the plants.

All the unlawfully present foreign nationals arrested Wednesday are being interviewed by ICE staff to record any potential mitigating humanitarian situations. Based on these interviews, and consideration of their criminality and prior immigration history, ICE is determining on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the circumstances which individuals will be detained and which persons may be released from custody at present. In all cases, all the illegal aliens encountered as part of this operation are either being placed into removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts, and for those who already received due process and have been ordered removed, processed for removal from the U.S.

A 24-hour toll-free hotline is available for family members of those arrested in this operation to address questions about their detention location and status, and the removal process. This hotline operates in English and Spanish; the phone number is 1-855-479-0502.

This HSI-led operation was conducted in coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi, of which U.S. Attorney D. Michael Hurst Jr. will prosecute any resulting federal criminal charges.

HSI is the federal law enforcement agency responsible for upholding the laws established by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which requires employers to verify the identity and work eligibility of individuals they hire. These laws help protect jobs for U.S. citizens and lawful U.S. residents, eliminate unfair competitive advantages for companies that unlawfully hire an illegal workforce, and strengthen public safety and national security.

Unauthorized workers often use stolen identities of legal U.S. workers, which can profoundly damage for years the identity-theft victim’s credit, medical records and other aspects of their everyday life.

HSI’s worksite enforcement investigators help combat worker exploitation, illegal wages, child labor and other illegal practices. Worksite enforcement investigations often involve additional criminal activity, such as alien smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering, document fraud, worker exploitation and/or substandard wage and working conditions.

In addition to worksite enforcement operations like this one, HSI also uses I-9 audits to create a culture of compliance among employers. In July 2018, ICE announced a two-phase operation under this effort.","– U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) executed multiple federal criminal search warrants at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi Wednesday morning as part of an ongoing HSI worksite enforcement criminal investigation.

48,"Nov 5, 2020",BetaBoston,Study: A million people in Mass. don’t have enough food,"Massachusetts has seen the highest percent increase of residents facing food insecurity of all states, according to new projections released by Feeding America last Friday. The hunger rate in the state has increased 59 percent since 2018, representing more than 1 million people who are now struggling to get enough to eat. The child food-insecurity rate has also worsened, with one in five children in Massachusetts now living in food-insecure households, a 102 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 levels. (Norfolk County in Massachusetts has the highest percent change in child food-insecurity in the country, with a 163 percent increase in 2020 versus 2018.)

As the country awaits the returns of the presidential election and any prospects of another economic stimulus bill, one thing has remained consistent amid the pandemic: People in Massachusetts are going hungry. And the problem is only growing.

The overall food insecurity rate in Massachusetts is projected to reach 14.2 percent this year. The highest rates in the United States will be in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, which could each have more than 20 percent of their citizens facing hunger. And California is predicted to have 6.2 million people who are having trouble getting enough to eat, the largest total number of any state in the country.

“The need isn’t going anywhere,” said Catherine Drennan, the director of public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, which served over 600,000 people in September, a 120 percent increase over last year.

November and December are typically some of the busiest months for local food banks, but the combined economic, political, and public health crises facing the Commonwealth will make this year unlike any other, said Drennan. She said the food bank is planning to provide 20 million meals as part of its annual Hunger Free Holidays campaign.

New issues with a federal food-distribution program have stoked anxieties further among local organizations working to provide food to those in need. Back in May, as part of the CARES Act, the USDA launched its $4.5 billion Farmers to Families Food Box program, working with US farmers to purchase and distribute boxes of agricultural products. During the first three rounds of the program, several vendors in New England were awarded eight-week contracts, and each built a network of local distributors to hand out hundreds of thousands of prepacked boxes filled with dairy, meat, and produce.

Many of the boxes ended up being distributed to local nonprofits — like the Brazilian Workers Center in Allston — which are operating outside the established regional food bank networks, having launched or expanded emergency food services as they saw the need in their communities.

“Since COVID-19, we’ve had to repurpose our regular services to meet food insecurity in the community,” said the Brazilian Workers Center’s executive director, Natalicia Tracy. “The Boston food banks weren’t equipped to handle the demand, and we saw a huge increase in need for food in Allston. So the USDA boxes were really critical.” The Brazilian Workers Center now feeds 500 families each week.

But the execution of the food box program has been fraught. Farmers who won contracts and planted crops for the program were left high and dry when they weren’t chosen as vendors in subsequent rounds. In some parts of the country, there were concerns about the nutritional value of the goods included in the boxes. The USDA also faced blowback last month after President Trump required that a signed letter from him be included in each box.

In the agency’s latest funding round announced last Friday, no Massachusetts vendors were awarded contracts. This will likely mean significant delays in getting the next round of local food distributions up and running, leaving partner organizations like Tracy’s scrambling to find sources for food as they head toward Thanksgiving. So earlier this week, she headed back to the store. “We’ve already purchased 1,200 pounds of rice, beans, and pasta, and some produce. We’re still trying to figure out whatever we can get our hands on,” she said.

Those who have been working with the USDA say that the changes will put undue pressure on the Massachusetts food bank system during its busiest season.

“In two weeks these pantries are going to burn through whatever dry goods they have in back stock,"" said Sean Buchanan, the vice president of sales at Costa Fruit and Produce, one of the local distributors whose vendor contract with the USDA was not renewed. He said Costa handed out more than 889,000 food boxes to 400 partners since the program launched, only to have to turn off the faucet for the distributions on Monday.

“It’s a perfect storm for food insecurity,"" he said.

The USDA’s decision also forced produce distributor Katsiroubas Bros. to lay off 40 staff members overnight, said Torry Katsiroubas Stamm, the company’s president. Over the past several months, the Boston-based distributor had set up an elaborate supply chain and partnered with the nonprofit Boston Area Gleaners to deliver more than 10 million pounds of food to nonprofits, public housing sites, and food banks throughout New England, she said. The program has helped keep her business afloat as her restaurant and food service accounts have cut back on orders amid the pandemic.

Now, that supply chain has been upended, and a new company in Long Island, N.Y., has been given the contract and has to start over creating a distribution plan from scratch, she said.

“Our partners have been calling us, and we don’t have anything to tell them,” Katsiroubas said. “They’re panicked."" She said she feels the same level of stress she heard from her customers back in March, “with everyone saying ‘What do we do?' We’re still here, it feels like it’s happening again.”

“Before this program got up and running, we saw a lot of nonprofits that had never moved food or dealt with food moving thousands of boxes or grocery bags a week,” said Dylan Frazier, the director of strategy for the Boston Area Gleaners, which worked as both a vendor and partner with local distributors to make USDA food box deliveries. “We’re telling people you have to call the food bank, we don’t have any food for you,” he said. “People are flipping out. It’s panic mode. There’s still a line of a thousand or two thousand people with no food.”

Food pantry lines have already been getting longer over the past several months at the Salvation Army of Chelsea and East Boston, said Captain Isael Gonzalez, who oversees the emergency food program there. So, having to wait for the USDA program to restart with new vendors from out of state means he’s now struggling to serve the 700 families that seek out his services daily.

“Through the USDA program, we’ve been distributing over 2,100 boxes each week to families out of our office, and the good part is the boxes come prepacked, and there’s no labor on our end,” Gonzales said. “Not having those boxes is going to have a huge impact: It’s more trips to the Greater Boston Food Bank, more relying on local donations from different resources, and a lot of labor intensity on our part too.”

Ultimately, the USDA Food Box program provides just a small percentage of the overall food assistance currently in place in the region. But “we’ll take every food source we can and it’s definitely helpful,” Drennan, of the Greater Boston Food Bank, said. More importantly, she added, the program is set to expire by year’s end, and “unless another stimulus package comes out and they decide to renew, I don’t know what will happen.”

(CNN) —

Someone gained access to the Ring security camera of a Mississippi family and used the speaker feature to harass their 8-year-old daughter, telling her he was Santa Claus and encouraging her to destroy the room.

The horrifying ordeal is one of several recent incidents in which hackers have figure out a way to log into Ring accounts without the user’s knowledge.

Ashley LeMay told CNN affiliate WMC she installed the camera in her daughters’ room so she could watch over them while she works overnight nursing shifts. “I did a lot of research on these before I got them. You know, I really felt like it was safe,” she told the affiliate.

The intrusion happened just four days after she installed it when she was running an errand and her husband was at home with the kids.

When her daughter Alyssa heard noises coming from her bedroom, the child went in to see what it was.

The Ring camera footage, obtained by WMC, shows Alyssa standing nervously in her room while Tiny Tim’s rendition of “Tiptoe through the Tulips,” a warbling song featured in the horror movie “Insidious,” plays over the camera’s speaker.

“Who is that,” Alyssa asks, after a man’s voice fills her room.

“I’m your best friend. I’m Santa Claus,” the voice says. “I’m Santa Claus. Don’t you want to be my best friend?”

WMC reported the unidentified person continued to harass the girl, taunting her and encouraging her to destroy her room.

“I watched the video and I mean my heart just like … I didn’t even get to the end where she is screaming ‘Mommy, mommy’ before I like ran inside,” LeMay said.

Ring responds

In a statement sent to CNN, Ring said the hacker did not gain access through a data breach or compromise of Ring’s security. Instead, the person likely took advantage of the family’s weak account security.

“Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously,” the statement said. “We have investigated this incident and can confirm it is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring’s security.”

According to the statement, Ring users “often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions.” If those were to fall into the wrong hands, those devices could be compromised.

“As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly change their passwords,” the statement said.

Ashley told WMC she had not set up two-factor authentication on her device.

Others have been hacked and harassed

There were at least three other instances in the past week alone involving Ring devices.

On Wednesday morning, a father in Nebraska was shocked to hear a voice talking to his daughter through the Ring camera on their kitchen counter. He told CNN affiliate WOWT that he immediately unplugged the device and called Ring, who told him a third-party device had logged into his account.

Earlier this week, an Atlanta woman was in her bed when a man’s voice came over her bedroom Ring camera, yelling that he could see her and demanding that she wake up, CNN affiliate WSB-TV reported.

On Sunday night in Florida, a Cape Coral couple was harassed by a person over their Ring camera who made racist comments about their biracial family, revealing that he had likely been watching them for days.

On each of these occasions, Ring said the system invasion was not the result of a breach or failure of Ring’s security. Instead, the hacker had likely gained access to the family’s account through weak or stolen login credentials.

How to avoid being a victim

Most customers, called “neighbors” by Ring, buy the cameras hoping to get the peace of mind and protection the company advertises.

Steps can be taken to protect your personal data and make it more difficult for unknown people to gain access to your accounts.

Practicing good security habits with strong and unique passwords is the first step towards strengthening your account security.

Change default password immediately and avoid using phrases or dates that are significant to you, like birthdays or relatives’ names.

Remembering multiple passwords is difficult, but password managers like 1Password or LastPass can help you keep your passwords secure but on hand for when you need to use them.

Two-factor or two-step authentication, like Ring encourages its users to set up, adds an additional layer of security on your accounts.

Two-step authentication involves a user entering a password followed by a prompt to either enter a code sent via text or email, swipe a fingerprint or provide another way to prove their identity.

50,"Oct 2, 2020",Wiley,Food Insecurity during COVID‐19,"For a decade, Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG) has provided sub‐state‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children. Along with being extensively used by food banks, it is widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. In this paper, we describe the methods underpinning MMG, detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020, and how food insecurity rates may have changed due to COVID‐19 since 2018. We project an increase of 17 million Americans who are food insecure in 2020 but this aggregate increase masks substantial geographic variation found in MMG.

Introduction This year represents the tenth anniversary of Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG). On an annual basis, MMG provides county‐ and congressional district‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children and, upon request, subcounty‐level results at, for example, the zip code level. Along with being extensively used by food banks to direct scarce resources to those most in need, it is now widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. For MMG, food insecurity rates are calculated with an imputation method that uses information from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Since the Core Food Security Module (CSFM) is in the December CPS and the resulting data is not publicly released until September of the following year and the ACS is not released until December, this has meant that MMG, released in the spring, is based on data that is roughly eighteen months old. Given that post‐Great Recession, rates have remained relatively stable from year to year, as have geographical differences within and across states, this release schedule has not produced issues regarding timeliness. Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018. In this article, after describing the methods underpinning MMG, we detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020 and how this may differ from 2018. Central to these projections is that the methods used in MMG allow for us to do this when information about predictions of the underlying variables are available. We then turn to a description of multiple aspects of this changed geography of food insecurity.

Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children). Examples of survey questions include: Did you or the other adults in your household ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?. Were you ever hungry but did not eat because you could not afford enough food? and Did a child in the household ever not eat for a full day because you could not afford enough food? (the most severe question). (For the complete set of questions, see Coleman‐Jensen et al. 2019.) The responses for some of these questions are yes or no. In other cases, respondents are asked if something happened never, sometimes, or often. A response of sometimes or often is counted as an affirmative response. Other questions ask respondents if something happened almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only one or two months. A response of almost every month or some months but not every month is counted as an affirmative response. Based on these responses, households are delineated into three categories: A household is said to be food secure if they respond affirmatively to two or fewer questions; low food secure if they respond affirmatively to three to seven questions (three to five questions for households without children); and very low food secure if they respond affirmatively to eight or more questions (six or more questions for households without children). Food insecure households are those without access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household. The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity. Methods We proceed in two steps to estimate the extent of food insecurity in each county (congressional district). Step 1 FI st = α + β UN UN st + β POV POV st + β MI MI st + β HISP HISP st + β BLACK BLACK st + β own OWN st + β DSBL DSBL st + μ t + υ s + ε st (1) where s is a state, t is year, UN is the unemployment rate, POV is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate, MI is median income, HISP is the percentage of Hispanics, BLACK is the percentage of African Americans, OWN is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners, DSBL is the percentage of individuals who report a disability, μ t is a year fixed effect, υ s is a state fixed effect, and ε st is an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Using state‐level data from 2009 to 2018, we estimate a model where the food insecurity rate for individuals at the state level is determined by the following equation:whereis a state,is year,is the unemployment rate,is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate,is median income,is the percentage of Hispanics,is the percentage of African Americans,is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners,is the percentage of individuals who report a disability,is a year fixed effect,is a state fixed effect, andis an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Our choice of variables was first guided by the literature on the determinants of food insecurity. We included variables that have been found in prior research to influence the probability of a household being food insecure. (For an overview of that literature in this context see Gundersen and Ziliak 2018.) While the food insecurity measure is defined at the household level, we assume all members of a food‐insecure household are food insecure, consistent with the approach found in, e.g., table 1 of Coleman‐Jensen et al.

The variables POV, MI, HISP, BLACK, OWN, and DISBL are based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures and UN is based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. We use the coefficient estimates from Step 1 plus information on the same variables defined at the county level to generate estimated food‐insecurity rates for individuals defined at the county level. This can be expressed in the following equation:wheredenotes a county. The variables, andare based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures andis based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. This year for MMG we made two primary changes. First, we added the percent of the population that has a disability to reflect the profound impact that disability status has on food insecurity. (See, e.g., Balistreri 2019; Brucker and Coleman‐Jensen 2017; Noonan, Corman, and Reichman 2016; Sonik et al. 2016.) Second, the poverty variable now only includes nonundergraduate students. This is because the true resources available to undergraduates are, on average, not reflected in the poverty rate. Consistent with this are the much lower food insecurity rates among college students in comparison to noncollege students of similar ages (Gundersen 2021). The above methods allow us to establish a base measure of food insecurity for all counties for the full population and for children. Using this base measure, we establish what we believe will happen to food insecurity in the US in 2020 because of the COVID‐19 pandemic. To do so, we consider what will occur if two of the variables in the model above, the unemployment rate and the poverty rate, increase along the lines predicted by expert opinions. (The other variables in our model are unlikely to change due to COVID‐19.) In our most recent estimates of the upper‐bound impact (as of July 13, 2020), we have assumed that the annual average unemployment rate will increase to 11.5% (up 7.6% compared to 2018) and the poverty rate will increase to 16.6% (up 4.8% compared to 2018). When we wrote the first version of this paper, there had not been expert projections of changes in poverty rates due to COVID‐19, so we assumed that the proportional change in the poverty rate viz. the unemployment rate would be roughly the same as during the Great Recession. To put this into terms of equation (2), we assume the value of UN C will increase (on average) by 0.076 and the value of POV c will increase by 0.048. This increase in the unemployment rate, though, is unlikely to be uniform across all counties in the US Instead, certain industries and occupations will be disproportionately affected by COVID‐19. So, we further adjust the county‐level and CD‐level unemployment projections for the proportion of the population that is likely to lose their jobs, combining data from the American Community Survey with estimates established in Hatzius et al. (2020).

Findings At the national level, we project 54 million food insecure Americans in 2020, approximately 17 million higher than in 2018. For children, the food insecurity rates are projected to increase to 18 million, up nearly 7 million from 2018. These national estimates, though, mask substantial heterogeneity across the country in terms of the projected impacts of COVID‐19. This is not unexpected, given the geographic diversity in the base models for both the full population (figure 1) and children (figure 2). Looking at states, the highest five states are the same whether or not COVID‐19 occurred—Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. However, there are some states that will see much higher food insecurity rates. Nevada stands out—pre‐COVID‐19 it would have been twentieth, but post‐COVID‐19 it is projected to be eighth. For children, Louisiana and New Mexico are first and second with or without COVID‐19, but Nevada is now third (ninth without COVID‐19). The substantially higher projected rates for Nevada are primarily due to their reliance on service sector jobs, which have been disproportionately affected by COVID‐19.

[Color figure can be viewed at [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com One of the key contributions from MMG is its portrayal of the substantial heterogeneity in local food insecurity that is seen in figures 1 and 2. The responses to COVID‐19 will also vary based on geography, although, consistent with the state results, there is likely to be some similarities in terms of county rankings. For the full population (table 1), we display, first, the fifteen counties with the highest rates of food insecurity in the base case and due to our projections. In the base case, the fifteen counties are all in the South or counties with Indian Reservations. The highest is Jefferson County, Mississippi (30.4%) and the fifteenth is Harlan County, Kentucky (24.8%). Without the adjustments for county‐level differences in unemployment rates described above, these would be the same orderings after COVID‐19 but, due to these adjustments, there are some differences. The five highest remain the same but, for example, Washington County, Mississippi and Wolfe County, Kentucky are now in the top fifteen. In the final two column of table 1 we display the projected percent increases in food insecurity for the highest fifteen counties. These are all counties with base rates that are relatively low, which is the reason for the substantial increases. The increases range from 157.3% in the highest (Burke County, North Dakota) to 109.5% in the fifteenth highest (Daggett County, Utah). These dramatic increases may be one reason for why some food banks reported being especially strained in response to COVID‐19. Table 2 has the same structure as table 1 but for children. As expected, there is overlap in counties between the two. For example, Kusilvak Census Area in Alaska is second highest for children and fourth highest for the full population for both the base case and the rankings after COVID‐19. There are some contrasts, though, insofar as Texas has no counties in the top fifteen for the full population but has four in the base case for children and four in the COVID‐19 projections. In terms of projected percent increases for children, there are some differences with the full population. While North Dakota has ten of the fifteen highest counties for the full population, they have two for children and, conversely, Virginia has one in the full population but six for children including the top three. The range of the percent increase is also higher and wider—from 143.6% for the fifteenth (Kendall County, Illinois) to 363.0% to the highest (Falls Church City, Virginia).

Conclusion The proceeding discussion—and the full set of results with updates as needed at http://map.feedingamerica.org/—provides an overview of the geographic diversity in food insecurity rates across the U.S. and what may happen due to COVID‐19. We conclude with three main points. First, while these projections of increased food insecurity rates are of great concern, they would have been for worse were it not for the resiliency of the agricultural supply chain in the face of COVID‐19. (For more on this, see the other articles in this Special Issue.) Given that food prices are a key determinant of food insecurity (e.g., Gregory and Coleman‐Jensen 2013; Courtemanche et al. 2019), if there had been price increases due to agricultural supply chain breakdowns, the food insecurity rates we have estimated would have been much higher. In other words, the projected increase in food insecurity is due to projected increases in unemployment and poverty and not problems within the agricultural sector. Future researchers may wish to consider why this success occurred and, in particular, the protections it afforded vulnerable persons. Second, our estimates are based on information from annual food insecurity measures for the full calendar year instead of food insecurity measures that are based on either shorter time frames (e.g., the previous thirty days) and or across years. In addition, these estimates are based on the full set of eighteen questions on the CFSM. Three other papers in this Special Issue employ other methods to ascertain the impact of COVID‐19 on food insecurity and, as such, our results are not directly comparable. (See Ahn and Norwood 2021; Restrepo, Rabbitt, and Gregory 2021: and Ziliak 2021.) Third, the accuracy of our projections will not become evident until September 2021 for the national results and March 2022 for the MMG estimates. We look forward to ascertaining the success (or lack of success) of our projections at that time.

Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018.
Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children).
The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity.

51,"Jan 11, 2021",The Conversation US,18 million US children are at risk of hunger: How is the problem being addressed and what more can be done?,"Editor’s note: The economic crisis brought about by the coronavirus pandemic has increased the number of Americans who can’t always get enough to eat, including children. The Conversation U.S. asked four experts to explain how common child hunger is and what’s being done to address it.

1. How big a problem is child hunger in the US?

Heather Eicher-Miller, associate professor of nutrition science at Purdue University: Hunger has two very different meanings. It can describe that uncomfortable feeling you get after not eating in a while. It’s also a long-term physical state.

People who experience long-term hunger aren’t just uncomfortable. They can feel weakness or pain and run an elevated risk of illnesses, including asthma, iron-deficiency anemia and poor bone health.

Hunger can of course arise when someone doesn’t eat enough, but it’s also a result of food insecurity – what happens when you lack the money or other means of accessing enough of the right kinds or amounts of food.

Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

David Himmelgreen, professor of anthropology at the University of South Florida: Food insecurity and child hunger have both skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were an estimated 50 million food-insecure Americans by the end of 2020, up sharply from 35 million in 2019, the last year for which official data is available.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, estimated in 2019 that there were 12.5 million U.S. children – 1 in 6 – at risk of hunger. With growth in the number of American workers unemployed and children living in poverty, a team of researchers determined in July 2020 that 18 million children – 1 in 4 – were experiencing food insecurity at least sometimes, a few months into the coronavirus pandemic.

Kecia Johnson, assistant professor of sociology at Mississippi State University: Children who experience hunger are more likely to be sick, to recuperate from illness more slowly and to be hospitalized more frequently.

Among other things, being food insecure increases the potential for obesity, heart disease and diabetes, including for children. And food-insecure children are at least twice as likely as other kids to have a variety of health problems, such as anemia, asthma and anxiety.

Food-insecure kids can also have more trouble at school than other children and become more likely to experience social isolation.

2. What’s being done about the problem?

Diana Cuy Castellanos, assistant professor of dietetics and nutrition at the University of Dayton: Some 15 federal programs assist Americans who need help getting enough nutritious food to eat. The programs cover different populations including the elderly, people with low incomes, infants and children, and Native American communities, as well as areas where there is need for emergency relief due to disasters.

The largest is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known more commonly as SNAP. It provides assistance for the purchase of food based on income and cost US$85.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Following the passage of a bipartisan relief package in December, most families of four can currently get $782 in monthly assistance through SNAP.

Many people still call these benefits “food stamps,” but now, instead of receiving vouchers to purchase food, people receive a card that looks like a credit card with their food allowance on it.

The government also runs the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides nutritional aid for low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women and women with at least one child age 5 or under. In addition, there are the School Breakfast and Lunch programs as well as the Summer Food Service Program, which funds free healthy meals and snacks to children and teens in low-income areas when school is not in session.

Many of these programs target specific segments of the population, such as children and the elderly. All have something in common: They are designed to help low-income families afford food so as to free up more of their limited income on other needs, such as housing and transportation.

Himmelgreen: While federal nutrition programs have helped reduce the severity of food insecurity and child hunger, only a limited number of Americans who don’t get enough to eat can take advantage of them. To get SNAP in Florida, for example, people may not have more than a total of either $2,001 or $3,001 – depending on their age and disabilities – in their savings and checking accounts. Other states have similar but different restrictions, making it hard to estimate the number of Americans who need help but can’t get it. Hence, millions more people than ever are relying on drive-through food pantries during the pandemic.

Johnson: There are some 60,000 food pantries, meal programs and food banks, according to Feeding America, serving about 40 million people yearly. Feeding America and its affiliated food banks and pantries also run food pantries in schools and backpack programs, which provide students with easily prepared foods, like boxed macaroni and cheese and canned beans, to take home, throughout the country.

For example, an elementary school in Holmes County, Mississippi, has supplied participating families with food and other supplies since 2019.

Eicher-Miller: Nutrition education is another way to address food insecurity and help reduce the number of children who go hungry. For example, the federal government offers nutrition education to individuals and families who receive SNAP benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education program, or SNAP-Ed. It provides comprehensive nutrition education regarding how to get the most nutrition per food dollar to many of the people who get SNAP benefits and may be having trouble serving their families healthy meals on a limited budget.

The government supports SNAP-Ed in locations like food pantries, community centers and food assistance offices. Its practical budgeting advice, cooking classes and nutrition information make families with children less likely to experience food insecurity, according to a study by my team. When people get the hang of buying the healthiest foods they can on a tight budget, their kids are less likely to go hungry.

I think of nutrition education as a gift that keeps giving in the sense that once someone has the knowledge they can keep using it to stay food secure into the future.

3. What are some of the more promising innovations?

Cuy Castellanos: Food insecurity is a complex problem for many reasons, including the limited access millions of people have to the fresh fruits and vegetables everyone should eat.

That’s why I’m excited to see people starting to grow their own food in low-income communities with few grocery stores or opportunities to buy produce, from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Nonprofits and families are growing food on their own property or are using vacant lots or land on school or church grounds.

Some groups such as Homefull and Mission of Mary Farms in Dayton, Ohio, have even begun to build greenhouses to extend the growing season and producing root vegetables and leafy greens as well as raising chickens.

Johnson: A new community garden is also making a difference in the small majority-Black town of Maben in rural Mississippi, where there’s nowhere to buy vegetables. Starting in 2019, local leaders approved the conversion of a former school athletic field into a community garden. Once volunteers from a farmers cooperative had cleared and plowed the field, other volunteers planted and harvested crops of tomatoes, purple hull peas, okra and watermelons. The gardeners distributed this first wave of produce primarily to elderly people in Maben who used to have family gardens and give away their own homegrown food in years past.

Himmelgreen: Many innovative programs across the country are aiming to reduce food insecurity and improve the health of low-income Americans.

At “client food choice” food pantries, clients don’t just pick up boxes of free, nutritious items. Instead, they get to choose the foods they want and get recipes and other kinds of nutrition education. There are also food prescription programs based in hospitals and medical clinics, where patients are screened for food insecurity and, if eligible, enrolled in SNAP and given help connecting with food pantries either on site or nearby.

A growing number of nonprofits also refer people to school-based food pantries, which operate in K-12 public schools and on college campuses and the meals-on-wheels programs that assist people who are homebound.

I believe these programs need to be scaled up or replicated whenever possible in areas where there is a high level of food insecurity and child hunger but a lack of nonprofit help available.","Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

Just after 2 a.m., Vicksburg police officers responded to a call where two women were causing a disturbance over the temperature of their food. The women were told to leave and then escorted out of the restaurant by a security guard.

Once outside, the women reportedly attempted to assault the security guard and sprayed him with pepper spray. It was also at this time that an unknown male shot three times in the direction of the security guard.

The security guard was not hit and returned fire, shooting in the direction of the unknown male twice.

No one was injured and no arrests have been made. A 2012 Toyota Camry parked in front of the restaurant was struck three times.

The restaurant was shut down temporarily. According to city officials, Chief Milton Moore did a walk-through of the restaurant and gave additional security recommendations. The restaurant was allowed to reopen, but restaurant officials are expected to meet with city leaders Monday to discuss needed security improvements.","An argument over cold food heated things leading to a shootout at a Mississippi Waffle House early Saturday morning.

(CNN) —

US immigration authorities have detained some 680 undocumented immigrants in what a federal prosecutor described as a record-setting operation.

US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Mike Hurst told reporters the arrests took place at seven sites in six different cities in Mississippi on Wednesday. The raids, he said, are “believed to be the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in our nation’s history.”

Officials declined to provide details about what sites had been targeted, citing what they said was an ongoing criminal investigation. CNN affiliates reported the raids at food-processing plants throughout the state.

The arrests came as a result of administrative and criminal search warrants executed by special agents from Homeland Security Investigations, Hurst said.

“Today, through the hard work of these men and women, we are once again becoming a nation of laws,” he said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has stepped up worksite enforcement since President Donald Trump took office, conducting a number of large-scale raids at food-processing plants and gardening centers in recent years.

“These are not new laws, nor is the enforcement of them new,” acting ICE director Matt Albence said Wednesday.

“The arrests today were the result of a year-long criminal investigation. And the arrests and warrants that were executed today are just another step in that investigation.”

Video shows girl begging to see her mom

A tense scene unfolded outside a plant in Morton, Mississippi, as friends and family members clamored for information and buses rumbled by to pick up large groups of detained immigrants and take them away.

A Facebook video broadcast live at the scene showed an 11-year-old girl sobbing and begging an officer for a chance to see her mother as bystanders tried to comfort her.

Elizabeth Iraheta told CNN she shared the video so people would see what was happening at the chicken plant where she said she’s worked legally for 19 years. It was devastating, Iraheta said, to see family and friends suffering “just for coming to work hard in this country, and to see so many families separated.”

Iraheta’s video shows an officer noting that the mother is being processed “because she doesn’t have papers to be here legally,” then later telling the crying girl that her mother would be released and wouldn’t be deported. Eventually, Iraheta said, the girl’s mother was able to see her before she was taken away.

But Iraheta said she isn’t sure what will happen to the girl’s mother, how many people were detained at the plant where she works or what will happen to them now.

“Today was the first day of school. All the parents went to take their kids to school,” Iraheta said. “Now their kids maybe are alone. “

Albence, the acting ICE director, told reporters Wednesday that in the past the agency has worked with school liaisons to help “find placement” for children when their parents are detained.

“Most of the time, they’re placed with another family member,” he said, adding that each case would be evaluated and handled individually.

“Some of the parents that were arrested will be released and placed on an ankle monitor throughout (their immigration) proceedings,” he said.

Mayor: ‘What happens to the children?’

Several local officials criticized the operation.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called the raids “dehumanizing and ineffective,” issuing a statement calling for local houses of worship “to become sanctuaries for our immigrant neighbors and protect them from potential harm.”

William Truly Jr., the mayor of Canton, Mississippi, told reporters outside a processing plant owned by Peco Foods Inc. that he was concerned about the impact the arrests would have on the local economy.

“I recognize that ICE comes under the Department of Homeland Security, and this is an order of the United States. There’s nothing I don’t think anybody can do about it,” he said. “But my main concern is now, what happens to the children?”

Fears are running high in immigrant communities

Wednesday’s arrests come as anxiety is running high in many immigrant communities days after a gunman who apparently espoused anti-immigrant views killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.

Hurst acknowledged the recent tragedy in response to a reporter’s question Wednesday, but said the operation’s timing came as a result of careful planning in a lengthy investigation.

“This operation began over a year ago. You don’t bring over 650 special agents from across the country into the Southern District of Mississippi in a matter of three days without preparation for months and months and months,” he said. “So while the tragedies this weekend around the country are horrific, this operation had been planned way before that, and we intended to carry it out.”

In a statement provided to CNN affiliate WAPT, a company that owns several facilities where arrests occurred Wednesday said it is cooperating with investigators.

“We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and are navigating a potential disruption of operations,” Peco Foods Inc. said in a statement. “We adhere strongly to all local, state and federal laws including utilizing the government-based E-Verify program which screens new hires through the Social Security Administration as well as the Department of Homeland Security for compliance.”

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s Center for Population Studies has partnered with two regional community organizations to launch the 2020 Hunger Summit, which provides a venue for community organizations and their partners to share information and support during the pandemic.

Partners in the effort are the Delta Directions Consortium and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. Starting in September, the Hunger Summit has convened the first Thursday of each month via Zoom.

“The Hunger Summit has been a great success,” said Terrence Hunter, fellow of the Delta Directions Consortium and alumnus of the Ole Miss School of Law who has moderated each of the sessions. “It is amazing seeing so many food pantries and food banks come together with a unified mission: combating food insecurity in the Mississippi Delta in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The concept for the Hunger Summit stems from a previous collaboration between the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Center for Population Studies. The first Desoto County Hunger Summit was held in Hernando in 2017.

This year’s summit was born out of a broader initiative between foundations and university entities to find out how food pantries and nonprofits were operating in the midst of the pandemic. The Maddox Foundation, Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi, partners within the Delta Directions Consortium and the UM Community First Research Center for Wellbeing and Creative Achievement joined forces to conduct social science, public health and legal research that would help pantries and other organizations providing food assistance to Mississippi families.

Before the pandemic, the Center for Population Studies, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi were already collaborating to identify challenges and opportunities in several north Mississippi communities, with the goal of building capacity and promoting community health and well-being.

With the onset of the pandemic, the focus narrowed to the critical and time-sensitive issues of addressing food insecurity and hunger in these communities.

“What began as a project for the future really turned out to be extremely impactful in the present,” said Robin Hurdle, president and CEO of the Maddox Foundation. “As schools and businesses closed, emergency resources and critical funding were desperately needed, and the homework done by so many for our original proposal laid the groundwork necessary to make the FEED Fund possible.”

The FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund was established at the Community Foundation to enable pantries and nonprofits to become self-sustaining.

Through the fund, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi have worked to raise and distribute money to allow food pantries and other organizations to serve more Mississippians in need and invest in their future. The fund has granted nearly $800,000 to nonprofits that are working to meet the academic, educational and nutritional needs of children.

With the Hunger Summit, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Delta Directions Consortium have been able to bring donors and nonprofits together to find innovative ways to meet the needs that Mississippians are experiencing as a result of the pandemic.

“The Hunger Summit has brought synergy to the foundation’s efforts to address the food insecurity needs in our region,” said Keith Fulcher, president of the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. “Partnerships have been formed with state, national and even international organizations whose mission is to feed the hungry. We could not have made these connections without the leadership of Delta Directions.”

The Community Foundation serves 11 counties in northwest Mississippi, assisting and connecting donors and nonprofit organizations and charitable causes.

The Delta Directions Consortium is an alliance of individuals, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and foundations committed to creating positive social change in the Mississippi Delta region. John Green, senior research associate at the Center for Population Studies, serves as a coordinator for this multi-institutional consortium.

Each 2020 Hunger Summit meeting presents relevant information or data to community partners, while providing a space for them to share challenges and successes. Participants have learned about the CARES Act reimbursement grant for food pantries and nonprofits, the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program, and federal and state food donation policies.

Hunger Summit and FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund research has included both the Center for Population Studies and the Harvard Law School’s Food Law and Policy Clinic – also a Delta Directions partner – with faculty, staff and students involved in presentations.

The final meeting of the 2020 Hunger Summit is set for 12:30 p.m. Thursday (Dec. 3). The summit is open to all who have an interest in best practices for meeting food assistance needs during these challenging times.

55,"May 31, 2020",The Guardian,'People are going to go hungry': pandemic effects could leave 54m Americans without food,"A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.

Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures.

As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year – a 63% increase compared to 2018.

Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

America’s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities.

It’s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020.

The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% – 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 – and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% – 4.8 points higher than 2018.

In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children.

Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen.

“We were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don’t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.

Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. “People are going to go hungry, that’s the truth,” said Scott.

The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year – a rise of almost 60% since 2018.

Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February.

“This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

On Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, 1,400 or so cars lined up at a mobile distribution point, which was open for three hours, for grocery boxes of canned fruits, pinto beans, pasta, milk, fresh vegetables, frozen meat and bread, to help make ends meet for a month.

Historically, there was a shortfall of 34m meals every year in the five counties served by the Community Food Bank of southern Arizona. Currently, the demand remains sky high – double pre-pandemic levels, and statewide 17% of the workforce have claimed unemployment since the start of the crisis.

“We were getting darn close to closing the meal gap before the crisis,” said Michael McDonald, the CEO. “But if demand continues at this rate for the rest of the year or into next year, we’re going to fall way short. I don’t see us being able to keep up without a longer-term commitment from the federal government.”

One in three children in Arizona could go hungry this year without food aid.

Food banks aren’t in it alone.

Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product.

In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)’s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries.

But it’s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights.

“Everything feels so unpredictable, I’ve literally no idea what’s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,” said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.

In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 – a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit. Only a tiny fraction of the USDA contracts went to distributors in New England.

As states start to reopen for business, economic recovery is expected to be painfully slow especially if further outbreaks are not adequately contained, which could trigger a full-blown second wave of the pandemic. Underemployment could last for years, which means millions of Americans are likely to need help with food, utilities and rent in the medium and long term.

Los Angeles county, where almost half the state of California’s Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, is projected to have 1.68 million food insecure people this year – the highest number in the country. It’s the most populous county in the US, with 10 million residents, where unemployment has risen to 20.3% – five percentage points higher than the state average – and food stamp applications have almost tripled compared with last year.

“If the numbers stay like this, no way food banks can cope, it’s beyond our capabilities, a lot will depend on how long federal help lasts,” said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Food Bank, which has distributed 80% more groceries since the pandemic began.

Susan King, president of Feeding Northeast Florida, agrees: “It’s when the dust settles that I’m most worried about, when the federal and state help is over but the line of people waiting for food is still long.”

King added: “This is a marathon, we can’t sugarcoat how scary it is; it absolutely keeps me up at night.”","Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

Over 1.2 million in the state are eligible and now receiving federal SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits which are administered by the state. The COVID-19 virus outbreak and resulting closing orders and restrictions on Michigan residents have left hundreds of thousands without jobs and struggling to keep afloat.

Last August, Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer decided some experts were needed to work to try and manage the worsening situation. She announced the formation of a Food Security Council. Its job is to review ongoing food assistance efforts and decide what else needs to be done.

The council issued a preliminary report last October. Now the panel is presenting new recommendations to the Governor. They involve three primary areas of concern. The first is the overall food needs of Michigan residents. The second is a collaboration between state government agencies and other public and private groups to maintain and improve supply chain issues. The third deals with fine-tuning existing food availability issues and even addressing things like panic buying.

Governor Whitmer says, “I formed the Food Security Council to make sure that all Michiganders – no matter their socioeconomic status – can put food on the table for themselves and their families. The needs are especially recognizable and critical during a pandemic but must continue to be addressed when the current crisis is over. I applaud members of the council for their hard work, creativity, and partnership during a very challenging time for our state and country.”","The job of making sure Michigan residents have enough food to eat is becoming a monumental task.

Nine years into the economic recovery, roughly one in eight U.S. households still struggle to get enough food to eat, at least occasionally, but the longer-term trend has been marked by gradual improvement.

Some 11.8 percent of American households — and slightly more in Arizona — were deemed ""food insecure,"" according to a report released Sept. 5 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

That definition means one or more members of these households faced some period during 2017 when their food intake was reduced and eating patterns disrupted, usually because of a lack of money.

Slightly more Arizonan households, 13.1 percent, were food insecure, placing the state in 18th place in this dubious measure. States were evaluated over a different three-year span, covering 2015 to 2017.

Neighboring New Mexico had the nation's highest rate of household food insecurity at 17.9 percent, followed by four Southern states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Hawaii had the lowest rate, 7.4 percent of households, slightly better than New Jersey and North Dakota.

Arizona improved from 12th place, and a 14.9 percent rate of food insecurity, in an earlier study covering 2013-15.

Occasional struggles

Authors of the report noted that most Americans don't face hunger throughout the year.

""When households experience very low food security in the United States, the resulting instances of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns are usually occasional or episodic, but not usually chronic,"" they said.

Nevertheless, Melissa Boteach, a senior vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, cited the report as evidence that ""far too many Americans, especially households with children, are struggling to put food on the table.""

In a statement, she attacked President Donald Trump for downplaying poverty and urged the White House to adopt policies such as a higher national minimum wage.

The latest 11.8 percent food-insecurity level marked an improvement from 12.3 percent in 2016. After peaking at 14.9 percent in 2011, in the wake of the recession, the rate has declined for six straight years. It hasn't dropped below 10 percent for the past two decades. It stood at 11.1 percent at the outset of the recession in 2007.

Jerry Brown, a spokesman for St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix, agreed that food insecurity has alleviated somewhat in Arizona recently, allowing his group to serve high-risk groups that the organization wasn't able to connect with earlier.

""We have been able to expand because we haven't been in an all-hands-on-deck situation, manning the lines to get food to people in need,"" he said.

Examples of St. Mary's expanded outreach include sending mobile-pantry trucks into high-need neighborhoods in the town of Guadalupe and the Maryvale community in west Phoenix and delivering food to public school systems on tribal reservations in northern Arizona.

High-risk groups

The latest study incorporated survey responses from more than 37,000 households, with help from the Census Bureau.

Nationally, 30.8 percent of people living below the poverty level dealt with food insecurity last year. Other groups with high rates included African-Americans (21.8 percent), Hispanics (18 percent) and households with children (15.7 percent), including those headed by a single woman (30.3 percent) or single man (19.7 percent).

Arizona has an above-average rate of food insecurity involving children, Brown said, citing information from another study. ""We still have about 400,000 kids facing food insecurity (in Arizona), but we're getting better,"" he said.

About three in five food-insecure households took advantage of one or more of the three main federal food assistance programs — SNAP or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps), the National School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

58,"May 16, 2019",The Hill,Criminal justice includes food security — we can't ban the social safety net,"Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has signed criminal justice reform legislation that will ease reentry for people returning home from prison. Among the most notable elements of the new law is an opt out of a 23-year-old federal ban on food stamps and financial assistance for people with felony drug convictions. The change will help protect the many people who confront hunger and poverty upon their release from prison.

Mississippi is the latest state to amend or rescind this cruel federal policy, which emerged when the political consensus of the 1990s supported punitive and racially charged approaches to both drugs and poverty.

The changes followed years of congressional actions to establish harsh mandatory minimums for federal drug offenses and incentivize states to follow its lead in enacting long sentences. Unfair perceptions about people who use drugs, particularly crack cocaine, powered the debate.

While the law permits states to opt out of the ban, and ones as diverse as Arkansas, California, Maine and Wyoming have already done so, 30 states still maintain either a lifetime or modified ban on SNAP, TANF or both.

According to the National Institute of Health, 91 percent of people transitioning from incarceration report experiencing food insecurity. Moreover, employment opportunities for returning residents are limited because of outdated or inadequate skills, medical and mental health challenges and employer bias. A Harvard University study conducted by Bruce Western of 120 people in Boston found an initial average annual income of just $6,500 after incarceration.

The impoverished status of people leaving incarceration also exacerbates the financial conditions of the poor families to whom they return. By definition, families share with one another; more people in a household without more resources translates to less food for everyone in the family, including children.

States that have rejected the tough on crime approach to welfare reform have improved public safety outcomes. One study found that recidivism rates declined up to 10 percent one year after release when cash assistance and food stamps were immediately available to people returning home.

These reforms are foundational to successful reintegration.

Fortunately, Congress may be showing it has learned from the mistakes of its past. Last year, the U.S. Senate successfully held off an amendment incorporated into the House of Representatives’ bill to reauthorize SNAP that would have extended the lifetime food stamp ban to people convicted of violent offenses. The amendment, which would have permanently excluded people from accessing food assistance regardless of the date of their offense, was widely opposed by civil rights and anti-hunger organizations as well as conservative groups known for their embrace of criminal justice reform. Its defeat is a hopeful sign.

In Mississippi, an estimated 67,000 people — disproportionately women — will gain access to food stamps because of the state’s decision to lift the federal ban. While championing the new law, Republican state Sen. Sally Dotson said, “the overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities."" Evidence suggests that in this respect, Mississippi is on the right track.

59,"Jan 19, 2021",Education Week,Where Families Are Feeling Pandemic Impacts the Worst,"The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare some of the educational and resource inequities facing families across the country in a host of areas, from access to technology and time for home-based learning to the literal bread-and-butter issues of household finances and food for the table.

The EdWeek Research Center’s analysis of recent U.S. Census Bureau survey data on families with children paints a picture of regional winners and losers, areas of progress even during the pandemic, and places where deficits remain entrenched amid the continued disruption of school and family life.

Among the key takeaways from the Census surveys conducted Oct. 28 through Nov. 9 of last year:

COVID-19 continues to squeeze many households with children enrolled in school. Nationally, 17 percent of such families said they lost employment income due to pandemic-related reasons during the survey period. But the impact is uneven: 19 percent of families in the Northeast and the South documented job loss or the inability to find a job, compared with 12 percent in the Midwest.

Families in every state began experiencing hunger during the pandemic. Nationwide, 16 percent of families who said they had enough to eat before the pandemic now say their children sometimes or often have to go without food.

Technology access remains uneven. Seventy-nine percent of households with children said they always had access to computer devices as of November, up from 71 percent in April. That same improvement wasn’t true for access to the home internet service crucial for remote instruction. That remained stagnant at around 75 percent.

States and regions vary widely in how much they think the pandemic has disrupted normal schooling. Nationally, 27 percent of households with students said that their current learning time was “much less than [in] a school day before the coronavirus pandemic.” But the numbers vary widely by state—from 42 percent in Nevada and Oregon to just 15 percent each in Florida and South Dakota, where schools were less likely to have adopted remote learning in response to the pandemic.

A closer look at the data illustrates how the pandemic’s effect on factors affecting readiness to learn—much like the disease itself—varies in location and in intensity.

Food insecurity is a regional issue

That disparity is especially true in an area that hits close to home: food insecurity. For example, the proportion of families reporting that they no longer have enough to eat is the highest in Mississippi, at 38 percent, and the lowest in Maine and South Dakota, each at 5 percent.

Regionally, the data show that pandemic-induced hunger issues are most severe in the West at 19 percent, and in the South at 18 percent. Overall, the Northeast appears to be struggling the least on this front at 12 percent, in contrast to having the largest earning loss relative to other regions. Additionally, only 14 percent of Midwestern households documented having issues with food security.

“Communities that had the highest levels of food insecurity prior to the pandemic have also been hit the hardest,” said Emily Engelhard, the managing director of research at Feeding America, an umbrella organization for food banks across the country. “Like Mississippi, these states in the South have higher levels of poverty, higher levels of unemployment. Across a number of those different socioeconomic indicators, you are seeing that people are worse off, and so food insecurity is going to fall into those social determinants of health.”

Engelhard describes a rise in demand, a drop in the number of volunteers, and supply chain problems all putting pressure on the charitable systems assisting those without food.

She and her team are currently piloting various programs, including giving clients the ability to preorder groceries from food banks. She is interested in seeing what works and what can be continued, if not expanded, after the pandemic.

On the related issue of income loss for families as a result of the pandemic, reasons cited in the survey data included falling ill with the virus, caring for sick loved ones, and children whose schools or day cares closed.

There’s uneven access to computers and Wi-Fi

With so many children learning from home, access to technology has become more important than ever.

“Schools have done a pretty good job at handing out devices in part because they had a lot of devices that were sitting on laptop carts,” said Evan Marwell, the founder of EducationSuperHighway, a nonprofit that works to alleviate internet access disparities. “Internet connectivity is a totally different animal.”

Marwell said school districts during the pandemic have mostly tried to do deals with carriers for mobile hotspots. He believes the better approach is working with cable companies to get families broadband directly. Marwell notes how hotspots often have coverage issues; often, the quality of the signal being available, especially in low-income neighborhoods, is weak and makes it difficult to do things like complete homework assignments.

Access to technology also is regionally inconsistent. Even though computers’ availability for educational purposes has improved across all regions, the South is still behind at 75 percent compared to the Northeast, at 83 percent, or the West, at 82 percent.

Wi-Fi access, meanwhile, has improved in the Northeast, going from 78 percent to 83 percent, and in the Midwest, increasing from 72 percent to 77 percent since April. But it has remained mostly stagnant in the South, decreasing to 71 percent from 72 percent. And the West Coast dropped in terms of internet access, from 77 percent in the spring to 75 percent in the more recent survey period.

“The more rural the state is, the worse off they’re going to be,” said Marwell, noting that there’s been little new infrastructure building during the pandemic in places that didn’t already have it. “And so when you talk about the Southern states and places like Mississippi, like there’s huge rural populations there.”

Surveys give a snapshot of lost learning time

It’s no surprise that the pandemic has affected the number of hours students spend on their education, and the Census data bear that out.

The Census asked specifically how much time students typically had spent on learning activities over the past seven days compared to the length of their school days before the coronavirus pandemic.

The South, at 24 percent, and Midwest, at 28 percent, were less likely to report having lost hours than the Northeast at 31 percent and the West at 30 percent.

In states at the lowest end of the spectrum for lost instructional time—including South Dakota, Florida, Nebraska, and Wyoming—households were the most likely to say that their children had not experienced remote learning, canceled classes, or any other changes resulting from the pandemic.

Nationally, most families with K-12 students in 44 states and the District of Columbia say classes normally taught in person had moved to some form of distance learning due to the pandemic during the 2020-21 school year.

The percentage of households experiencing the shift ranged from more than 90 percent in Oregon and the District of Columbia to less than 40 percent in Nebraska and South Dakota.

Students in the West at 82 percent were more likely to shift to distance learning than their counterparts in the Midwest at 64 percent. Those living in the South and Northeast changed to remote learning 69 percent and 70 percent, respectively. Only 1 percent of households in California and Oregon noted zero changes to their children’s education.

One in 10 households say their children’s education did not change due to the pandemic because their schools did not close for in-person instruction. That ranged from just 4 percent of households on the West Coast to 15 percent in the South and Midwest.

The crisis makes things worse for the most-vulnerable

Despite the many regional and state variations, the Census data confirm that households with school-age children in all states continue to suffer significant challenges to the resources and conditions needed to support students in the pandemic-disrupted learning environment.

But the data also pinpoint ironies in states’ individual experiences and show how the coronavirus amplifies issues for the most-vulnerable of populations.

South Dakotan families, for example, say that their children’s education hasn’t changed as much as in other states. However, South Dakota, alongside North Dakota, has had some of the virus’s highest case rates for COVID-19 since January 2020. According to developmental psychologists, this kind of stress alone influences the socioemotional development and executive functioning skills of children.

And Mississippi has always scored near the bottom with a C- grade on the Quality Counts the Chance-for-Success Index. This year, for example, it finishes 46th in the national index, which captures a wide range of socioeconomic indicators. The pandemic has only added to those deficits. Case in point: According to the recent Census data, 2 out of 5 households in Mississippi no longer have the same degree of certainty that they can feed their children.

Beginning in May, Brenda Ann Kenneally set out across the country, from New York to California, to capture the routines of Americans who struggle to feed their families, piecing together various forms of food assistance, community support and ingenuity to make it from one month to the next.

Food insecurity is as much about the threat of deprivation as it is about deprivation itself: A food-insecure life means a life lived in fear of hunger, and the psychological toll that takes. Like many hardships, this burden falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic families, who are almost twice as likely to experience food insecurity as white families.

Like so many who live at hunger’s edge, the members of the extended Stocklas family — whom Kenneally has photographed for years — gain and lose food stamps depending on fluctuating employment status in an unstable economy. They often have trouble stretching their funds to the end of the month, so they pool resources to provide family-style dinners for all. Tap to cycle through images When Kandice Zakrzewski, 25, was no longer eligible for food stamps, she stopped buying Lactaid for her son, Matthew Ratleph, 2. “We had to give that up for him. And just say ‘You can’t drink milk.’ Or we have to water it down.” Just days before Kenneally arrived, the governor closed schools statewide, creating a new source of stress for food-insecure families, which often rely on free school lunches to keep their school-age children fed. This made the family’s big collective meals all the more crucial. “Even if it’s just pitching in $10 when we don’t have food stamps,” Kandice Zakrzewski says, “we all pitch in.” Zakrzewski’s son Brayden Ratleph, 6. Kayla Stocklas. “We just kind of get our food and just all do our own thing,"" Zakrzewski says.

Late last year, Doris Hall, 63, moved back to Gary, her hometown, to look after her great-grandchildren — “so they don’t have to be in daycare,” she says. On weekends, she takes in as many as nine of the children — occasionally all 14 — so that their parents can work. Tap to cycle through images Hall’s rules are strict: naptime in the afternoon, bedtime at 9 p.m. and most important, whatever she cooks, they must eat. For lunch, it’s “microwaveable stuff,” like corndogs, hot dogs and chicken nuggets that Hall picks up at the nearby food bank. Dinners vary: spaghetti, chicken, soups, tacos. When she has a rare moment to eat alone, she makes her favorite meal for herself: greens and tacos. Some of Hall’s great-grandchildren waiting for lunch. Armani and Kimani Lacy, 5. “I never liked cooking,” Hall says, “but now that I’ve been taking care of the grandkids, I stay in the kitchen.”

In the face of deprivation, food-insecure families often seize any opportunity to get and store food when it’s available. In the middle of a food desert in Jackson, Miss., a family’s freezer holds as much as it can. Freezing milk in Erie, Pa., so nothing goes to waste. In Tucson, Ariz., a “cheap soup” made on the stovetop. In Gary, Ind., assembling a full meal from individual school-lunch portions of taco meat. Stockpiling supplies in Jackson, Miss. School lunches, and the single-serving milk cartons they often contain, are a mainstay for food-insecure households, like this one in Gary, Ind.

Kenneally arrived in Illinois in early June, soon after nationwide unemployment claims filed during the pandemic had topped 40 million.

In Cicero, just west of Chicago, Jennifer Villa, 29, was living in an apartment with a kitchen that needed plumbing repairs. She and her family were already struggling — a disability makes it hard for her to work — and the pandemic had meant less fresh food and even longer pantry lines. Tap to cycle through images Temporarily without a working kitchen, Villa organized the food she received from food pantries in the alleyway outside her home. Whenever food deliveries came, Villa’s kids would celebrate. “Oh, Mommy, we’re going to have food tonight,” they would tell her. “We’re not going to go to sleep with no food in our tummy.” Armani Rodriguez Sonia Rodriguez

By June, the social upheavals following the killing of George Floyd created even more instability for some families. Kenneally visited Manausha Russ, 28, a few days after protests led to the closure of a nearby Family Dollar, where Russ used to get basics like milk, cereal and diapers. “The stores by my house were all looted,” she says. Tap to cycle through images From left, Aliza, 1, Nyla, 6, Amarri, 5, and Kadynce, 8, with their mother, Manausha Russ. Russ lives with her four daughters on the west side of St. Louis. She receives about $635 per month in food stamps, but with the girls at home all day, and her partner, Lamarr, there too, it isn’t always sufficient. “Some days I feel like I have a lot,” she says, “and some days I feel like I don’t have enough.” The family moved into their current apartment about six months ago. Russ doesn’t have a dining table or chairs yet, so the girls eat on the floor.

In so many places, Kenneally found food-insecure families were helping one another out despite their own hardship. Here, in a condominium complex on the city’s east side, a neighbor picked up free school lunches and distributed them to children in the building, including the Boughton sisters: Brooklyn, 4, on the far right, Chynna, 9, and Katie, 8, seen here with a neighbor’s toddler who has since moved away.

Most of the families Kenneally photographed had struggled to feed themselves adequately for years. But she also met families who had been thrown into food insecurity by the pandemic.

By late June, Kenneally had reached Mississippi, where the economic toll of Covid-19 was falling hard on some of America’s most chronically impoverished areas, where residents have lived under hunger’s shadow for years. The pandemic dropped the state’s labor participation rate to just 53 percent, the lowest in the nation.

Even before the pandemic, more than half of Mississippi’s seniors — 56 percent — experienced regular shortfalls in food. One in 4 Mississippians is now experiencing food insecurity, according to the nonprofit Feeding America.

He also catches bream from a local lake. “I cook about 10, and I put the rest of them up in the freezer. Then when we need to eat them, I defrost them.”

The city of Jackson (population 164,000) is often classified as a “food desert” for its high rate of food insecurity and the scarcity of well-stocked stores.

Treating hunger as a temporary emergency, instead of a symptom of systemic problems, has always informed the American response to it — and as a result government programs have been designed to alleviate each peak, rather than address the factors that produce them.

In early July, the pandemic was cresting in Texas just as Kenneally arrived.

Kelly Rivera, a single mother with three kids who makes $688 every two weeks as a teacher’s aide, goes to the food bank on Wednesdays to supplement what she is able to buy with food stamps. “There are times they give you what you need, and there are times they don’t give you what you need,” she says. “You can’t be picky.” Tap to cycle through images Rivera’s children eat Cheetos on the couch after returning home from picking up groceries.

Some 800 miles west in New Mexico, near the town of Hatch, workers pick onions for $15 a box, which translates to less than a minimum wage for many workers. There are no food pantries nearby, and so the workers are forced to eat extremely simply on their earnings, making nearly everything they eat from scratch. Tap to cycle through images At the beginning of the onion season, a priest came to the field at dawn to bless the harvest. Juan Pablo Reyes is using the money he made picking onions to help pay for college. “People that work at the bottom of the food chain, cultivating all these different crops, are basically the builders of our country,” he says. Yasmin and Yeslin Reyes, 11, are the only members of their family who don’t work in the onion fields, but that will change next summer. Their older brothers started when they turned 12, and the same is expected of them. Juan Pablo’s high school graduation cap says “Proud Immigrant” and has flowers in the colors of the Mexican flag.

Leaving New Mexico, Kenneally headed west across Arizona. She finished her journey in Southern California at the end of July. The story there was no different than it had been across the country, except that wildfires were also beginning to ravage the state — yet another crisis in a year full of them.

Kenneally’s photographs reveal the fragility of American life, exposed and exacerbated by the pandemic. They show us how close to the edge so many families live, how vulnerable and insecure their arrangements are, and also how resilient they can be when faced with a crisis.

But nothing stands out from these images more vividly than the children: eating whatever they can, whenever and wherever they can, somehow managing to maintain, in the midst of this historically desperate time, some innocence and some hope. Hatch, N.M. Gary, Ind. Parma, Ohio Houston

They are the greatest victims of the food-insecurity crisis. Research has shown long-term links between food insecurity and a wide variety of health issues in children — elevated risks of asthma and other chronic illnesses, lags in educational attainment.

61,"May 31, 2020",CNN,'Not moving fast enough': Millions of children still without food aid,"(CNN) Millions of low-income school children are still waiting receive federal help to buy food, even as the number of families having trouble affording groceries skyrockets .

Eleven states, including Georgia, Mississippi and Utah, have yet to join the federal coronavirus relief program that gives families money in place of the meals their children would have received in school for free or a reduced price.

But even in states already participating in the Pandemic EBT program , millions of children haven't gotten assistance -- more than two months after schools closed.

""We know that families are losing jobs and wages, and P-EBT really is an amazing support that can help these families, but it's not moving fast enough,"" said Crystal FitzSimons, director of school programs at the Food Research & Action Center. ""It is concerning that it's taking so long and we know that families are in crisis.""

Congress created the Pandemic EBT program as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in mid-March, when states started shuttering schools, making it harder for children to receive these crucial meals.

Some 22 million children eat a free or reduced-price lunch at school each day, on average. While districts are trying to provide alternative arrangements, it's only reaching a small fraction of those in need.

At the same time, food insecurity among families is growing as unemployment soars amid the pandemic. More than 40% of mothers with children age 12 and under said in April that the food they bought didn't last and they didn't have enough money to get more, up from about 15% in 2018, according to a recent survey from the Brookings Institution.

""Looking over time, particularly to the relatively small increase in child food insecurity during the Great Recession, it is clear that young children are experiencing food insecurity to an extent unprecedented in modern times,"" wrote Lauren Bauer, the survey's author.

Money for meals

The Pandemic EBT provision provides about $114 a month per child, which is the value of a free breakfast and lunch for five school days a week. Eligible families will receive the funds for the time their schools were closed, typically from mid-March, until the end of the school year sometime in May or June, depending on the state.

The program, however, has been challenging to set up. It took three weeks for the US Department of Agriculture to approve the first state -- Michigan -- and only 17 states were given the nod in April. Another 21 states have received the go-ahead so far in May.

But even once they get approval, states face multiple hurdles in getting the funds to families, particularly those who aren't already in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. In many states, there are far more eligible households in this category than those who receive food stamps, who will simply have the additional funds added to their existing benefit cards.

States have to work with their school districts to identify all the qualified children in households that aren't on food stamps and then send them benefit cards with the funds.

Also, they have to pick up the ""not inconsiderable"" cost of issuing the cards to these households at a time when they are suffering budget crunches, said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Some states are automatically providing the funds to families who don't receive food stamps. But others -- including California, Missouri and Illinois -- are requiring them to apply for the benefit, sometimes because it's harder for the school districts to transfer the records to the social service agencies. But this may delay or prevent some households from participating.

Many states have started sending funds to families, particularly those already in the food stamp program. But many others, including New York, Maryland and Florida -- which together have more than 4.5 million eligible children, have said they won't distribute the money until June at the earliest.

In Virginia, the roughly 620,000 eligible children should have their Pandemic EBT funds on the families' cards or in the mail by Monday, at the latest, said Duke Storen, commissioner of the state's Department of Social Services.

The agency, which received federal approval in late April, had been concerned that it would take more time to deliver the benefits to the children who needed cards -- about half the total -- because of a limited supply. However, the vendor recently delivered the full batch, allowing the state to distribute the funds more quickly.

Still, Storen knows the money -- $376 per child for 66 missed days of school -- can't come soon enough for some children and their parents.

""While I wish we could have put the benefit in the hands of families sooner -- they needed them a month ago, but they also need these benefits today,"" said Storen, whose agency spent $2 million to administer the program, half of which will be reimbursed by the federal government.

Not yet participating

Nearly a dozen states, however, have yet to join the program, and that has an impact on their young residents.

At Marietta City Schools in Georgia, 60% of the 8,000 students would qualify for the Pandemic EBT, according to Superintendent Grant Rivera.

Even with the grab-and-go meal program they have offered while the schools have been closed, it's been difficult to reach all the eligible students, he told CNN. Only 34% of have participated.

Having a card with money on it would be a ""game-changer for kids,"" he said.

""What I've seen overwhelmingly is that they desperately need this food,"" Rivera said. ""And I've heard anecdotally from countless families that they've lost their jobs. Unemployment has not processed. They literally don't know how they're going to feed their kids.""

Utah, meanwhile, was unable to apply because of ""several obstacles in data collection,"" a spokesperson for the state Department of Workforce Services told CNN in a statement.

""Looking at the guidelines we found several obstacles in data collection of students receiving free and reduced lunch in order to determine eligibility,"" said spokesman Brooke Porter Coles. ""This obstacle made it difficult to meet the deadline for participation. Utah is diligently working with our federal and educational partners to create a solution in order to provide this benefit.""","(CNN) Millions of low-income school children are still waiting receive federal help to buy food, even as the number of families having trouble affording groceries skyrockets .

62,"Jun 10, 2020",EcoWatch,UN Warns of Impending Food Crisis,"The United Nations issued a dire warning on Tuesday that the world stands on the brink of the worst food crisis in the last 50 years, according to The Guardian.



The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world is facing an ""impending global food emergency"" that could impact hundreds of millions of people as the coronavirus pandemic threatens already strained supply chains, according to Hong Kong-based Asia Times. He warned that the recessions that follow the pandemic will put basic nutrition out of reach for millions.

""Our food systems are failing, and the Covid-19 pandemic is making things worse,"" the UN chief said in a statement accompanying a report by the UN. ""More than 820 million people are hungry. ""Some 144 million children under the age of five are stunted – more than one in five children worldwide."" That's particularly troubling as malnutrition has lifelong consequences. If the number of children who suffer from malnutrition grows, it is likely to cause increased stunting and provide a future strain on health care systems.

Guterres warned that ""this year, some 49 million extra people may fall into extreme poverty due to the Covid-19 crisis,"" according to Asia Times. ""Unless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending global food emergency that could have long-term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults,"" as The Guardian reported. ""We need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic."" The UN Secretary-General provided a three-point plan for attacking the hunger crisis: focus aid on the worst-stricken areas to avoid immediate disaster, to improve social safety nets so children, pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers along with other at-risk group receive adequate nutrition, and to invest in healthy and sustainable food systems and supply chains for the future, according to Guterres' statement.

The latest data in the report, The Impact of COVID-19 on Food Security and Nutrition, found that the food security of 135 million people is at crisis level or worse. That number could nearly double before the end of the year due to the impacts of COVID-19. Increasing unemployment and the loss of income associated with lockdowns are also putting food out of reach for many struggling people, the report found, according to The Guardian. While global markets have remained steady, the cost for basic foods has begun to rise in some countries. The report also expects harvests to slow down, since many seasonal laborers are unable to work or travel for work. Meanwhile, despite the impending crisis, food waste is surging as farmers are finding themselves in the unenviable position of dumping perishable food because of supply chain problems, as The Guardian reported.","The United Nations issued a dire warning on Tuesday that the world stands on the brink of the worst food crisis in the last 50 years, according to The Guardian.

63,"Sep 27, 2020",Arkansas Online,Pandemic has fewer kids getting meals at schools,"In a state where many children didn't get enough to eat before the pandemic, changes to kindergarten-through-12th-grade education threaten to widen the hunger divide.

Participation in school meal programs -- a linchpin in children's nutrition, especially for those who get free or reduced-price lunches -- has dropped in many districts around the state this fall, administrators say.

That's true even though most districts opted in on a federal program that allows all students to eat at no out-of-pocket costs through December.

More than half of Arkansas' schoolchildren are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, so missed lunches and breakfasts indicate potential gaps in access to food as schools move to feed the kids in new ways. Missed meals are also troubling indicators, experts say, amid an upswing in nationwide food insecurity tied to this year's economic recession.

In Arkansas and elsewhere, the recession-tied burden weighs most heavily on Black, Hispanic and other children of color and their families, experts and advocates say.

""Anywhere there's a hungry child, I can guarantee you there's an entire hungry family"" because parents will go without to make sure their kids are fed, said Arkansas Food Bank Chief Executive Officer Rhonda Sanders. ""I think most people tend to forget that.""

Since schools reopened in August, just a fraction of families who chose to have their children attend classes virtually are going to school to pick up breakfasts and lunches, officials say. Also, the number of students getting their meals in school cafeterias is down, attributed to safety fears unassuaged by extra cleaning and food-packaging measures.

In the Pocahontas School District, about 300 students chose all-virtual learning this fall, and child nutrition director Patty Moore said she is sending food home for approximately 30 of them each week. That can mean the district will receive less in reimbursements for meals served, she said, and saddle families with the extra food costs.

Even if families in the area are among a recent surge in state applicants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) -- a successor to the food stamp program -- ""I know it's costing more for them to [feed kids at home] than if their kids come to school and eat,"" Moore said.

The same situation is evident among remote learners in the Fort Smith and North Little Rock school districts. In the latter, a spokesman estimated that fewer than 25% of the district's virtual learners are going to schools to get their meals, and acknowledged that ""transportation might be an issue.""

The Arkansas Department of Education isn't tracking specific data on meals distributed to virtual learners, but the agency's Child Nutrition Unit has fielded calls from administrators concerned about meal participation this school year, spokeswoman Kim Mundell wrote in an email.

Accounts from districts overall point to children eating less frequently at school and having less access to food since the spring pandemic community lockdowns.

In May, one national survey found that four in 10 adults with children eligible for free and reduced-price lunches weren't getting replacement assistance, said food insecurity expert Elaine Waxman.

Across the country, news reports this summer documented long lines of cars and unprecedented demand at food banks as millions of people lost jobs and businesses closed because of the pandemic.

Waxman, who is a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank The Urban Institute, said this fall's reports of fewer children eating school-provided meals ""doesn't surprise"" her and ""is probably not an indication that families don't need the help -- just that the logistics may work against participation.""

Jeremy Everett, founder and executive director of the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, said he has heard a few similar concerns about lower school meals participation, though it's not enough to know if the situation is nationwide.

""Many of the children are at home alone while their parents work and are unable to leave to go get their meals,"" he said in an email.

""It seems that the primary barrier is transportation. Children and parents are having a difficult time getting to the meals to pick them up when available, and schools do not have the capacity to make home deliveries.""

The end of many coronavirus relief programs, such as the weekly $600 unemployment insurance supplement that expired in July, coupled with sporadic or skipped meals offered through schools undermine efforts to keep kids from going hungry.

Those efforts, which experts and officials view as successful, include many districts opting in on a U.S. Department of Agriculture waiver that allows districts to serve children free lunches even if the family's income is higher than the usually limit. The program will cover about $80 million in costs through December, state Education Secretary Johnny Key said at a Sept. 2 media briefing.

The initiative will reduce administrative burdens at schools, as well as worry for families who ""might not qualify for free meals, but are still going through a tough time,"" Key said.

Melanie Hyso, 42, of Bentonville said efforts by state and federal governments this year helped her feed her 16-year-old, 12-year-old and 7-year-old. She praised the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) assistance program, which federal legislation created in March. It offered $319 per child for families eligible for free or reduced-price lunches because schools had closed.

Hyso said she's ""so grateful' for the assistance card, which arrived later than she'd expected, during the costly run-up to the fall semester.

""You're trying to get supplies, and clothes, and shoes, and all this stuff, and I'm like, 'oh my god, where is it?'"" she said.

While schools were shut down in the spring and summer, her district delivered basic meals -- corn dogs, sandwiches, vegetable sticks -- to the family's house. Her son's mentor and a therapist sometimes chipped in to help, at one point dropping off a birthday cake, she said.

All of it, she said, helped during a period of budgets strained by the kids spending more time at home, using more electricity to run their learning devices or eating lunch at home rather than at school.

""We've gotten really good at getting creative,"" she said.

'GRAB AND GO'

Declining participation in school meal programs is the most recent challenge in feeding kids during a year administrators say is out of the ordinary and stressful, and began with the abrupt closure of schools in the state in mid-March.

The closures presented a challenge for districts trying to feed thousands of children who were no longer going to school every day, especially kids who rely on free and reduced-price school lunches and breakfasts.

That's the majority of Arkansas schoolchildren, state Department of Education data show. Of 263 districts and charter schools in Arkansas, 223 had more than half of their students participate in those meals programs in the 2019-20 school year. The Marvell-Elaine School District and the Helena/West Helena School District have more than 95% of students enrolled in meals programs.

Ally Mrachek, child nutrition director for Fayetteville Public Schools, said she ""kind of saw the writing on the wall"" and began planning before schools closed last spring, but she called the experience ""surreal"" nonetheless.

""We saw other districts across the country closing, and we weren't getting a lot of communication in our state,"" she said. ""We were driving forklifts and box trucks, and really trying to move food as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.""

By March 20, the USDA relaxed several of its rules on school nutrition programs, including those pertaining to eating in group settings, what time children must eat and prohibitions on parents picking up food.

Food banks in the state also joined in, packing emergency boxes, connecting children with commodities programs and distributing ""farm to family"" food boxes.

Common strategies for districts included facilitating meal pickup hours for families and delivering meals to community drop points or neighborhoods, officials said. But there were challenges.

For example, El Dorado School District workers packed some lunches not knowing whether families had access to refrigeration or freezers at home, said Kim Newman, the district's child nutrition director.

By summer, more rule modifications, extensions of waivers and an existing districtwide free student meals program allowed the food providers to drive into neighborhoods and feed any child they saw, she said.

""We would just roll down the windows and say, 'Hey, are you hungry? Want some lunch?'"" Newman said.

Summer food programs adapted menus to better ensure food safety, including ""more sandwich-type meals,"" because food has to be served at a certain temperature, said Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education Director Tonya Williams. She said programs for young kids shifted similarly, offering ""grab and go"" meals, though most of those programs now have reverted to their normal format.

""We're seeing a lot of people go back to work and have to be somewhere, so there's less of a need for 'grab and go' options,"" she said.

NO QUICK FIX

Food insecurity -- largely a measure of economic struggles -- is different from hunger. It means not consistently having enough money to buy food. For example, a woman who is food insecure might run out of money to buy food before payday and have to change her eating habits or cut out a meal.

It's long been a problem in Arkansas, a state with many low-income households. In 2018, the state had the nation's second-highest rate of food insecurity, behind only Mississippi, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Feeding America. The group operates six food banks in Arkansas.

Food insecurity is expected to increase this year because of the pandemic, a group of researchers from that organization found. Researchers project food insecurity rates will increase by 50% or more in Benton, Washington, Saline, Carroll, Lonoke and Faulkner counties, and grow at least 24% in every county in the state.

Experts say it can take years for a family to recover from a period of food insecurity -- similar to what was seen during the recession in 2008, when it took between seven and 10 years for households to recover.

The pandemic has thrown more than 10 million kids, whose families struggle with access to food, in turmoil this year, said Crystal FitzSimons, director of school and out-of-school programs at the Washington, D.C.,-based Food Research and Action Center.

Normally in times of economic shocks like job loss, a parent can sign up through schools for food assistance programs for their kids, but the pandemic upended that.

""We had a hunger crisis before the pandemic, and the pandemic just made it worse,"" she said. ""This was a situation where, overnight, communities had to try to figure out how to set up these feeding programs.""

Early responses from communities and the government drew praise from advocates. Those responses included boosts in unemployment benefits as facilitated by the federal Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act; $1,200 payments to many Americans; the P-EBT aid program; and relying on distribution frameworks in existing summer food programs.

The federal government also briefly bumped up SNAP payments and waived several requirements around the program to make it easier for people to enroll, said Mary Franklin, Division of County Operations Director, which oversees the program in Arkansas.

But experts expressed concern about some limits in the response, including stalled negotiations in Congress regarding a new coronavirus relief package. Also, continued funding for the P-EBT program depends on the passage of a congressional spending bill that cleared the House on Tuesday.

In this year's unprecedented crisis, families also may encounter complex problems. For example, mixed-immigration-status families might not apply for pandemic aid that they're entitled to, fearing that it might affect their future citizenship applications, the Urban Institute's Waxman said.

""If you're already vulnerable, then the pandemic is just layered on that,"" she said.

State data bears out the rising need, with nearly 10,000 more households enrolled in SNAP in August than in April. Food banks across the state also are ""seeing increases"" in people seeking help, and a rise in food insecurity is expected, said Sanders, the food bank CEO.

""It's not going to just automatically drop back to where it was. There's too many jobs that have been lost; there's too many dollars that have been pulled out of the economy,"" she said.

FUTURE WORRIES

School lunch and breakfast programs can significantly ease a family's food budget by providing as many as 10 meals a week (and sometimes more for very low-income families) -- which is why a decline in their use is viewed as worrisome.

The goal is for children to lead healthy, productive lives, and ""that's impossible"" if they're hungry, said Melvin Clayton, race equity director for advocacy at Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. Experts link growing up in a food-insecure household with later-in-life health challenges, such as cognitive delays, asthma and other chronic illnesses.

Several Arkansas school districts -- including the large Benton, Bentonville, Fayetteville and Cabot districts -- are in counties where food insecurity is projected to increase the most while also seeing historically low rates of free and reduced-price lunch participation, suggesting a gap between what's happened in the past and what may be needed.

This year, the Education Department's child nutrition unit has recommended that schools develop community partnerships to help connect virtually-educated students with meals, and review and revise distribution plans if participation is low. Some districts have experimented with food pickup times, moving to once-weekly or evening pickups.

Meal distribution is ""costly,"" the Department of Education spokeswoman said, and there are no USDA funds available to help districts shoulder it.

The Arkansas Food Bank is establishing a handful of on-campus food pantries at schools around the state in a pilot program, and Sanders said it has prepared to shift back to assembling emergency food boxes quickly in case schools are forced to close on a large scale again.

Beyond schools, advocates support the extension and expansion of relief programs, encouraging less restrictive rules and urging community leaders to speak out against the perceived stigma of people using those programs. One rule that should be waived, they say, is Arkansas' ""asset limit"" of $2,250 on hand to qualify for SNAP aid.

For students attending school in person and eating on campus, much is changed in cafeterias and classrooms because of the pandemic. There are physical distancing measures, staggered lunch hours, and changes in how students handle food and condiments. Disposable utensils, dishes and cups are being used, but that also increases schools' costs and trash.

Across districts, food being sent home -- sometimes because of students suddenly being sent into quarantine -- is usually straightforward and child-friendly. Meal options include chicken nuggets or spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch, and cereal or string cheese for breakfast.

School officials say there's some uncertainty about what the rest of the school year will look like.

Mrachek, the Fayetteville director, said that's prompted her to try to sign up as many families as possible for free and reduced-price meals for the spring semester, even families that may not have used such programs in the past. Toward that end, the district created videos in English and Spanish to explain the applications, which schools must submit by Oct. 1.

""Families won't rebound as fast as that cutoff date [in December for USDA waiver programs]. I don't know if families will be back on their feet by then,"" she said.

Palm Beach County is the state’s number one agricultural producing county, growing vegetables in the winter when other states are too cold, and sugar cane and rice. It’s been an economic engine for decades, with some farmers in business here since the 1930s.

With an estimated $1.4 billion in agricultural sales for 2017-18, Palm Beach County leads all counties east of the Mississippi River, according to the Palm Beach County Cooperative Extension Service. Among the bounty is enough lettuce to make 1 billion salads a year and enough sweet corn to supply 150 million people for two months.

What’s ahead for the industry that dates to the 1870s, when serious commercial farming began with pineapples and tomatoes? Will it be run over by development or bought out for additional water conservation or Everglades restoration projects?

It's a fair question to ask given the trends in counties to our south, where lands used for farming got paved over for residential development from Homestead to Dania Beach. Another potentially undermining factor are environmental concerns, specifically discharges from Lake Okeechobee.

>>PALM BEACH COUNTY 2030: How will we grow? The next decade promises significant changes to the landscape and look of Palm Beach County. READ MORE

Palm Beach County farmers say they see viability and longevity for their agribusiness.

“There are a thousand people a day moving into Florida, and land availability is becoming a scarcity,"" said Paul Allen, chairman of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association (FFVA). ""But I think that our lawmakers and government, every time I talk to them, they understand that for seven months out of the year, fresh fruit and vegetables coming out of Florida take care of 80 million people east of the Mississippi.”

>>Palm Beach County in 2030: Hispanics leading the way for population growth

For starters, Allen and others say, there is a greater emphasis today on food security — so lands dedicated to farming are viewed with greater importance. Despite encroachment by development, county farmers are generally thriving, boosted by new technologies, disease-resistant crops and diversity of crop varieties.

Allen is also president of Pahokee-based R.C. Hatton Farms. The farm produces sugar cane, sweet corn and green beans on 10,000 acres in Palm Beach County.

“Food is a matter of national security. Our government understands that totally. I think they will provide for land in Florida to be farmed on,” Allen said.

With billions of dollars from packinghouses to sugar mills, harvesting equipment, transportation systems and more invested in one of the nation’s most ideal growing regions, agribusiness is thriving in western Palm Beach County and around the farming communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee and South Bay and in Loxahatchee to the east. Major vegetable growers continue to produce in the Agricultural Reserve west of the turnpike in south county, although their numbers are shrinking as residential and commercial development increases.

>>Palm Beach County in 2030: Hoteliers hot to keep up with demand for leisure, business travelers

About 36 percent of the county’s land mass, or just over 451,000 acres, was in agriculture in 2017-18, according to Palm Beach County property appraiser records.

Palm Beach County’s production is primarily in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) south of Lake Okeechobee, where sugar cane accounts for 390,767 acres. In the Glades, Loxahatchee, and the Ag Reserve, vegetables are grown in multiple plantings per season on close to 25,000 acres, appraiser records show. Tropical fruit groves, 396 landscape nurseries, land for horses, goats, swine, honey production, fish farms and sod farms make up the rest.

New technology and improved disease-resistant and constantly evolving crop varieties developed by U.S. Department of Agriculture and University of Florida researchers are also helping farmers to become more efficient and produce more per acre.

>>Palm Beach County in 2030: New western communities attract buyers — and raise traffic concerns

“My hope is that they remain the economic engine they are,"" said Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay, who represents the Glades. ""It is a multi-billion(-dollar) economic engine in our county. They are going to face pressure from different sources.”

One of those ""sources"" is pressure to curtail, or resolve, the dispute over discharges of fresh water from Lake Okeechobee, which are believed to pollute waterways a with toxic algae and raise other water quality issues.

McKinlay said she worries that ""extremists"" on both sides of the Lake Okeechobee water discharge battle seek to force out farmers.

“Some of those extremists would like to see agriculture disappear and turn that all into wetlands and restoration areas. It is important that we grow our own produce domestically. We need to protect the farming communities that are able to do that for us,” McKinlay said.

McKinlay adds that forcing out the farmers might open land to even more damaging uses.

“My fear if we were to eliminate agriculture in the western communities is that we would see one of four things — oil drilling, phosphate mining, aggregate mining or intensive development. I don’t think any of those are environmentally friendly in that part of the county,” McKinlay said.

Residential development would be an option, as happened in both Miami-Dade and Broward counties to the south.

“I never want to fly over the Glades communities and look downward and see something like Weston,” McKinlay said. “We are struggling right now with discharges and water storage. It will not be any better if we turn it all into gated communities. My hope for 2030 is a thriving agricultural industry that continues to improve their technology to be more efficient.”

Growers say their future is in new crops, not new homes, and one in particular, hemp.

Farmers are always looking to diversify with a new crop, whether it’s mini-peppers, micro-greens or kale, and there’s increasing interest in growing hemp for products such as fiber, forages to feed cattle, building materials and food such as hemp seed oil and greens and medicinal cannabidiol (CBD) extract in the near future.

After the May passage of legislation establishing a state hemp program, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said Florida is on the verge of creating what could become a multi-billion industry.

“Hemp is a big topic right now. You are always looking to diversify your operation,” said Keith Wedgworth, president of the Western Palm Beach County Farm Bureau and vice president of Wedgworth Farms, said. Wedgworth Farms, founded in 1932 in Belle Glade, farms and owns 10,000 acres of sugar cane and rice.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the legislation legalizing industrial hemp production, so now the rule-making process will begin.

Zachary Brym, an assistant professor of agro-ecology at the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead leads UF’s Industrial Hemp Pilot Project.

For now, hemp production is limited to UF facilities. Production trials are under way at UF research centers in Homestead, Hague (near Gainesville) and Quincy (near Tallahassee). The project needs to identify the best hemp varieties for the region as well as how existing farming equipment and operations can be adapted.

At a recent meeting in Belle Glade, Brym explained that hemp is not marijuana, although they are the same species of plant, Cannabis sativa. Industrial hemp has less than 0.3 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical that at a higher level defines marijuana.

Despite the buzz about hemp, farmers and industry experts believe vegetables and sugar cane will continue to make up most of the county’s agriculture for years to come.

But at least one hemp enterprise is on the horizon in Palm Beach County.

Whitworth Farms, a long-time Ag Reserve vegetable grower, has leased about 200 acres to Green Point Research of Fort Lauderdale with the goal of producing hemp. Green Point Research is also partnering with UF and initially donated 200,000 seeds and 100 living plants to the Industrial Hemp Pilot Project, with more to come.

That said, farmers acknowledge challenges in competing against global exports and imports.

Glenn Whitworth Jr. said that because of cheap produce coming in from Mexico, the farm, in business for 70 years, shuttered its vegetable operations for good in the spring of 2018.

U.S. and Florida growers of tomatoes, peppers, squash and other crops are fighting to survive in the face of increased competition from Mexico where subsidies are greater and production costs lower. The outcome of the signed but not ratified new trade agreement between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. — called USMCA, a renegotiation of NAFTA — does not include a trade remedy for U.S. specialty crop producers.

FFVA’s director of policy, Lisa Lochridge, said competition from the Mexican imports has reached a crisis stage for Florida growers of crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, squash, strawberries and blueberries. The Florida congressional delegation has said they will not vote for a USMCA that doesn’t include a solution.

With consumers demanding locally grown produce and a safe and secure food supply, however, the need for Florida produce is strong.

Lochridge said the demand for convenience packaging such as ready-to-microwave veggies will continue to accelerate. However, despite the healthful benefits of fruits and vegetables, consumption is down in the last few years.

“Consumer trends certainly dictate how our growers market their products,” Lochridge said. “Shoppers want somebody else to do the work for them. Convenience packaged foods and prepared meals are immensely popular.""

How the Palm Beach agri-industry will evolve in the next decade is also up to a key demographic group, millennials.

“Millennials are changing the landscape in their buying and eating habits. If you look at trends, they eat more smaller meals,” Lochridge added. “People want to eat on the go. Their choices may be less nutritious. We have to offer healthy nutritious fruit and vegetable options for that quick snacking.”

State Rep. Rick Roth, R-Wellington, president of Roth Farms with sugar cane and vegetables on 5,000 acres east of Belle Glade, agrees that a trade agreement with Mexico is needed to help the coastal farmers survive.

“It looks like the East Coast vegetable farming will continue to go down,” Roth said.

Farmers of lettuce, sweet corn and green beans grown in the Glades are not competing with Mexico, which doesn’t ship those in any significant amount, Roth said.

While Roth believes farming will continue to prosper in the Glades, he said more land could be taken out of agriculture for stormwater treatment areas. Due to the natural evaporation of muck, some land could become too shallow to farm.

“You will have some loss. What will be compensated is that sugar cane production is continuing to expand outside of Palm Beach County. Having more acres is the key to being sustainable,” Roth said.

In the Glades, where Belle Glade’s slogan is “Her soil is her fortune,” the rich black muck isn’t suitable for construction, FFVA’s Allen said, although it can be done. Muck must be removed prior to building.

“They do build on it, but as far as mass production, it is different. The best use for the mucklands in the EAA is production. Its highest and best use is to produce food,” Allen said.

Water issues are at the top of growers’ concerns statewide, and they want to be part of the solution for clean, sustainable water long term for all of Florida, Allen said.

In 1992, the county’s agricultural acreage was 576,012, compared to today’s approximately 450,000 acres. Much of the difference of 126,181 acres is due to the South Florida Water Management District buying more than 100,000 acres for stormwater treatment areas and other restoration projects over the last 15 to 20 years.

Since 2008, the number of agricultural acres in Palm Beach County has decreased by only 17,033 acres, according to Palm Beach County Property Appraiser records. Farmers say that it’s crucial that no more land be taken out of production in the Glades.

“Agriculture will remain a strong economic engine in Palm Beach County in 2030. The land mass devoted to agriculture may shrink due to environmental and development pressure. However, variety development and advanced agricultural practices will yield more food per acre,” said Barbara Miedema, president of Wellington-based Terra-Rio Consulting, who has worked for years in the sugar industry.

Farm Bureau president Wedgworth said he hopes the acreage has stabilized, but that of course no one knows for sure.

There must be enough cane production to support the Glades’ four sugar mills. A reduction could cause the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida’s mill to fail and small to-medium-sized farmers would be hurt the most, Wedgworth said.

Despite the shrinkage, farmers have continued to produce more per acre. They have also invested millions in new state-of-the-art production and packing facilities such as those at Pioneer Growers and Ray’s Heritage in the Glades, and Alderman Farms, which has a 300-acre organic farm in Loxahatchee and farms in the Ag Reserve.

In the Ag Reserve, where development pressure is greater, the future is less certain as the number of houses built approaches 10,000. A $100 million bond issue passed by Palm Beach County voters in 1999 resulted in county purchasing 2,335 acres in the Ag Reserve. The land is leased back to farmers.

However, in 2018, the Palm Beach County Commission extended the leases for 35 more years for 1,138 acres to long-time farming family and tree nursery owners the Bowmans, and 262 acres leased to the Bedners. The Bedners have been farming cucumbers and peppers in Palm Beach County since 1960.

Other major vegetable-growing operations in the Ag Reserve include Pero Family Farms, Thomas Produce, Yee Farms, Alderman Farms, Mecca Farms and herb grower Pontano, along with nurseries and equestrian facilities.

A new venture in the Ag Reserve is Green Life Farms, a hydroponic greenhouse and packing facility on 3 acres off State Road 7 west of Lake Worth Beach, which expects to produce 750,000 pounds of baby leafy greens per year.

Elayne Dudley, sales director at Green Life, said construction is nearing completion. The facility will include 100,00 square feet of growing space, plus packaging and office space. It expects to begin commercial operation in midsummer.

In Loxahatchee, farms such as vegetable producer J & J Farms, which partners with Thomas Produce, Swank Specialty Produce, and several fruit and vegetable growers along with ornamental plant nurseries, are thriving. Some sugar cane is planted on the sand lands there.

The sugar cane industry has expanded more onto sand lands, and to other counties, such as Hendry and Glades. It’s vertically integrated, providing farm-to-table products. The cane produced in Florida goes through sugar mills and then refineries that are owned by the growers. Sugar cane producers have their own packaging plants and distribute directly to retailers such as Publix and Walmart without a middleman, making profits larger.

U.S. Sugar Corp. has its own refinery in Clewiston. The Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative in Belle Glade and West Palm Beach-based Florida Crystals Corp. jointly own ASR Group. Headquartered in West Palm Beach, ASR is the world’s largest refiner and marketer of cane sugar, with an annual production capacity of more than 6 million tons of sugar

With the Glades is expected to remain a major sugar producer, what does that mean for future development?

Roth said that as available land in eastern Palm Beach County to becomes harder to find, and more expensive, the ability to develop properties in the Glades along main corridors will become a reality.

As to whether farmers will sell out, U.S. Sugar Corp. vice president Judy Sanchez said: “Farmers’ first option is to make their money farming. Like any other businessman, economics may force them to do something else. Then they must look at second or third options and selling land might be one of those.”

GPS-enabled tractors and drones used to check on crops and other technology used in precision agriculture continue to drive efficiency. More advances such as driverless tractors being rolled out by John Deere and other companies, are expected in the next few years.

U.S. Sugar has the nation’s largest private Wi-Fi network across more than 200,000 acres of its sugar cane and vegetable farms, Sanchez said. It’s also the “alpha” site for new harvesting software utilizing a technology similar to Uber, but for tractors. An app locates the nearest available wagon and sends it to the harvester.

“Much of our farm equipment is now 'smart' equipment, including AutoSteer mechanical harvesters that harvest our sugar cane crops,” Sanchez said.

“Our fleet of tractors and harvesters are equipped with GPS technology that reduce fuel use, enable precise fertilization right at the plants’ roots and increase yield at harvest as plants are in perfectly straight rows,"" said Marianne Martinez, vice president at Florida Crystals Corp.

“Satellite imagery guides our remote sensing and allows us to instantly detect pressure from disease, insects, water, either too much or too little, or weather, such as freeze damage, on a farm-by-farm basis and rapidly address it,” Martinez added. “In the past these activities were done visually by driving around the farming area or through helicopters.”

In 2018, Florida Crystals and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative invested $80 million to launch Tellus Products. At its plant near Belle Glade, leftover sugar cane fiber is converted into eco-friendly compostable tableware and food-service products that are in high demand as alternatives to plastic and Styrofoam. Tellus is in production and has created more than 80 local jobs.

“The crop mix may change over time due to market demands, but sugar cane production will remain the signature crop in the Glades due to the high investments in manufacturing and value-added facilities,” said Terra-Rio's Miedema.

Other possible new developments in the Glades include an inland port and a commerce center.

Gaston Cantens, vice president at Florida Crystals, said the inland port project, also known as the South Florida Intermodal Logistics Center, is on hold for now, as the demand isn’t there yet. The proposal to build the distribution center on 850 acres the sugar company owns off U.S. 27 just north of South Bay in unincorporated Palm Beach County has been under discussion for about a decade.

However, a major commerce park could be coming to Belle Glade soon. In 2014, a group of Wellington-based investors paid $1.2 million for a 212-acre parcel in Belle Glade that once housed Glades Correctional Institution. Now the investor group, BGI International, is selling land to companies who want to operate there.

Last year, the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County announced that Universal Forest Products, a major manufacturer of concrete construction productions, paid $33.7 million for the land and planned to build a 400,000-square-foot factory on the former prison site and employ 200 people.

Two companies are already operating from the property. Grower’s Management, a grower of leafy greens, sweet corn and green beans, occupies three remodeled office buildings, and World Trade Petroleum has equipment there.

Belle Glade City Manager Lomax Harrelle and BGI managing partner Henry Rionda did not respond to requests for comment on the project’s status.

“The project has not fully come to fruition, and I am not at liberty to discuss details since there are some remaining issues,"" said Shereena Coleman, vice president for business facilitation and the Glades region at the Business Development Board of the Palm Beaches.

“Agriculture will always be the fabric of the Glades community due to the massive amount of land currently in production, and we are not seeing any conversions to other uses,” Coleman said.

The BDB is also working with the Pahokee Marina and Campground and restaurant to find an operator, which would jump-start that city, Coleman added.

Belle Glade, Pahokee and South Bay all fall within the state’s South Central Rural Areas of Economic Opportunity, making projects eligible for certain waivers, bonuses and incentives. The BDB is marketing a piece of land in South Bay for manufacturing/light industrial, Coleman said.

One positive sign is the large number of young people choosing to work in Palm Beach County agriculture.

The Florida Farm Bureau’s Young Farmers & Ranchers Group in Palm Beach County has a couple dozen members, and farmers say that says a lot about the strength and long-term viability of the county’s agriculture.

Luis Ruiz grew up in Belle Glade, surrounded by vast acres of farmland with ink-black muck soil. Although his family doesn’t own any agricultural land, Ruiz chose a career in the industry.

At 18, he started working for Wedgworth Farms. Now 25, he’s assistant farm manager, where his duties include overseeing planting. Growing crops that supply food for people is rewarding, he said and he sees a future for the industry.

“I knew this is what I wanted to do and be. The people are great. It’s like a family,” said Ruiz, who took business classes at Palm Beach State College. “It is never the same. It’s different every day.”

66,"Aug 30, 2019",Healthcare Finance News,SDOH: Food insecurity adds $53 billion annually to healthcare costs,"Food insecurity costs the health system an additional $53 billion a year, according to Dr. Hilary Seligman, senior medical advisor for Feeding America and co-author of a study that looks at the issue state-by-state.

Food insecurity can lead to diabetes, heart disease and other chronic conditions, all of which are costly to health and the healthcare system.

""What's important to understand is the connection between food insecurity and health,"" said Seligman, an associate professor at the University of California San Francisco. ""When people don't have enough money for food, they use coping strategies, shifting their dietary intake to unhealthy food. It's these coping strategies that are so poor for your health.""

Also, she said, ""Being chronically ill is expensive in the U.S. Money is going to healthcare rather than the food budget.""

Over a lifetime, it's hard to undo the effects of a poor diet and its consequences.

""A small improvement in children may have enormous outcomes in the future,"" Seligman said.

Food insecurity encompasses more than hunger, or wondering where the next meal is coming from. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Food insecurity has become a major issue for hospitals, which have been making the transition to value-based care and its goal to keep people healthy.

Chronic conditions are a major reason for hospital admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits, all of which are targeted in value-based payment models.

Illness in a value-based system cannot be addressed without identifying the underlying environmental, social and behavioral issues that drive ill health.

Payers Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers offer incentives to reward wellness, coordinated care and better health outcomes.

Anthem Foundation Executive Director Lance Chrisman, who has worked for Anthem's philanthropic arm for about 13 years, said food insecurity has always been an issue, but in the past five years, the talk about addressing the social determinants of health has ramped up.

The foundation is flooded with requests for funding and gives an estimated $16 million to various programs each year.

But one of the primary areas of focus for the Anthem Foundation is food insecurity.

""When we start seeing the data and background: one in eight Americans, 40 million adults, 12 million children struggle with food insecurity,"" Chrisman said.

WHAT'S BEING DONE

The Anthem Foundation recently partnered with The Food Trust and its community-based program, the Healthy Food Retail Initiative, to increase access to healthy food in Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and San Jose, California.

The Anthem Foundation gave a $350,000 grant to the Food Trust Program to launch beta testing in those cities to take the Healthy Food Retail Initiative to scale.

The money subsidizes the cost of fresh fruit, produce and other healthy food to be sold at low cost in 37 existing brick and mortar markets and convenience stores. This includes five additional communities on the Eastside of Indianapolis, where these locations also serve as community health hubs providing health screenings, nutrition education and cooking lessons.

A 2019 Fitness Index found that only 33.9 percent of Indianapolis residents are eating two or more fruits a day and just 15.1 percent of residents are eating three or more vegetables each day. Data also showed more than one in three Indianapolis residents live in low food access areas where fresh food is difficult to find.

Anthem has made other food insecurity investments in the Feeding America program, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks, a program for college students in Virginia and in Blessings in a Backpack for elementary school kids.

This is food as medicine, Chrisman said.

""We believe eating healthy is just as important as taking medications,""

Seligman said individuals pay more attention to the edict to take advantage of better food choices available on-site at the hospital grocery pantry or the local food bank, if that comes from their physician.

""It feels the same as getting a prescription,"" Seligman said.

However, she said, ""The best answer for a food insecure household is SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).""

Hospitals are also a good source of finding people who are food insecure.

THE LARGER TREND

""We're just at the tip of the iceberg to understand whether they're working,"" Seligman said of programs. ""We think if they're supporting food security, they're working.""

Hospitals, insurers and organizations nationwide have launched food insecurity, housing and other social determinants of health initiatives. When Montifiore in New York City invested in housing the homeless, it realized a 300% return on investment from savings, such as fewer emergency room visits.

Massachusetts recently introduced the Massachusetts Food as Medicine State Plan.

At last count, 28 health systems had joined the Medicaid Transformation Project to improve the health of underserved individuals and to drive new solutions for untreated depression, teen suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder and mental illness.

""There is a vision of a much more broad scale support,"" Seligman said, adding, ""there is no financing mechanism.""

What motivated her report was being approached by food banks and healthcare partners that wanted to know the impact of food insecurity in their local communities.

THE DATA

The study, ""State-Level and County-Level Estimates of Health Care Costs Associated with Food Insecurity,"" includes an interactive map that breaks down healthcare costs associated with food insecurity on a state level.

For the analysis, the authors used 2011-2013 data from the National Health Interview Survey the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2012-2013 data from the Dartmouth Atlas and 2016 data from Map the Meal Gap 2018.

The authors found that among approximately 28 million food-insecure adults and 13 million food-insecure children in the United States in 2016, the excess cost associated with food insecurity translates to approximately $52.9 billion in excess healthcare expenditures.

Key findings include:

On average, healthcare costs for food insecure adults is $1,834 higher than people who are food secure.

The state with the highest healthcare cost per capita associated with food insecurity is Mississippi, at $243 per person. Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Oklahoma are also among the top five states.

The state with the lowest healthcare cost per capita associated with food insecurity is North Dakota, at $78 per person.

ON THE RECORD

""We've known for a long time,"" Seligman said, ""if we eliminate programs in food security, we end up with extra cost in the healthcare sector.""

67,"Dec 14, 2020",Uprise RI,"Food security, housing security and mental health for families: RI ranks near the bottom","A shocking new report from the Annie E Casey Foundation, Kids, Families and COVID-19: Pandemic Pain Points and a Roadmap for Recovery, shows that Rhode Island is falling below average when it comes to ensuring housing stability, mental health, and child hunger for families.

The KIDS COUNT report used data gathered from weekly weekly surveys conducted by the United States Census Bureau (the Census Pulse Survey) that shows that families are struggling to meet basic needs during this pandemic “while managing school, work, and mental health.”

“By measuring food security, the ability to make rent or mortgage payments, health insurance status, and mental health concerns, the Casey Foundation identified four pain points for children and families that require immediate action,” writes Rhode Island KIDS COUNT in a press release. “Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, and New Hampshire appeared among the top 10 states in terms of doing better on three or all four of the pain points identified in the report. States in the bottom 10 that were doing worse on three or all four categories were Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Texas.”

Percentages of Rhode Island families with children who have experienced challenges as measured by these four indicators are listed below. According to the Census Pulse Survey, in Rhode Island:

FOOD SECURITY: Nearly one in five families with children (18%) said that in the most recent week, there was sometimes or always not enough to eat in their household (compared to United States average of 14%). HOUSING STABILITY: Nearly one in four households with kids (23%) said they had only slight confidence or no confidence at all that they would be able to make their next rent or mortgage payment on time (compared to United States average of 18%). MENTAL HEALTH: A quarter of respondents with children in their households (25%) reported that they had felt down, depressed, or hopeless in the previous week, indicating a widespread need for access to mental health care (compared to United States average of 21%. AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE: 8% of adults in households with kids did not have health insurance (compared to United States average of 12%).

“All children deserve to have their basic needs met in normal times and in times of crisis,” said Elizabeth Burke Bryant, Executive Director of Rhode Island KIDS COUNT. “Too many Rhode Islanders were struggling to survive economically before this crisis. Now that the devastating effects of the pandemic are falling on the shoulders of our most vulnerable children and families, we need immediate and sustained action to ensure the best outcomes. Our leaders have taken some important actions to mitigate the effects of the crisis on kids, but Congress needs to do more. We call on Congress to pass another major relief bill that addresses the urgent needs of children and families.”

Though congressional action is needed to prevent the worst possible outcomes, the report does have some suggestions that can be implemented at the state and local levels.

In some states, fewer than 20% of unemployed workers received any support before the pandemic, and those excluded were disproportionately workers of color. Unemployment insurance did not rescue everyone who lost a job; many workers were ineligible or unable to claim it, and some families’ needs exceeded the temporary support. Expanding eligibility to include contract, gig and other workers would help more people weather gaps in income. In addition, more states should consider adopting a modest allowance for each child in a household. Twelve states have already done this. Even providing families with an extra $5 to $15 per week per child – as Iowa now offers, for example – would help parents make sure their children have enough food to eat.

Researchers have estimated that school systems need to spend 100% to 200% more per student from a low-income family and 100% to 150% more per English language learner in order to provide every student with the opportunity to achieve success. Yet some states provide as little as 10% more, in part because of heavy reliance on property taxes to fund schools . Additionally, equity policies in local school districts are a potentially powerful tool needed now for creating environments in which all kids can thrive. Equity policies serve as a guidepost for the work of a district and can provide the framework for how to embed a focus on racial equity in areas such as instruction, curriculum, discipline and resource allocation. They will be especially needed as schools face the reality that disparate access to technology and other resources is leading to more significant learning loss for some students during the pandemic than for others.

They will be especially needed as schools face the reality that disparate access to technology and other resources is leading to more significant learning loss for some students during the pandemic than for others. Children most often receive mental health services through the schools they attend. The American School Counselor Association recommends a student-to-counselor ratio of 250:1, but only three states – New Hampshire, Vermont and Wyoming – have ratios at least that low. Federal and state governments and local school districts could direct more funding toward hiring and equitably distributing counselors or making other investments in mental health services.

More generally, the Annie E Casey Foundation is calling on elected officials and other decision makers to:

Put racial and ethnic equity first in policymaking by using disaggregated data and engaging community stakeholders. This should ensure that the policymaking process is informed by the diverse perspectives of those hardest hit by the crisis and created in partnership with communities. This approach should underpin any concrete policy actions.

Prioritize the physical and mental health of all children by guaranteeing that any vaccine will be available without cost as a factor and by retaining and strengthening the Affordable Care Act. To promote mental health, particularly in times of crisis, policymakers should work to reduce the student-to-school-counselor ratio in all school settings to levels recommended by mental health professionals.

Help families with children achieve financial stability and bolster their well-being by expanding access to unemployment insurance for part-time and gig economy workers, low-wage workers, and students and by expanding child care access. Additionally, policymakers should eliminate barriers to accessing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). And beyond any temporary housing assistance programs aimed at heading off a foreclosure or eviction crisis, federal policymakers should expand the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and increase the overall availability of public housing.

Ensure schools are better funded, more equitably funded and ready to meet the needs of students disparately affected by the pandemic by boosting school funding to protect against the economic impact of the pandemic, build maintenance-of-equity requirements into relief packages and address disparities in technology access at home and in the classroom.

“America’s children are in crisis,” said Annie E Casey Foundation President and CEO Lisa Hamilton. “All across the country, families with children are struggling to overcome an unprecedented convergence of emergencies. We need immediate and decisive action from policymakers that prioritizes equitable solutions to help families survive this catastrophe.”

When the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Revere HealthCare Center opened its therapeutic food pantry in January 2020, the plan was to start off with a three-month, 10-patient pilot program. The pantry would provide plenty of plant-based, healthy food to the patients, all of whom had nutrition-dependent chronic diseases, like diabetes and obesity, and were food insecure, meaning they lacked enough food to live a healthy and active life.

“Of course, then COVID hit,” says Jacob Mirsky, MD, a primary care physician at MGH Revere and the food pantry’s medical director.

The number of community members in the Boston area struggling to access nutritious food jumped in March as the measures put in place to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic hit them economically. Mirsky and his team decided to rehaul the entire operation and expand service to every patient treated at the center and their families.

With funding from MGH Revere and partnerships with local food nonprofits, the pantry grew from operating out of a closet to filling a 1,000-square-foot storage space and feeding up to 80 patients and their families each week.

Food insecurity across the country has risen significantly since the pandemic sidelined 14 million workers in the United States from February to May, according to the Pew Research Center.

Feeding America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States, estimates that 17 million people in the country could become food insecure because of the pandemic, bringing the total to more than 54 million people in the country, including 18 million children. Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

Since food insecurity and poor nutrition are associated with several chronic illnesses that put people at higher risk for the more severe complications of COVID-19, the food access crisis threatens to exacerbate the already glaring disparities in health outcomes for vulnerable people, including low-income people, children, older adults, and immigrants living in the United States illegally.

“Though the factors underlying racial and ethnic disparities in Covid-19 in the United States are multifaceted and complex, long-standing disparities in nutrition and obesity play a crucial role in the health inequities unfolding during the pandemic,” writes a cohort of physicians and researchers in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September. “A healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and calorie-dense processed foods, is essential to health. The ability to eat a healthy diet is largely determined by one’s access to affordable, healthy foods — a consequence of the conditions and environment in which one lives.”

Mirsky believes that it is incumbent upon the health care system, and particularly academic medical centers, to take on a greater role in educating and connecting patients to healthy and tasty foods — and consequently reduce the prevalence of nutrition-related illnesses.

“We’re now living in a world where it is abundantly clear that the power of doctors and medical students and trainees expands beyond the walls of a health care setting,” Mirsky says. “Building these types of solutions [that address social determinants of health] is just as important — if not more important — than prescribing them medicine.”

Food is medicine

Over the past decade, a growing body of research has linked poor nutrition to poor health outcomes, particularly in patients with chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. This can stem from not only a lack of food but also an excess of unhealthy food that can cause obesity and contribute to other health problems. For many, this could be because they live in a food desert, where there are no grocery stores within a mile of their home, or because unhealthy food may be cheaper and easier to access.

The research has birthed a movement known as “Food is Medicine,” where physicians, nutrition experts, and policymakers encourage the use of programs that provide medically-tailored food to prevent and treat serious illnesses in patients, as opposed to relying solely on pharmaceuticals and other health care interventions.

“Food is really critically important for many of the diseases that are plaguing our country and the world,” Mirsky says.

A report published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2017 found that food insecurity was associated with 10 of the costliest and most deadly preventable diseases in the country, including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.

Conversely, a healthier diet, particularly one that focuses on plant-based meals, has been associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases, depression, and decreased mental function.

Barriers to access

But for millions of people in the United States, eating enough nutritious food is far easier said than done. Certain groups living in the United States face additional barriers and risks when it comes to nutrition and health, particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Children: Nearly 30 million children in the United States qualified for free or reduced-cost lunches at school in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated food insecurity among children, as the estimated number of food-insecure kids could jump from 11 million to an estimated 18 million, according to Feeding America. While many schools have continued to provide meals to children in need and food banks and pantries have amped up services, the disruption could have concerning long-term consequences. Studies have linked food insecurity in children to poor health, stunted development, behavioral issues, and difficulty keeping up in school, according to Feeding America.

Older adults: Seniors, generally defined as people age 65 and older, are at increased risk of the more severe complications that come with COVID-19. Consequently, those who live on low and fixed incomes face greater barriers to accessing adequate nutrition. This can, in turn, further increase their vulnerability to poor health outcomes.

“A lot of older adults, unfortunately, don’t have a generous retirement income,” explains David Buys, PhD, MSPH, an associate professor at Mississippi State University Extension and College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who has studied food insecurity in older adults. “They might be living on nothing but Social Security. Some might not have Social Security. We know that we have an increasing number of grandparents raising grandchildren … that can be a challenge.”

Buys says that older adults who are frail or lack transportation may struggle to get to the grocery store or to a food pantry — and that some are afraid to go out and risk exposing themselves to infection.

Food banks, food pantries, and other community outreach organizations have had to be creative in ways that they serve older adults since the pandemic hit, such as delivering food to their homes, drawing on long-standing programs like Meals on Wheels, Buys says.

One study from before the pandemic found that, in a group of older adults discharged from the hospital, those seniors that received meals delivered by Meals on Wheels had lower rates of hospital readmission in three and six months than expected.

Providing healthy meals can be a key to keeping older adults healthy and out of the hospital or congregate health care situations that might increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. It’s an issue of particular concern since more than 84% of people over the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition and many face economic hardship as a result of medical debt, according to the National Council on Aging.

Immigrants in the United States illegally: While Latino communities in the United States in general have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, immigrants in the country without legal permission — many of whom are Latino — are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity because they are not eligible for many government relief programs. Even before the pandemic, 1 in 4 experienced food insecurity, according to a 2016 report by Bread for the World, a nonprofit dedicated to ending hunger.

While Medicaid programs in some states, including California and Massachusetts, are beginning to cover the cost of programs that provide food to patients, people living in the country illegally are not eligible for Medicaid. Nor are they eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, nor the $1,200 stimulus check that the federal government approved earlier this year.

“We see a movement right now to integrate more food and nutrition services into health care delivery and financing,” explains Sarah Downer, JD, associate director of whole person care at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School. “But every gap that we have is a place where undocumented immigrants fall into that gap.”

Instead, many rely on local food pantries for aid, which were stretched thin early in the pandemic while trying to accommodate millions of new clients, says David Velasquez, a fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School who is also pursuing a master of business administration at Harvard Business School and a master in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.

“Food is a basic human need. And it’s something that we all deserve.” David Velasquez

Fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School

Velasquez, who experienced food insecurity himself as the child of Nicaraguan parents who originally came to the United States illegally before being granted asylum, decided during the early months of the pandemic to research policies that could support food access for immigrants during this crisis.

He teamed up with another Harvard medical student, Jordan Kondo, and two attorneys from the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, Downer and Emily Broad Lieb, JD, to write a journal article that argued for policies that could help bring relief to immigrants who aren’t eligible for much government aid.

For example, they said the government should make it a priority to fund emergency food services programs that are accessible to those living in the country illegally, such as food banks and community health centers, and that health systems should ensure that they are not excluded from programs that integrate nutrition into health care delivery.

“Food is a basic human need,” Velasquez says. “And it’s something that we all deserve.”

Facing a long-term problem

When Mirsky was crafting the model for MGH Revere’s therapeutic food pantry, it was important to him that the pantry provide not only nutritious food but also the means to enjoy it.

Patients who visited the pantry initially received pots and pans, a spatula, oil, spices, and consultations with a nutritionist who could help them come up with recipes that they enjoy. The goal is to foster self-motivated healthy lifestyles. When the pantry expanded to a greater number of patients due to the pandemic, they could no longer offer all these services, but they hope to reintroduce them in the future.

“Food and eating are an essential part of the human experience,” Mirsky says. “Cooking and enjoying healthy food is a very powerful and respectful way of improving someone’s life.”

The MGH Revere pantry in the Boston area is just one of many nutrition outreach programs that health care providers across the country have increasingly implemented in recent years, as the American Hospital Association highlights in its social determinants of health report series. More health care providers are screening for food insecurity regularly and helping connect their patients to resources.

Still, food insecurity persisted before the pandemic, and the pandemic has further stretched existing community resources, as NPR reported in September.

Mirsky notes that the pantry at MGH Revere is already feeling the strain and is leading an effort to raise funds for a permanent location for the pantry. He’s also concerned about how much food they will be able to acquire in the winter, when there will be less local produce available and as renewed COVID-19 surges threaten to further stress systems.

“Our goal is to recognize that this is a very long-term problem that is going to require a long-term solution.”","Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A senior scientist from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture presents research on gender equity in global aquaculture and fishery industries next week at Mississippi State.

On Thursday [Feb. 6], Steven Cole is discussing “Gender dynamics in small-scale fisheries and aquaculture” at 9:30 a.m. in the Colvard Student Union’s Fowlkes Auditorium. The event is free to all and sponsored by the MSU-based Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, or Fish Innovation Lab, and the university’s Social Science Research Center.

The Fish Innovation Lab is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and part of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for global populations dependent on aquaculture- and fisheries-led economies. MSU leads the lab through its Global Center for Aquatic Food Security, directed by Mark Lawrence, professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

Cole’s presentation will highlight the dynamics that shape women’s participation in aquaculture and fishery industries, as well as the benefits derived from them. He will discuss the increase in gender research, the knowledge gaps that remain, and how filling these gaps is important to enhancing food, nutrition and economic security of people with low incomes.

“We are fortunate to have Dr. Cole visit MSU to share his knowledge on this topic,” said Lawrence. “His expertise in the relationships between gender, agriculture, and food, nutrition and economic security will be of interest to researchers and technicians in a variety of fields.”

As a gender specialist with the IITA, Cole is based in the Eastern Africa Hub in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He employs a mixed methodology in his research and works collaboratively with biophysical scientists to ensure that agriculture research for development has greater impact. He has led the social science research for WorldFish in Zambia for the past six years, integrating gender and other social science perspectives in aquaculture, small-scale fisheries, value chains and nutrition research.

Cole obtained his Ph.D. in biological anthropology from the University of Arizona in 2012. He also holds a master’s degree in agricultural and resource economics and a bachelor’s in health and nutrition.

USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Tuesday that SNAP would be funded through February, thanks to the funding bill that expired on Dec. 22, which included a provision allowing federal agencies to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date.

In September 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in SNAP benefits were disbursed throughout every state. If the shutdown continues through March, there will be no remaining funding for SNAP, endangering food security for millions of Americans.

According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 42 million Americans received SNAP benefits in 2017. More than 68 percent of participants were in families with children, and more than 44 percent were in working families.

Other programs were in even more immediate danger than SNAP. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) were not receiving federal funds at all during the shutdown, but ""can continue to operate at the State and local level with any funding and commodity resources that remain available,"" according to the USDA in December.

However, the USDA announced Tuesday that WIC would continue to operate through February, thanks to ""prior year funding which USDA will begin to provide states this week.""

In the first five months of 2018, around 7 million Americans received WIC benefits each month. WIC is provided for pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who fall within the poverty index and are at ""nutritional risk."" The WIC program granted nearly $5 billion to every U.S. state and territory in 2018, as of September.

Americans who benefit from both SNAP and WIC would be particularly affected if the shutdown continues past February.

Child Nutrition Programs, including School Lunch, School Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Feeding, Summer Food Service and Special Milk will continue operations through February, according to the USDA.

Staffing for Food and Nutrition Services, which oversees the Child Nutrition Programs, SNAP, and WIC, has been cut by 95 percent since the shutdown began.","In September 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in SNAP benefits were disbursed throughout every state.

76,"Nov 17, 2020",Ole Miss News,Grove Grocery is Students Helping Students,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s food pantry is now known as Grove Grocery and though the name is different, its student-led fight against hunger and the stigma around food insecurity continues.

Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213. Workers wear masks and follow all campus protocols while they serve students. It’s open 3-8 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays and noon to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.

It’s exciting to see the organization grow to be able to help more students, and also help them in new ways, said Chloe Grant, Grove Grocery director and a senior biology major from St. Louis.

“One of my main goals as the food pantry’s director is to help de-stigmatize food insecurity and to help people feel more comfortable with getting the resources they deserve,” Grant said. “I think many students, faculty and staff don’t use the food pantry because they’re embarrassed or because they feel like they aren’t needy enough.

“However, we want everyone to know that we’re here to help them – without judgement – so that they can focus on what really matters in life.”

Grove Grocery has received a $10,000 donation from Kroger, which is part of a new and continuing partnership. Company representatives visited Grove Grocery recently and recorded video interviews with Ole Miss students to share with Kroger employees across the Delta region.

There’s also an Ignite campaign to benefit the pantry and help it to serve as many students and others as possible.

Many people find themselves struggling financially during the ongoing pandemic, said Kate Forster, staff adviser for Grove Grocery. Usage has gone up, including an increased need for hygiene products and other personal items, she said.

“Our utilization has gone up,” Forster said. “It has brought a spotlight to the work of Grove Grocery, and the needs on campus. We would think that on a campus like this and in a place so rich with resources, students would never go hungry. Still, many students are facing very difficult monthly decisions.

“We always want to raise awareness about our services in a de-stigmatizing way. We really try to remove as many barriers as possible to students and employees finding what they need.”

Here’s a full list of Grove Grocery’s services.

While usage has gone up, donations have increased, as well. Forster believes many people find themselves wanting to help others during COVID. She said its rewarding to see the work at Grove Grocery is both student-led and heavily supported by students.

“One in three college students during their undergraduate years will experience food insecurity,” Forster said. “This semester, we’ve given out over 1,800 meals and more than 700 meal swipes.

“We are in a good place to support the community’s needs, and we want to raise awareness. There is a lot of good happening here.”

The pantry takes feedback from clients about their needs, and collects those items. They’ve also partnered to provide “meal swipes” on student and employee ID cards. Those who need swipes can apply here.

Grove Grocery is a good way to help those in need, especially now, said Kieran Murphy, assistant director and a junior management major from Ocean Springs.

“We have so many important goals and ideas we try to implement so that we can ensure the most people get the help they need,” Murphy said. “I am very humbled and honored to serve in a role that allows me to feel that I’m making a difference in people’s lives, and it will always be an experience I will remember and cherish.”

Mary Beth Gillespie, another Grove Grocery assistant director and a senior biology major from Brandon, said she first heard of the pantry as a sophomore. It’s become a “passion project” for her because it helps so many, she said.

“Working with the food pantry has not only impacted my time at Ole Miss, but it has also shaped my outlook on my future and how I would like to continue to combat food insecurity as someone pursuing a career in dentistry,” Gillespie said. “The food pantry is continuing to grow and expand, and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store.”","Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213.

77,"Nov 11, 2020",The New York Times,Somebody’s Watching: Hackers Breach Ring Home Security Cameras,"“Our security team has investigated this incident and we have no evidence of an unauthorized intrusion or compromise of Ring’s systems or network,” the statement said. “Recently, we were made aware of an incident where malicious actors obtained some Ring users’ account credentials (e.g., user name and password) from a separate, external, non-Ring service and reused them to log in to some Ring accounts.”

Ring users can monitor the cameras on the company’s smartphone app and speak to people inside their home and at their front door using a two-way audio feature. But cybersecurity experts say all it takes is a user name and password for hackers to gain access to the devices.

Ring said it began sending emails this weekend to its millions of customers, reminding them to use multifactor authentication, which requires users to verify their identity by entering a code that they receive as a text message or by using an authentication application, in addition to their password.

“Unfortunately, when the same user name and password is reused on multiple services, it’s possible for bad actors to gain access to many accounts,” the statement said.

A spokesman for the Jackson, Miss., field office of the F.B.I. said he could not confirm or deny that the episode was being investigated. The Southaven police chief, Macon Moore, said on Monday that the case was under investigation, but would not comment further because the investigation was active. He also said that the police had not received other reports.

Cybersecurity experts said it’s not that difficult for hackers to gain access to “internet of things” devices, which include Ring security cameras and voice assistants, such as Alexa and Google Home.

“Unfortunately, we’re so reliant on passwords at this point, but passwords are absolutely the weakest link,” said Tim Weber, security services director for ADNET Technologies in Farmington, Conn.","“Our security team has investigated this incident and we have no evidence of an unauthorized intrusion or compromise of Ring’s systems or network,” the statement said.

Editor’s note: This article will be continually updated throughout the COVID-19 outbreak and will remain in alphabetical order. Please email elena@foodtank.com if you would like to add an opportunity to our running list.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus, has disrupted most of the world in recent weeks. People are staying home from work, schools and colleges are moving online, and restaurants in many cities and states are mandated to serve eaters via takeout or delivery only. Farmers markets are closing or not opening at all. And, unfortunately, some cafes, bars, and kitchens have closed entirely. Food service workers—from chefs and line cooks to wait staff and dishwashers—are on the front lines of both the health and economic impacts of this disease.

But thankfully, in response, advocates around the country and around the world are gathering community support—and if you’re able, you can help too. These organizations are welcoming donations of food, money, and volunteer hours to aid restaurants, service workers, farmers, and people going hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. ALONE Ireland

With people self-isolating to prevent COVID-19 infections, senior citizens—already particularly vulnerable to the disease—may feel lonelier with limited social contact. ALONE is an Irish organization that recruits volunteers to call, visit, and befriend elderly people living at home. In response to COVID-19, they are looking for more volunteers to offer telephone support, by kindly checking in on those over 60, and practical support, by running errands like grocery shopping and pharmacy pickups. They have also launched a national helpline to answer questions and offer reassurance. People around the world are welcome to donate, and those living in Ireland can volunteer here.

2. ATL Family Meal

As a collaboration of more than 200 restaurants and businesses in the Atlanta area, ATL Family Meal delivers meals to hospitality workers who are facing either unemployment or hunger due to COVID-19. ATL Family Meal has delivered more than 15,000 meals during the pandemic. The initiative’s meal delivery network includes Butcher & Brew, Holeman & Finch, Empire State South, and more. Plus, Wild Heaven Beer, a local craft beer brewery, has created two new beers to support ATL Family Meal and is donating a portion of proceeds to the initiative.

3. Big Table

Operating in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and San Diego, California, Big Table cares for restaurant workers experiencing hardship, poverty, addiction, legal trouble, and more—all of which can be magnified by crises like COVID-19. Big Table works on a referral model, so rather than requiring a person in crisis to ask, Big Table allows a fellow employee or manager to submit a personal referral. You can donate online, or care for vulnerable members of your own community by taking on one of Big Table’s creative support ideas. If you are a food service worker and know someone in crisis, refer them here.

4. Boston Cares

A central hub for volunteering, Boston Cares helps more than 25,000 people annually give back to schools, nonprofit agencies, and other community programs. They recruit, train, and mobilize volunteers across the Greater Boston area. As many civic organizations adjust their programming models in response to COVID-19, Boston Cares is seeking volunteers to help the community. Boston Cares offers a virtual volunteer orientation program so people can begin to help others while maintaining their social distancing.

5. California Food Policy Advocates

With offices in Oakland, Los Angeles, and San Diego, California Food Policy Advocates (CFPA) pushes policy solutions to help low-income people across the state access healthy food. CFPA supported and will help implement national COVID-19 response programs in California, including those enacted by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. CFPA is also using its email newsletter as a way to keep the community informed about advocacy opportunities and policy responses to the coronavirus. You can donate here.

6. Chef Ann Foundation

The Chef Ann Foundation is a Colorado-based nonprofit helping schools around the country serve kids healthier, tastier, scratch-made lunches. As schools respond to coronavirus-related closures, the Chef Ann Foundation is sharing successful tactics and best practices from their partner districts. They’re working to make it as easy as possible to develop remote food programs and other support for students. In addition to accepting donations, the Chef Ann Foundation is also collecting messages for a nationwide Thank You card for school food workers across America.

7. Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE)

Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE) offers support to families of food and beverage service workers facing serious challenges, from serious illness and death to injury or eviction. CORE grants help families with everything they need to weather tough times — medical bills, gas, groceries, clothing, utilities, rent, and more. Since 2004, CORE has supported more than 600 families and raised over $4 million. Currently, CORE is setting aside grants specifically for families of restaurant employees who have tested positive for COVID-19.

8. City Harvest

As restaurants closed and events were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, much of the food that would have been served did not go to waste, thanks to City Harvest. The New York City-based food rescue organization received 50,000 pounds of donated food last week — five times their normal intake — and distributed it to food pantries, soup kitchens, and directly to families in need. Monetary donations to City Harvest will help provide more shelf-stable food relief to people in need and ensure their delivery schedule can meet the increased need.

9. Dining at a Distance

Dining at a Distance, created specifically to support food providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers dozens of local, community-sourced databases of farms and restaurants that remain open for business. Residents of nearly 50 cities of all sizes around the globe, from Berlin to Boston to Corinth, Mississippi, can find contact information for restaurants, takeout and delivery details, and comments from community members. Dining at a Distance also offers databases of farms in all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C., broken down by crop type, organic certification, and how consumers can pick up or receive fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, and more. You can get involved by adding restaurants and farms to the database or starting a new database if your city isn’t listed.

10. Family Agriculture Resource Management Services (F.A.R.M.S.)

Recognizing the systemic challenges and discrimination Black farmers face in the United States, attorney Jillian Hishaw founded Family Agriculture Resource Management Services. F.A.R.M.S. provides legal assistance to farmers with limited resources and helps them retain control and ownership of their land. The Farmers Emergency Fund, which is open to small rural farmers, but not farm employees, is aimed at making sure aging farmers and those from historically disadvantaged groups can stay afloat during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Stipends are limited to $500.

11. The Farmer Fund

Although The Farmer Fund was initially founded to help Georgia farmers facing destruction from natural disasters, “we have seen over the past few days that a pandemic like COVID-19 is its own natural disaster — and is certainly an emergency,” they write. The Farmer Fund, now run by Georgia Organics, has raised over US$50,000 to support farmers in the state since 2018. Now, donations to the fund will help farmers survive the pandemic, rebuild, and continue feeding Georgians through markets, CSAs, and restaurant sales.

12. Farmworker Justice

Through legal advocacy in government, regulatory agencies, and in the court system, Farmworker Justice aims to secure legal rights for agricultural workers and improve their working conditions. With dedicated attorneys on staff, Farmworker Justice represents agricultural workers in lawsuits and regulatory petitions. At the same time, they educate both policymakers and the public about the challenges they face. “All of these workers are in perilous situations and being given absolutely no respect in the narrative of COVID-19,” food activist and journalist Raj Patel told me on Food Talk with Dani Nierenberg.”

13. Feed the Front Line NOLA

In three steps, Feed the Front Line supports restaurants, musicians and artists, and hospital workers caring for those impacted by COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana. First, every donation goes toward ordering meals from local restaurants for ER shift crews. Second, local musicians and artists who have lost out on gigs are hired to pick up the food and deliver it to a local hospital. Third, the talented deliverers drop off the food with a side of morale-boosting “food love.” During the last week of March, Feed the Front Line NOLA fed 1,200 hospital workers with 35 deliveries, putting $10,000 toward local restaurants, musicians, and artists. On Saturday, April 4, alone, they served 1,800 meals. If you want to “send food love,” you can donate online.

14. Float Small Business & Portland Community SOS

Float Small Business and Portland Community SOS are two initiatives in Portland, OR, with similar missions: encouraging community members to support local businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Float Small Business has pages devoted to restaurants & bars, cafes, and grocers & specialty shops, with links to support funds so you can give money directly to restaurants struggling to survive. Portland Community SOS is focused on gift cards, and offers links to the websites of restaurants and cafes that offer them. Portland Community SOS also offers a page of resources for business owners.

15. Food Chain Workers Alliance

By uniting worker-based organizations into a broad coalition, the Food Chain Workers Alliance (FCWA) stands up for more than 375,000 workers who “plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, [by] organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain.” In a survey, the Food Chain Workers Alliance found that 80 percent of all food workers were not given paid sick days, and 43 percent said they feared they would lose their job if they took a sick day. In response to the dangers of COVID-19, the Food Chain Workers Alliance is fighting for the health and safety of workers, fair wages and working conditions, and support for street vendors and undocumented immigrants.

16. Food Recovery Network

Since its inception in 2011, Food Recovery Network has rescued more than 3.2 million pounds of food and has a presence on 230 college campuses across the United States. Food Recovery Network empowers students, communities, and food businesses to reconstruct their perceptions and habits around surplus food. To support businesses making difficult choices in closing or paring down operations, FRN has created a four-step COVID-19 Food Recovery Guide to make donating excess food as simple as possible.

17. Frontline Foods

Hospital workers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, often working day and night treating patients. Meanwhile, local restaurants are struggling financially. Frontline Foods aims to address both issues: With donations processed through Chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen, Frontline Foods pays local restaurants to cook and deliver meals to hospital workers in their community. With 28 chapters in 21 U.S. states, Frontline Foods has raised over US$1 million and delivered more than 7,000 meals during the COVID-19 outbreak. You can donate through World Central Kitchen here or sign up as a volunteer.

18. Gift Card Army

Based in Portland, OR, Gift Card Army offers a searchable directory of local restaurants, cafes, bars, and other retail shops that remain open for delivery, takeout, or—as the name suggests—gift cards, which can help a small business stay afloat during COVID-19 even if they suspend kitchen operations. Gift Card Army allows you to search for restaurants in the Portland area geographically as well, and a map-based search function is under development. If you operate a small business, you can enter your info into the search engine here.

19. Good Farmer Fund

A project of the Seattle Neighborhood Farmers Markets, the Good Farmer Fund assists small and new farms facing any sort of crisis—extreme weather, fire, equipment damage, flood, predators, and more. Margins for farms can be razor-thin, and the Good Farmer Fund has given more than US$280,000 to over 80 farms since 2008 to help them land on their feet. As markets shut down and demand drops due to COVID-19, the Good Farmer Fund will be issuing several round of grants over the next few months. They accept donations to the fund and applications for grants on their website.

20. Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen

Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen is New York City’s largest emergency food-relief organization. In addition to their soup kitchen, their Backpack Pantry Program helps ensure that school-aged kids in NYC—one in ten of whom lived in a homeless shelter at some point last year—have food to eat.

The Center is currently working to release Coronavirus NYC Food Resource Guides for each of NYC’s 59 neighborhoods with the following information: meals for children, meals for seniors, retail food stores and their delivery/benefits policies, local food pantries and soup kitchens, resources for homeless people, resources for immigrant populations, and resources for people with disabilities.

22. Italian Red Cross

Italy has been particularly affected by the coronavirus, with more COVID-19 cases and deaths than almost any other country. The Italian Red Cross (CRI) is working with the Italian Ministry of Health to manage the country’s response. CRI is helping set up special treatment structures and transporting potentially infected patients using biocontaminant vehicles. Additionally, they are supplying regional Italian Red Cross committees with testing and treatment materials. People around the world can donate to support the Italian Red Cross’ efforts, and if you live in Italy, you can sign up and train to volunteer online.

23. James Beard Foundation

The James Beard Foundation’s mission is to celebrate America’s food culture. At a time when restaurants, bars, and other independent food and beverage operations are facing temporary closures and reduced capacity, their futures may feel uncertain. To combat this financial strain, the Foundation launched the James Beard Foundation Food and Beverage Relief Fund. Donations will be used to provide micro-grants to independent businesses in need.

24. Little Tokyo Community Feeding Community Program

The Los Angeles neighborhood of Little Tokyo is the most populous Japantown district in the U.S. and, like much of the country, has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. The Community Feeding Community program is providing meals from small businesses in Little Tokyo and the Arts District to hospitality workers whose jobs were affected by COVID-19. The Community Feeding Community program is purchasing meals at full price to support businesses that remain open and, thanks to more than US$20,000 in community donations, is able to offer them for free pickup every Wednesday and Saturday at 5 p.m. You can donate online in US$15 increments.

25. Meals on Wheels

Meals on Wheels provides food, companionship, and safety checks for 2.4 million senior citizens across the U.S. While requests for service have increased amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many of Meals on Wheels’ clients—and older volunteers—are among the most vulnerable to the disease. Meals on Wheels America has begun a nationwide COVID-19 Response Fund, and many local providers—from Portland, OR, to Minneapolis, MN, to the Sarasota, FL, area—are also accepting donations and asking for younger, healthy community members to volunteer.

26. Miriam’s Kitchen

Since 1983, Miriam’s Kitchen has worked to address homelessness in Washington, D.C. In addition to serving meals, they also connect people with nurses, social workers, lawyers, and other advocates to help end homelessness in the long term—not simply respond to it. Many people experiencing homelessness are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19, so although Miriam’s Kitchen temporarily suspended its volunteer program for their safety, the organization is ramping up its outreach program to provide support to guests wherever they are.

27. National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON)

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) works to secure civil and political rights for low-wage workers and day laborers, or those who are hired and paid day-to-day. In its Worker & Migrant Justice Response to Coronavirus, NDLON condemned the “unprecedented levels of nativism, xenophobia, racial resentment, and dehumanization” made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. They call for providing medical treatment for all, releasing those in immigrant detention camps, and stopping deportations so all U.S. government resources can be put toward an “‘all hands on deck’ social effort.”

28. No Kid Hungry

As schools close in response to COVID-19, many children who rely on school lunch lose their only source of nutritious, high-quality meals. In response, No Kid Hungry has launched a multimillion-dollar campaign, including releasing US$1 million in immediate grants for school districts and nonprofit organizations to continue meals programs. Donations to No Kid Hungry also provide resources to families in need and support outreach efforts, so they know how to find meals during school closures.

29. Nourish Your Neighbors and #EatStrongRI

Nourish Your Neighbors is providing hundreds of meals per week to families and seniors across Rhode Island. The program is run by Hope & Main, an entrepreneurial incubator program aimed at supporting the local food economy, and you can donate online. They have also started a campaign called #EatStrongRI, to rally people around the necessity of shopping locally during COVID-19. Their webpage provides resources to make it easy to support the local food system: You can find apps that let you shop directly from Rhode Island farmers, independent restaurants offering takeout and delivery, and information about their weekly What’s Local Wednesdays pop-up takeout series. Hope & Main also invites you to share how you’re supporting your local food producers by using #EatStrongRI.

30. On The Line

On The Line is paying local restaurants in Westchester County, New York, to make meals for vulnerable community members. Nearly 20 restaurants are participating in the project, preparing meals to be served to food-insecure kids, senior citizens, immunocompromised or newly unemployed people, and those whose housing is not stable. As of the first week of May, On The Line has distributed 8,000 meals, and has been able to support restaurant staff and food purveyors by paying US$5 per meal. On The Line and is currently fundraising with the goal of paying restaurants US$7 per meal and feeding 4,000 more over the next two weeks. Donations are accepted online.

31. One Fair Wage

Advocates at One Fair Wage are working to end the tipped minimum wage, a practice in the U.S. that allows employers to pay workers significantly less than the legal minimum wage if they also earn tips. With many restaurants across the country closing or reducing service—and sectors such as ridesharing and nail/hair salons also significantly affected—One Fair Wage has launched an Emergency Coronavirus Tipped and Service Worker Support Fund. This effort will provide restaurant workers, Lyft/Uber drivers, and other tipped wage-earners with money they need for basic expenses, like food and rent.

32. The Power of 10

A new initiative that launched in response to COVID-19, The Power of 10 is a “restaurant revitalization plan” conceived by chef Erik Bruner-Yang. The Power of 10 aims to use one donation to fund restaurants, support employees, and feed food-insecure communities for free. If a restaurant could receive a $10,000 donation, it could re-employ 10 full-time staff and serve 1,000 free meals — hence, the power of 10. The initiative is being piloted at three restaurants in Washington, D.C.: Cane, ABC Pony, and Maketto, which is helmed by Bruner-Yang. The model is coming to Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, and is scalable for any size community across the country. You can make donations in amounts that are, appropriately, powers of 10, starting at US$10.

33. Philly Restaurant Relief & Server Relief Fund

Restaurants in Philadelphia, like in many cities across the world, are subject to restrictions on dining-in due to COVID-19. To allow community members to continue supporting restaurants, the website Philly Restaurant Relief encourages people to pay their “check” in the form of a donation or gift card in the amount they might otherwise have spent on the meal. Philadelphia restaurant workers are also supported by the unrelated Philly Restaurant Server Relief Fund. This initiative aims to raise enough money to give servers $400 a week, the average they would otherwise earn, until at least the beginning of April.

34. Provision Community Restaurant

Provision Community Restaurant is the first pay-as-you-can restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Typically, they invite all community members for family-style dinners and Saturday brunches, which is not currently possible because of dine-in restrictions due to COVID-19. As restaurants shifted their operations, many donated excess food to Provision. Now, twice every weekday, Provision is offering free, single-serve take-out dinners to anyone who needs it. They are still accepting donations of food and money to support the community.

35. Relief International

Relief International operates in 16 countries across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, where they provide medical aid and help with development in “fragile settings.” One of Relief International’s focus countries, Iran, has one of the highest COVID-19 infection and death numbers in the world. In response, the organization is raising money to provide medical supplies for medical professionals there. According to Relief International, a US$15 donation can fully stock one facility in Iran with hand sanitizer, gloves, and protective eyewear, and a US$75 donation can treat two COVID-19-positive patients.

36. Relief Opportunities for All Restaurants (ROAR) New York

Over 50 of New York City’s eateries and restaurant groups—including influential names such as Daniel Boulud’s Dinex Group, David Chang’s Momofuku Group, and Tom Colicchio’s Crafted Hospitality—have come together to form Relief Opportunities for All Restaurants (ROAR). In partnership with New York anti-poverty organization Robin Hood, ROAR has launched a restaurant employee relief fund. The fund, operating on a first-come-first-served basis, will give grants of US$500 to help food-service workers cover expenses such as rent, food, medicine, child care, and more.

37. Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United

Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United provides support, training, and advocacy for restaurant workers across the U.S. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, ROC United has supported employees at major corporate restaurant groups in demanding paid sick days and has launched a media campaign to encourage restaurant workers to share their stories with newspapers. ROC United has compiled a guide to both national and city/state-specific resources for restaurant workers affected by COVID-19, from emergency grant funds to food banks to unemployment agencies. ROC United is also accepting direct donations to their Restaurant Worker Disaster Relief Fund.

38. Rethink Food NYC

Rethink Food NYC, an organization that seeks to recover and distribute food in New York City, is ramping up its anti-hunger efforts amid COVID-19. As part of their Emergency Food Response program, Rethink Food NYC is hiring temporary paid employees to work as on the culinary team, cafe team, facilities team, and distribution. Additionally, they are seeking volunteers to help package to-go meals—their goal of 15,000 meals a day will help ensure every New Yorker has access to food, wherever they are. Rethink Food NYC is also supporting restaurants. Thirty restaurants will be selected to receive US$40,000 grants to stay up and running as meal distribution centers during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping secure food for those in need and jobs for service employees. They are accepting monetary donations here.

79,"Nov 25, 2019",Southern Miss Now,USM’s Gulf Park Campus Supports Coastal Families Through Golden Basket,"USM’s Gulf Park Campus Supports Coastal Families Through Golden Basket

Mon, 11/25/2019 - 16:42pm | By: Jenny Tate

Making spirits bright – along with filling bellies with food, homes with needed items, and hearts with joy – is part of the goal of University of Southern Mississippi (USM) Gulf Park campus students, faculty and staff each November through the annual Golden Basket project.

Led by USM Gulf Park students in the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) Club, the Thanksgiving Golden Basket project supports South Mississippi families who are among the least food secure on the coast. This year, 10 families were pre-screened and selected from the Bay-Waveland, Long Beach, and Harrison County school districts and the Jackson County Head Start.

Teams consisting of USM students, faculty and staff ‘adopt’ a family and provide all of the items for a Thanksgiving dinner, as well as holiday presents and other basic items for their designated family, such as furniture, clothing, shoes and personal hygiene items.

The project began in 2011, when a student in the USM social work program working at a local Head Start agency saw a need to provide a Thanksgiving meal to a family who lacked food security. In 2012, social work instructor Karen Aderer formalized the project, leading each of the four cohorts of students – pre-social work, juniors, seniors and master’s students, as well as the social work faculty – to each adopt a family. In 2017, Dr. Casey Maugh Funderburk, vice provost for the Gulf Park campus, helped expand the project campus-wide.

Aderer has also integrated the service project into a meaningful out of the classroom learning experience for her students.

“From an educational standpoint, this event represents the service learning component that we think is so important to offer to our students. It is one thing to learn about something in a book; it is quite another to have to go out and actually carry out the critical thinking and work involved,” said Aderer, who serves at the BSW Club advisor. “My social work students get real world experience in interviewing families and then acting as the liaisons between the family and the team that adopts them.”

Students had the opportunity to interview families selected for Golden Basket, giving students like Tiffany Cole valuable hands-on field experience. Cole, a senior Social Work major and President of the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) Club, helped lead this year’s Golden Basket project.

“I was the leader for the Bachelor of Social Work Club team. I made a lot of calls and going around to different companies simply asking for donations for the family. Advocacy is a big part of social work and it felt really good to really advocate for this family. I also had to stay in contact with the other officers of the BSW Club to make sure that all of the family’s needs were being supplied,” said Cole.

Families who are selected to receive Golden Baskets not only have food insecurity, but may have experienced a recent adverse life event such as loss of job, eviction or a house fire. They may also be behind on bills and/or lack reliable transportation.

Cole was also able to obtain that hands-on field experience by interviewing two of the 2019 Golden Basket families.

“I had the opportunity to interview two families selected for Golden Baskets this year. This interviewing process was a time for the family to discuss their needs and wants, but both of my families even wanted to discuss what led them to their situation,” said Cole.

“As a social work major, we learn about the Ecological Theory, that a person’s environment and surroundings have effects on that person. This actually brought what I learned in class into perspective, the ‘real world’ experience. After discussing the family’s situation, needs and wants, the family expressed their gratitude for all of the assistance,” she added.

In addition to acquiring hands-on field experience, Cole said the project made her step out of her comfort zone to ask for donations for her team’s family by reaching out to local businesses and individuals.

“I was able to communicate and reach out to different organizations and individuals to advocate for the family’s desires. This experience taught me that there are a lot of people in the world willing to assist, we just need to ask for the assistance,” said Cole.

Aderer attributes the success of the annual holiday event to working in a team environment.

“To pull off a philanthropic event like this, our faculty, staff and students have to pull together to plan, problem solve, assign tasks, divvy up donation seeking, and strategize set up and delivery. All of this is very team-building and ability-enhancing. It also shows our students the importance of giving back and helping to create a better community,” said Aderer.

As part of the annual project, Golden Basket items are gathered and staged in the Hardy Hall Ballroom on the Gulf Park campus, where participating teams displayed their items prior to delivery. Team members then deliver the items to the receiving family, meeting them for the very first time.

“When delivering these items and seeing the family become excited because of spatulas or wallets, it caused me to become more grateful of the things that I am blessed to have,” added Cole.","USM’s Gulf Park Campus Supports Coastal Families Through Golden BasketMon, 11/25/2019 - 16:42pm | By: Jenny TateMaking spirits bright – along with filling bellies with food, homes with needed items, and hearts with joy – is part of the goal of University of Southern Mississippi (USM) Gulf Park campus students, faculty and staff each November through the annual Golden Basket project.

81,"Sep 16, 2020",Mississippi Today,‘In the midst of crisis and struggle…there’s still hope’ — Q&A with Delta nonprofit director Chiquikta Shaw,"Chiquikta Fountain, a Mississippi Delta native, is the executive director for Delta Hands for Hope in Shaw, Mississippi which is also in the Mississippi Delta. Fountain has spearheaded the organization’s pivot from offering youth after school and summer programming to also becoming a designated emergency food pantry once the pandemic hit.

Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length.

Mississippi Today: What do you do as director for Delta Hands for Hope?

Chiquikta Fountain: Our organization is focused on youth. We do a lot around education. We do after school programming, we also offer summer camps. We also focus on health and nutrition. An example of that would be our summer feeding program. Right now we’re actually operating as an emergency food pantry because of COVID. So we’re using our background in working with kids in that area to ensure that they’re still getting access to meals until school starts. So pretty much whatever the community needs, we try to serve in that capacity, but our main focus is youth.

Mississippi Today: Do you see yourself as an advocate as well as a community leader?

Fountain: I do. My background was in advocacy, particularly in education advocacy before I took this job last year. So one of the things that I really wanted to do when I came into this position was find ways to use that skill set as a director. And I just think it worked hand-in-hand. We have access to so many resources and we need to be using those resources to empower our youth and how they see themselves. I want to help give them the tools that they need to learn how to navigate the world whether they choose to leave Shaw or to live here in Shaw, to show them that they can still make change. They can still bring impact and also help their families. There’s no way that we can focus all of our efforts on supporting youth and just disregard the family unit. So whatever it is that we can do to bridge that gap, we’re looking to do that as well.

Mississippi Today: How have you seen your role as a community leader and advocate evolved through this pandemic and social reckoning that we’re happening?

Fountain: Even — There’s still optimism. I want to use my position and my point of view to show that yes, these things are happening in our area. We were dealing with these things far before we even knew what coronavirus and COVID-19 was. But I want to use these opportunities to talk about the great people that we have in our community. One of the things that I have seen since we’ve been doing this, particularly around food security in this area and operating as a food pantry, is people coming to help. These young people are coming every day. Every day that we have something going on they are here and they are committed from the time they showed up until the last box of food was gone and the last gallon of milk was gone. They give so selflessly so I am just so happy to see that.

A lot of those seeds were sown in this community and into these children long before I got here. So I can’t take credit for that, but what I do feel like I bring to the table is giving them a space to show them how not only will this be something great for them to put on their resumé, but this is an act of kindness that we need to exercise more of. We never know a person’s situation and what they’re going through when they get home. But if we can do something in our actions to make someone else’s day brighter or to give them something to eat that they didn’t have earlier, let’s do that. And this is also an opportunity for you to be the type of person that you want to be. So we don’t want to just talk about what leadership should look like. We need to be setting those examples, providing spaces for them to actually see that in motion.

Mississippi Today: It sounds like the example that you want to provide for the youth is really shaping the way you’re thinking about yourself as a leader.

Fountain: Absolutely. When I first came into this position, I didn’t think that I was ready, even with having a teenager for a child myself. I really didn’t know what to expect or how I should go about trying to connect with these young people. It was like the more I started to settle into the job I just realized, ‘You’re really overthinking this.’ Because what I’ve been able to see in the past is a lot of older people who were neglected, who didn’t have someone to pull them aside instill love and support and understanding and confidence into them. So now I have an opportunity to not take the place of these children’s parents by any means, but I’m an extension of that home and I have a chance to forge those things.

There are so many kids who I see that people just disregard because of their last name, because of where they’re from because they’ve got behavior issues but you never know why. And just because they have that last name, that’s not a predictor of who they are. It doesn’t mean they can’t be great. So I’m really trying to see this new phase of leadership as a way for me to not make them be what I think that they should be, but help them to see what they can’t see. It could be an opportunity to say, ‘You don’t have to leave Shaw to be great. There are things you can do right here as a young person.’

I also think it’s important that people see the face of the so-called leader and not this person that is delegating responsibilities to volunteers. Because I could easily just say, ‘OK volunteers you guys handle all of this and I’m going to be up at the office.’ No, they need to see me out there dirty, dusty, sweating. They need to see that because that means that I’m invested. I’m not out here because I want a pat on the back but because I need you all to see that I’m a part of this.","Chiquikta Fountain, a Mississippi Delta native, is the executive director for Delta Hands for Hope in Shaw, Mississippi which is also in the Mississippi Delta.

82,"Jan 7, 2021",WJTV,Peco Foods closing three Mississippi locations,"CANTON, Miss. (WJTV) – Devastating news for poultry plant workers across Mississippi, with Peco foods announcing three locations will close their doors this year.

This came as a surprise to workers and leaders in the community. Now they are looking for new economic opportunities.

Peco Foods shutting down plants and hatcheries will not go unnoticed. In some of these locations, they’ve been operating for over 40 years employing thousands.

Keeping America’s food line active has been a challenge during the Coronavirus pandemic, but soon over 1,000 Mississippians won’t have a job as the fight against COVID-19 continues.

“It’s the economic loss of families and economic loss of individuals who have lost their jobs or will lose their jobs,” Mayor William Truly of Canton said. “They won’t be able to purchase services and goods for themselves or their families.”

In statements released Thursday morning company managers explained this is part of a “long-term strategic vision” to better align with customer needs and “economic conditions” plus adapt to “industry trends”.

“Because it’s equipped with what I believe is a cold storage facility a likely replacement would be another food distribution type facility,” Joey Deason, Executive Director of Madison County Economic Development Authority told us. “Those facilities are USDA approved and the Peco Corporation Owns about 58 acres there.”

There’s no specific timeline on when the Fulton St. plant in Canton, Brookfield, and Hatchery in Philadelphia will close. Mayor Truly heard it could begin by March and Company statements say these plans should be finalized by the Summer.

“We will work with other industries and other individuals to help these people find jobs,” Mayor Truly promised. “We don’t intend to sit back and not serve as a bridge helping the Peco employees.”

“We’ve already been reaching out to the Department of Employment Security, the Win Jobs Center, the Community College, PR firm with Peco as well,” Director Deason added. “It’s our hope that when Amazon plans on opening their facility in August who’s going to be hiring up to 1800 employees to coordinate and provide some opportunities to those as Peco.”

Still many are surprised with Peco Foods having to make these cutbacks after taking in over $1 billion in revenue in 2019 alone. Operating 21 different plants across three states shipping out almost $2 billion pounds of poultry annually has to make these cutbacks.

Peco Foods still plans to redirect resources to expand productivity and invest more in the companies West Point and Sebastopol facility to add operations.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Building on decades of successful collaborations, Mississippi State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service celebrated the new “Atlas” supercomputer Wednesday [Sept. 30] with a virtual event.

With funding from the USDA-ARS, the state-of-the-art system was installed recently at MSU’s High Performance Computing Collaboratory. The system contains 23,040 logical cores with 101 terabytes of total RAM, powering research advances in biocomputing, epidemiology, geospatial technology and more.

“All of us at Mississippi State are very proud of our longstanding partnership with ARS at Stoneville, as well as the ARS facilities and personnel who are on our main campus in Starkville,” MSU President Mark E. Keenum said. “And now, we are thrilled to have the Atlas supercomputer and ARS scientists in the Thad Cochran Research, Technology and Economic Development Park – the largest and most successful research park in the state. Co-locating MSU and ARS scientists creates a unique environment, where together, we can solve complex agriculture and food security problems.”

ARS is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s chief scientific in-house research agency, finding solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS Administrator Chavonda Jacobs-Young said the new partnership increases the computational compacity of SCINet, the organization’s platform for providing scientists access to high performance computer clusters.

“When we began considering how to expand SCINet, we knew Mississippi State University, with their impressive computing capabilities, and wealth of experience in modeling and analysis, would be a great partner,” Jacobs-Young said. “It was clear to us that we could once again align our research efforts with MSU and mutually expand our efforts and impact.”

MSU has been a consistent national leader in computing power and is currently home to the fourth most powerful academic data center in the U.S., Orion. In addition to the USDA, MSU’s high performance computing capabilities have led to critical partnerships and research opportunities with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; NASA; the National Science Foundation; U.S. departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Energy; among other state and federal agencies. The Mississippi Legislature provided funding during the 2020 session for the construction of a new high performance data center in the Cochran Research Park, which will further strengthen MSU’s capabilities and provide new economic opportunities for the state.

MSU is also a national leader in agriculture research, consistently ranking among the top 10 universities in the country for agriculture and natural resources research funding. During his tenure as MSU president, Keenum, a former Under Secretary for the USDA, has made global food security a primary focus area for university research efforts. The USDA-ARS is a close research partner of the university, with ARS and MSU scientists working together to solve agricultural production issues and spur new innovations.

As the agriculture sector continues to implement advances in technology, high performance computing capacity can help meet the demand for data analysis, creating more productive and efficient processes.

“There is limitless potential when combining high performance computing and world-class agriculture research and development,” said MSU Interim Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan. “With our strengths in these areas, MSU is well-positioned to remain at the forefront of the exciting advances that will help feed our growing global population in the decades to come. Working together with partners like the USDA-ARS, we can continue to make a tremendous impact at the state, national and global level.”

The state of Mississippi continues to develop substantial high performance computing capabilities. In addition to the facilities located at MSU, substantial computing systems are located at the Stennis Space Center on the Gulf Coast and the U. S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg. Mississippi’s supercomputing capacity currently ranks fifth in the country.

Posted Monday, December 28, 2020 4:47 pm

New Mexico performs well on access to health care but is falling short on food security and mental wellness, according to the recent household data in “Kids, Families and COVID-19: Pandemic Pain Points and a Roadmap for Recovery,” a 50-state report developed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF) analyzing how families are faring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A news release from the nonprofit New Mexico Voices for Children (NMVC) said the report, citing U.S. Census data, shows 20 percent of New Mexico households with children sometimes or often do not have enough to eat. Only one other state – Mississippi – has as high a rate, while the national average for food insecurity is 14 percent.

New Mexico also has the highest rate – 27 percent – of adults living in households with children who feel down, depressed or hopeless. Mississippi and Pennsylvania also have a rate of 27 percent in this category, while the national average is 21 percent, the report said.

New Mexico’s overall food insecurity rate increased from 15 percent in 2018 to an estimated 21 percent in 2020, NMVC said, based on the national nonprofit Feeding America’s “Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity” report. For Doña Ana County, the report showed overall food insecurity increased from 15.7 percent in 2018 to 21.3 percent in 2020, and child food insecurity increased from 25.8 to 35.8 percent during the same period.

The AECF report also looked at whether families believe they will be able to make their next rent or mortgage payment and if they have health insurance. In New Mexico, 18 percent of adults with children said they have slight or no confidence in being able to pay their rent or mortgage, which is the same as the national rate. Eleven percent do not have health insurance, which is better than the national rate of 12 percent.

An August 2020 report from WalletHub (https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-underprivileged-children/5403) showed New Mexico with the most underprivileged children per capita in the United States, and with the second highest rate of child food-insecurity. New Mexico was the fourth highest in children living in single-parent families and the second highest in percentage of children living in households with below-poverty income, WalletHub said.

Casa de Peregrinos emergency food program in Doña Ana County

“Food insecurity has been an issue in our county for some time now. Right now, the pandemic has put it in the spotlight,” said Lorenzo Alba, executive director of Casa de Peregrinos emergency food program.

Alba said food insecurity is much higher in some parts of Doña Ana County than others, with communities in the southern part of the county, including Sunland Park, Anapra, Santa Teresa, La Union and Chaparral dealing with the most serious food-insecurity issues.

“We are working on a project to distribute more food in the southern part of Doña Ana County,” Alba said. “We’re in this for the long haul. The pandemic will take a few years to recover from economically. We are planning for the worst to come in the next few months. We can always use monetary donations.”

Fifty dollars, he said, provides 300 meals at Casa de Peregrinos, while $100 feeds an average family for a month. Donations of any amount are welcome.

Las Cruces legislator: Diversify the state’s economy

Dealing with food security and mental health issues in New Mexico is “really about economic diversification and how we invest in our communities,” said state Rep. Angelica Rubio, D-Doña Ana, who is a professional community organizer.

“It’s really how we are actually looking at this from building a new economy for New Mexico,” Rubio said.

“With our volatile relationship with oil and gas and the ups and downs of that economy, it’s really put us in dire straits in terms of our ability to look ahead and plan ahead,” Rubio, who begins her fifth year in the New Mexico House of Representatives in January, said. “I feel like we operate from year to year, and that impacts our communities, especially our children.”

Reforming the state’s tax code is an important part of diversifying New Mexico’s economy, Rubio said, and that is “actively being done at the moment,” as individuals and organizations across the state talk to legislators about the issue.

Rubio said she has had nearly 200 conversations with people across the state to gather their thoughts and ideas about economic diversity.

“We always talk about it, but nobody does anything about it,” Rubio said. Now, however, “there are some of us trying to do something about it.”

People are “super excited” about the work that is going on to rebuild the state’s economy, she said.

It’s “exciting to hear,” Rubio said, “especially when folks have been feeling so hopeless around COVID and feeling like there’s no hope for small business. We are in position to re-imagine – and create – something different for ourselves.”

“I think there are a lot of opportunities,” she said. “We’ve just got to be bold and not be afraid to take some chances. Our kids, the next generation, are depending on it.”","Only one other state – Mississippi – has as high a rate, while the national average for food insecurity is 14 percent.

86,"Nov 13, 2019",Clemson University,"New Clemson program to improve health, economic outcomes through food-focused curriculum, research and products · Clemson News","CLEMSON — Clemson’s College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences has established a new program, Land-Grant Local, that will enhance economic, social and health outcomes in South Carolina by more fully integrating the work of local farms into Clemson University.

The program’s immediate goal is to factor foods from local farms into the Clemson environment, but college leadership and faculty are already shaping future curriculum and research centered on food systems that stress solutions for food insecurity and hunger across the state.

Leslie Hossfeld is dean of Clemson’s College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences.

Leslie Hossfeld, dean of the College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences, said the program is a logical next step for the college after its involvement in events centered on food research, such as 2019’s FoodFORWARD research symposium, and its broader efforts in the area of rural health outreach. Hossfeld said the benefits of taking advantage of farms in close proximity to Clemson go far beyond the tastebuds.

“Improving access to local foods has an immediate effect on health, but it also helps to stimulate the South Carolina economy, build relationships across communities and introduce a model that other areas can emulate,” Hossfeld said. “Pursuing a program such as Land-Grant Local further positions us as a 21st century land-grant college dedicated to teaching, research and service to the state.”

A program of this type is not a first for Hossfeld, who previously served as director of the Mississippi Food Insecurity Program and associate director of the Myrlie Evers-Williams Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities during her time as professor and head of the sociology department at Mississippi State University. At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Hossfeld started the Southeastern North Carolina Food Systems Program. The program created a food hub for local, socially disadvantaged farmers and linked farm to institution and throughout UNCW’s Campus Dining.

Hossfeld said one of her primary goals upon arriving at Clemson was to create a program aimed at food insecurity and food systems research.

“I know how much work goes into getting a program such as this one off the ground,” Hossfeld said. “It takes years of relationship building so that every farmer, faculty member, student and community member involved can come together and get the most out of the program.”

Mike McGirr will serve as director of Land-Grant Local for the College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences.

Hossfeld said the appointment of Mike McGirr as director of Land-Grant Local allows the college to skip many steps in the relationship-building needed for the role. McGirr previously served as executive director of Feed & Seed, a nonprofit collaborative organization seeking to increase food security for all South Carolinians.

As the director of Land-Grant Local, McGirr will work directly with Hossfeld and partner with Clemson’s College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences and other entities to develop, nurture and create food systems initiatives at the university. McGirr will bring together an interdisciplinary service-learning, facilities and community-programmatic team focused on food systems.

“I know Clemson just as well as I know the farmers and the consumers that exist in and around it,” McGirr said. “I’ve been engaged for years in measuring the need for local foods in the region as well as measuring the institutional and infrastructure gaps in the system that keep us from having local foods in a profitable and sustainable fashion.”

McGirr said that in the short term, he plans to focus on the “low-hanging fruit, dairy, meat and vegetable products” that can be easily factored into Clemson’s campus. Throughout this process, McGirr will work with Clemson faculty to research the economic, social, communication and health factors that will allow the college to make the case that local food sourcing can and should continue.

“Farmers don’t just grow stuff in the hopes it will sell,” McGirr said. “What I can bring to them is the mechanism to wash, sort, pack and label it to get it into the hands of an institution, and we want to build that to the specifications of Clemson. We want to program exactly what an institution the scale of Clemson University would like to purchase on a seasonal basis from farmers.”

According to Hossfeld, the real power of the program will come from students seeing it in action across the campus while attending classes and engaging in research that illuminate the bigger picture of food systems in the state. Hossfeld said if it can be done at Clemson, it can be scaled and accomplished in communities hit hardest by food insecurity and lack of access to healthy foods.

“Our vision is a fully integrated food system that exists across the university that can act as a model for other universities and communities across the state and beyond,” Hossfeld said. “We’re partnering with anyone who can bring their expertise in food systems to the table. When we pull our resources together, we can reduce waste, increase economic benefits, improve health outcomes and address hunger while creating and enhancing student learning, teaching and research.”

87,"May 5, 2020",Baylor University,Meals-to-You Expands to Serve 5 Million Meals a Week to Rural Children,"New public-private partnership, including Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, surpasses initial goal to serve five times more kids during COVID-19

Media Contact: Lori Fogleman, Baylor University Media and Public Relations, 254-709-5959

Follow us on Twitter: @BaylorUMedia

WACO, Texas (May 5, 2020) – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced a major expansion of Meals-to-You, an innovative partnership between the Baylor University Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, USDA, McLane Global and PepsiCo, to feed low-income kids in rural areas. The initiative will serve nearly 5 million meals per week to rural children impacted by COVID-19-related school closures – five times its original goal.

“We are grateful to be a part of an innovative team made up of both the public and private sectors motivated by the strong desire to help our neighbors in need,” said Jeremy Everett, executive director of the Baylor University Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty. “We hope that the boxes of food will nourish children and communicate to their families that they are not in this tough circumstance alone.”

Initially, Meals-to-You aimed to deliver nearly 1 million meals per week to students eligible for free and reduced-price meals in a limited number of rural schools closed due to COVID-19, but that goal has been quickly surpassed. Meals-to-You has already shipped nearly 3.5 million meals to the homes of children in 12 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

In the last few weeks, 23 additional states and Puerto Rico have requested to participate in Meals-to-You, so the partnership is now quickly ramping up to serve 5 million meals per week to help meet growing demand. With the initial weeks of the program having been a huge success, USDA worked closely with partners to substantially increase capacity. Thirteen of those states are approved and have families either enrolling or in the final stages of verification, while 10 additional states have recently started the application process.

The Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty continues to work closely with states interested in the initiative and can now add more states to the program to meet continued demand. In addition, the Meals-to-You expansion will include a research component led by Baylor researchers, who will study family’s responses to the COVID-19 crisis and the potential impact of Meals-to-You.

“With this award, Baylor University is advancing research that sheds light on the economic implications of the coronavirus outbreak,” said Kathy Krey, Ph.D., director of research and administration of the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty. “We are evaluating the challenges and successes of the Meals-to-You program and how it impacts families’ food security.”

Meals-to-You boxes contain 20 nutritious meals – 10 breakfasts and 10 lunches – to cover the meals children would normally receive at school over two school weeks. Foods contained in the boxes meet USDA’s Summer Food Service Program meal standards and may include items like milk, fruit cups, cereal, whole-grain crackers and chili. Boxes are delivered directly to children’s doorsteps via the U.S. Postal Service and other delivery services.

USDA is hearing directly from families about how much this program means to them.

“I just wanted to say ‘An Unmeasurable Amount of Thank You’s’ are being sent to you and the entire teams it took to coordinate, prepare, and distribute these meals across my community,” said a mother from rural Texas. “I sincerely appreciate the incredible amount of effort it took for this to happen and I’m indebted to you and your teams! Thank you for making a difference in my household without even knowing who I am (we’re a family of 5 with one parent working with reduced wages).”

“Uncertain and difficult times call for unprecedented actions and big picture ideas. Rural children affected by school closures faced food insecurity, but these great American groups and companies stepped up to help their fellow countrymen by delivering boxes of food across the country,” Secretary Perdue said. “This program has been so successful and faced such high demand that we are expanding to 5 million meals a week. Our partnership to feed kids embodies President Trump’s whole of America approach to tackling the coronavirus by utilizing the best of America – private sector ingenuity with public sector backing.”

“This USDA-funded program has been a lifeline to thousands of students across rural America that would otherwise go hungry during this challenging period,” said Denton McLane, chairman of McLane Global. “We’ve shifted to a 24-hour production schedule across all locations to meet the demand, and couldn’t be prouder of our partners, employees and the people on the ground working to ensure these meals get to those who need it most.”

“We’re proud to partner with the USDA and Baylor to deliver meals directly to students who need them now more than ever,” said Matt Smith, senior director of Food for Good at PepsiCo. “Since 2009, we’ve been operating a U.S. nutrition program within PepsiCo called Food for Good that has delivered more than 30 million nutritious meals to children through afterschool and summer programs. In this time when millions of children are affected by school closures, it is a privilege to bring our scale and experience to this innovative partnership to serve our neighbors in need nationwide.”

USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) continues to provide additional options and flexibilities to feed children during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some examples include:

Issuing 21 nationwide waivers for child nutrition programs to allow for innovative methods of meal service and distribution during this unprecedented crisis pandemic;

for child nutrition programs to allow for innovative methods of meal service and distribution during this unprecedented crisis pandemic; Launching the Meals 4 Kids site finder in both English and Spanish to help families across America find free meals for kids during the public health emergency; and

in both English and Spanish to help families across America find free meals for kids during the public health emergency; and Approving Pandemic-EBT in 19 states, which provides food assistance to families of children eligible for free or reduced-price meals dealing with school closures.

To learn more about FNS’s response to COVID-19, visit www.fns.usda.gov/coronavirus and follow on Twitter at @USDANutrition.

FNS administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that leverage American’s agricultural abundance to ensure children and low-income individuals and families have nutritious food to eat. FNS also co-develops the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which provide science-based nutrition recommendations and serve as the cornerstone of federal nutrition policy.

PepsiCo and McLane Global have been selected as the private sector partners in support of this initiative. PepsiCo generously provided $1 million in funding to the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty to support school districts and to identify the children most in need. McLane Global will continue its participation from the initial pilot of the program. Both companies have provided prior philanthropic support to hunger initiatives and Baylor University. Drayton McLane Jr., chairman of the McLane Group, serves on the Baylor University Board of Regents as Regent Emeritus and chair of Regent Emeriti. Baylor University also holds a comprehensive contract with PepsiCo for beverage pouring and representation rights on campus.

Struggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloat

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state's food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a long-standing initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

""All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,"" said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. ""When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.""

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don't have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic's early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

""If food banks can't take more product (from the California program), farmers are going to go out of business,"" Linkhart said. ""That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.""

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

""That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,"" said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. ""It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.""

Raudabaugh said the state's dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers' distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don't make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

""We're providing many hundreds of percents more (to food banks) than pre-pandemic,"" Raudabaugh said. ""Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these (partnerships). It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.""

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

""The money has to be there to justify the harvest,"" Michael said, ""and this solves some of that problem.""

On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen's small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers' pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

""It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,"" Van Laanen said. ""It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.""

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he's already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi's Farm stay afloat.

""It was really timely,"" Chichester said. ""It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early time frame.""

Karen Affeld, the development group's executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

""Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,"" she said. ""That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.""

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state's Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California's that launched in 2014.

It's a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they're harvesting crops bound for food banks.

""Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,"" said David Bobanick, the group's executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another 4 pounds are donated by farmers.

""Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,"" he said. ""It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.""

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

""Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,"" said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets' food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she's heard from parents who couldn't otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture _ known as CSA _ in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program's website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

""You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,"" said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. ""People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.""

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

""We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,"" Lebeaux said. ""Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.""

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

""We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,"" said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. ""One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.""

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

""If there's one silver lining,"" she said, ""it's that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.""","Farmers and food banksStruggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloatAs the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers.
And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state's food banks needed to triple their food supply.
The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks.

91,"Jan 13, 2020",,Bully’s Closet and Pantry aims to meet several needs at MSU,"STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.

“We’re going to get more on Monday,” Clarke said. “You’re fine.”

All the milk was gone by Friday evening at Bully’s Closet and Pantry, a one-stop shop for food, professional clothing, school supplies and hygiene products for Mississippi State University students. It opened with a ribbon-cutting Friday morning and started distributing supplies that afternoon.

The shelves were lined with canned fruits and vegetables, beans and soup, boxes of cereal, Kleenex, personal items such as razors and deodorant and much more. Frozen meals and perishables such as milk and eggs were kept in the freezer and fridge, with a list on a white board keeping track of them.

School supplies such as pens and notebooks fill another set of shelves, and the next room in the small Morgan Avenue building contains racks lined with professional clothing, including blazers, for students to use as needed for job interviews. The building was formerly used for faculty housing, and BCP acquired the space in September 2018.

About 30 percent of college students nationwide struggle with food insecurity, so BCP will serve as “one more layer of support” for those students, MSU Vice President of Student Affairs Regina Hyatt told The Dispatch.

“We hope (the pantry) can alleviate, for the students that are most in need, some of the stress that they experience in not knowing where their next meal is coming from,” she said.

The pantry will be open from 1 to 6 p.m. on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. Students can come in once a week, and BCP provides a makeshift grocery list so they can feel like they are actually shopping, said Clarke, one of BCP’s three graduate assistant staff members.

There was “a good rush” of students when the doors first opened, Clarke said, but by 3 p.m. the shop was empty, most likely due to the stormy weather.

Hackett and Dominique Williams, both juniors, came in around 4:30 despite the downpour and filled a bag with canned soup, beans, apple juice and paper towels, among other things. When Hackett picked up bread and peanut butter and asked for jelly, Clarke made sure he and Williams were OK with the only available flavor, grape, before handing them a jar.

A group effort

Mayah Emerson knew that other Southeastern Conference universities had professional clothes closets, she said, so she included the idea in her platform when she successfully ran for president of the Mississippi State University Student Association in the spring semester of 2018.

“Students were asking about places to access professional clothing, so we really just saw it as meeting a need,” Emerson said.

The idea expanded to include a food pantry when the Office of Student Affairs got involved, she said, and her successor, current SA president Jake Manning, continued her work with the university to bring BCP to life.

Over about 18 months, BCP amassed 900 cans of vegetables, 400 cans of fruit and more than 1,000 toothbrushes and tubes of toothpaste, to name a few, said Montelleo Hobley, behavioral intervention team coordinator in the MSU Dean of Students’ Office.

A wide variety of student organizations and campus departments worked to stock the pantry, including MSU Athletics, which held drives at several football games and offered free tickets to two basketball games in exchange for donations, Hyatt said. MSU Police Chief Vance Rice asked every officer in the department to fill a box with supplies, and they did, Hyatt said.

BCP collected tax-deductible monetary donations through the MSU Foundation, which will continue to identify and pursue donors, and student organizations will help by holding food and supply drives, Hyatt said.

MSU President Mark Keenum had three words for Hyatt when she approached him with the idea for BCP: “Make it happen.”

“When we think about people who are in need of food, we tend to think about people in far-off, distant lands, but we have people in need right here in our own community, right here on our campus,” Keenum told a crowd of about 50 at Friday’s press conference.

BCP is the newest addition to MSU’s Food Security Network, which includes the Block by Block program for students to donate part of their meal plan to other students and the Maroon Meals alert system for the location and availability of food on campus.

Block by Block currently serves between 200 and 300 students, with participation increasing in recent years, Hyatt said. Faculty in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition are conducting research that will hopefully shed more light on how prevalent food insecurity is on the MSU campus, she said.

BCP will remain stocked with food items thanks to partnerships with the United Way of Central Mississippi and the Hattiesburg-based nonprofit Extra Table, as well as student and faculty donations, Hyatt said. The donation boxes in the back of the building saw several contributions Friday, Clarke said.

The staff is open to feedback on what students need that BCP does not yet have, such as shoes and a section for baby supplies. Hackett asked the staff for salt and pepper, and Clarke put it on the list of items to add.

After filling their bag, Hackett and Williams hoped to catch a bus in order to stay out of the rain on their way out of BCP Friday afternoon. Hackett, a first-semester transfer student from Hinds Community College in Raymond, said he is grateful for the pantry’s help but hopes he does not find himself using it often.

“I know there are more disadvantaged people than I am,” he said.","STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.

92,"Oct 24, 2020",EcoWatch,Pandemic Threatens Food Security for Many College Students,"By Matthew J. Landry and Heather Eicher-Miller

When university presidents were surveyed in spring of 2020 about what they felt were the most pressing concerns of COVID-19, college students going hungry didn't rank very high.

Why It Matters This is not just a matter of growling stomachs. This is a straight-up education and health issue. When students don't really know if they'll be able to get enough to eat, it can lead to a series of problems that make it harder to stay in school. For instance, it can affect academic performance and sleep quality. It can also lead to poor mental and physical health outcomes for college students. Food insecurity can also result in disrupted eating patterns if there is not enough food or the variety or quality of what someone eats is low.

Campus Food Pantries Previous strategies by colleges and universities to fight hunger in their student bodies have varied widely. They include campus food pantries, emergency cash assistance and nutrition education through noncredit classes or workshopse. These strategies were put to the test during the spring 2020 semester, when nearly three in five students said they had trouble meeting their own basic needs during the pandemic. College food pantries saw big increases in demand. Others said they were getting less donated food. This made it even harder to meet the rising food needs of students. Campus food pantries largely rely on local or regional food banks, which have been dealing with greater demand than they are able to meet during the pandemic. The many students who are attending college remotely will, of course, have less access to campus resources like food pantries.

Federal Help Other potential ways to get more food are government programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Yet the majority of able-bodied students are not eligible. Long-standing restrictions, like the college SNAP rule, prevent full-time students from receiving these benefits. Such regulatory hurdles were created under the assumption that most students can rely on their parents to get enough to eat. However, college students have vastly different levels of financial support. Some students can rely on their parents for everything and others cannot rely on their parents for anything. Decreased reliance on parental financial support is especially common for first-generation students and students of color, who now make up 45% of enrolled college students. Under normal circumstances, many college students might rely on part-time jobs to pay for their food.

Two-thirds of the students who were employed before the pandemic said that job insecurity was a problem for them, according to the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice #RealCollege survey. As the number of jobless young Americans remains elevated, unemployment and underemployment remain a problem. Jobless students face a potential double threat of less money for food and unemployment benefits cutting off their access to SNAP because the program requires most students to work at least part time. Attempts have been made at both the federal and state levels to meet the basic food needs of college students. Lawmakers have focused on temporarily suspending eligibility requirements or expanding the criteria for participating in nutrition assistance programs. Seventeen bills aiming to address food insecurity among college students were introduced to Congress during the 2019-2020 legislative session. However, these proposals failed to gain momentum, and the four COVID-19 stimulus bills to date have not addressed the hunger needs of college students. Notably, some students were ineligible to personally receive a CARES Act stimulus relief payment because they were claimed as dependents by their parents.

Short-Term Solutions Universities and colleges can make it a priority to ensure students are aware of all available campus resources and services. They can also potentially help students apply for federal assistance benefits. Campus food pantries are not a fully effective and efficacious solution for the scale of college food insecurity, but they can be a good interim solution to increase access to food for students. Campuses without food pantries can start one, making use of resources the College and University Food Bank Alliance provides. Schools with food pantries can try to get them to reach more students. Universities and colleges can also lean on one another for support. The Alabama Campus Coalition for Basic Needs is a great example of this. It brings together 10 universities across the state of Alabama collectively working to address student food insecurity.

93,"Nov 30, 2019",NBC News,Trump administration proposals could cause millions to lose food stamps,"Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

Over the past year, the Department of Agriculture proposed three changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. The new rules create stricter work requirements for program eligibility, cap deductions for utility allowances and “reform” the way 40 states automatically enroll families into SNAP when they receive other forms of federal aid.

A study by the Urban Institute released this week examined the three rules in combination for the first time and found that 3.7 million fewer people would receive SNAP in an average month, 2.2 million households would see their average monthly benefits drop by $127, more than 3 million others would see an average drop of $37 per month, and 982,000 students would lose access to free or reduced lunches.

“What we found is that overall the three proposed changes would reduce the number of households participating in SNAP by about 11 percent if this was implemented in 2018,"" said Laura Wheaton, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who conducted the study. ""It’s about a 9.4 percent reduction in the number of people participating and about an 8 percent reduction in overall benefits.”

Critics and experts say that would be antithetical to the program's goals to address food insecurity in the United States.

Craig Gundersen, an agricultural and consumer economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has studied the program for more than two decades, said that about a million people could become food-insecure because of the change. He added that 50 percent of those 3.7 million SNAP beneficiaries were already food insecure despite the assistance.

The changes, he said, would put many Americans in a worse position, increasing hunger and health issues. Each additional adult who becomes food-insecure sees an additional $2,000 in healthcare costs, Gundersen explained.

""The essential goal of the program is to mitigate hunger and its consequences in the United States,” he said. ""Anything that impedes SNAP of doing that is very problematic as it leads to food insecurity in our country.""

The USDA, meanwhile, estimates that the changes would reduce the SNAP budget by about $4.2 billion.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the work requirements in a USA Today column, emphasizing that it would save taxpayer dollars.

“At USDA, our informal motto is ‘Do Right and Feed Everyone,’” Perdue wrote. “With these proposed improvements, we will ‘do right’ by the taxpayers and restore the dignity of work to the able-bodied who receive SNAP benefits. And, we will ‘feed everyone’ by ensuring the health and stability of SNAP for those who truly need it.”

All of the new rules have gone through a comment period with the changes to utilities currently taking feedback until Monday. Tens of thousands of people have already responded, with most providing negative responses.

The latest rule change proposed by the Trump administration would cause millions of people to take smaller deductions for shelter and utility costs, which are considered when a person applies for SNAP benefits. Critics say that would force people to choose between buying food and paying for housing.

Gundersen said this change will prove to be a major cost for those living in metropolitan areas with high living costs.

It could also create a steeper financial cliff for some beneficiaries. Those in danger of losing access to SNAP might be discouraged from working because the new calculation would put them in a higher income bracket, causing them to lose access, Gundersen explained

“On the one hand they want to encourage people to work, but on the other they would be taking away that incentive,” Gundersen said.

But the main issue is that SNAP is not intended to be a work program in the first place, Gundersen said, but is instead intended to address food insecurity within the United States.

As it operates now, SNAP does not discourage people from participating in the labor market, he said.

""There are some assistance programs that do discourage people to work, but this is not one of them,"" Gundersen said, adding that what lawmakers should be asking is: ""What makes this program work so well and why does it work well as compared to other programs?""

These new rules also have advocates in states like Nevada worried. Nevada could see up to 22 percent of recipients lose access to food stamps, which could be devastating in a place where 12.3 percent of households face food insecurity, according to the USDA.

“SNAP is related to hunger and getting people the nutrition they need,” said Jocelyn Lantrip, the communications director at Food Bank of Northern Nevada. “Food shouldn’t be a luxury.”

With a tech boom raising income levels but not enough to cover rising housing costs, Lantrip said that these changes could create further food insecurity issues, which remain close to the levels that the Food Bank of Northern Nevada saw during the recession.

At the height of the recession, Lantrip said her food bank helped 103,000 people per month. Now, during a period of perceived economic stability, she said they are helping 91,000.

Food banks like hers wouldn’t be able to accommodate for the needs of an additional 196,000 people, which is the number in Nevada who would likely need help accessing food if these rules were to go into effect, Lantrip said.

“That’s really hard for food banks to keep up with if you have that kind of decline in benefits,” she said. “We support people if they fall outside of the safety net, but we can’t replace the safety net as a food bank. We’re spinning our wheels already, because when unemployment is low people assume hunger is low, but we’re just helping more working poor than before.”","Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

94,"Sep 14, 2020",,"Grants support expanded local food capacity, security","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Twenty-seven Illinois farmers were awarded a total of $250,000 in grants from the Illinois Stewardship Alliance’s Resilience Fund.

The Resilience Fund, with financial support from the Chicago Region Food System Fund, was designed to help farmers collaborate and invest in infrastructure to scale up their business models to meet skyrocketing demand for local food spurred by the pandemic.

“We received over 80 applications from local food producers requesting nearly $1 million in support,” said Liz Moran Stelk, Alliance Executive director.

“Farmers’ projects — to build walk-in coolers and packing sheds, construct hoop houses, install irrigation, to name a few — inspired us about farmers’ grit and determination to feed our communities.”

A diverse panel of a dozen agriculture and food specialists reviewed applications and selected Resilience Fund recipients who produce local food across Illinois.

Dan Lobbes at Green Earth Harvest Farm in Naperville will receive a $10,000 grant for a refrigeration unit.

“As we’ve had the third warmest summer on record, every day brings a worry about the patched together cooling system we have on the farm. We are so grateful for this opportunity to upgrade to something more dependable,” Lobbes said.

“What I thought might happen slowly over many years is suddenly a reality in the very near future,” Kacey Nelson of Two Million Blooms in Urbana said of her project to convert an old outbuilding into a dedicated honey house, which will help them streamline and scale up the business.

Jill Rendleman of All Seasons Farm in Cobden said she and the farm’s workers, interns and volunteers are excited to upgrade their packing shed with a cooling unit and insulation — their working environment will be much better.

“This grant will take us to another level of production in terms of both quality and quantity of organic produce,” Rendleman said.

For Down at the Farms, a 60-member farm collective in Central Illinois based in Fairbury, their $25,000 grant will support their pivot from restaurant sales to direct-to-consumer sales.

In the wake of the shelter in place order in March, farmer Marty Travis and his son, Will, who lead the Down at the Farms collective, lost 30 Chicago farm-to-table restaurant accounts overnight.

A new walk-in cooler and delivery truck will help the collective meet new consumer demand and sustain restaurant buyers who are starting to come back.

“The pandemic has changed the way we all think about food. We need local supply chains for food security into the future,” Travis said.

“It’s clear there is so much need for small and diverse farms to access resources. Local food producers make our communities more resilient and food secure in the face of future pandemics and climate crises,” Stelk said.

“COVID-19 has had an immense impact on farmers, particularly those who focus on selling their crops locally,” said Daniel Doyle, program officer for the Lumpkin Family Foundation in Mattoon, a founding donor to the Chicago Region Food System Fund.

“These producers are the backbone of a resilient local food system and their success is critical to our collective food security. Their ability to access capital in order to pivot business models, ensure their ability to get products to consumers and increase production to meet community need has been critical.

“The Chicago Region Food System Fund is proud to support programs like the Illinois Stewardship Alliance Resilience Fund and their great work providing resources to the family farms we depend upon.”

95,"Jun 28, 2019",Food Tank,Severe Weather in the U.S. Is Impacting Global Food Security – Food Tank,"Across the key agricultural states in the Midwestern United States, crop plantings were delayed because of severe weather including heavy rain and flooding. This delay significantly impacts corn and soybean acreage; both crops play a major role in the global agricultural economy and have triggered a spike in commodity prices, indicating the impacts of climate change on food price volatility and potential food insecurity.

Recent severe weather across the Midwest is making headlines in mainstream news and on social media for its impact on agriculture. The most recent USDA Crop Progress Report states that 32 percent of corn plantings have emerged, compared to the 69 percent average over the past three years, while 11 percent of soybean plants had emerged compared to a 35 percent average; the rainfall delays both crop planting and germination time. Environmental activist Bill McKibben tweeted the alarm “Normally, at this point in [the] season 90 percent of America’s corn crop is in the ground. But thanks to endless rain, it’s 58 percent this year. For soybeans, 29 percent planted instead of the usual 66 percent. A hotter planet = more rain and more drought (and horribly stressed farmers).”

As of June 15th, analysts predicted farmers would be forced to file insurance claims on 2.2 million unplanted soybean acres; soybeans are planted as a backup crop for corn which has “failed to reach the halfway [planting] mark by May 19 for the first time on record” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

All of this rain has caused speculation on the available supply of these crops leading to price spikes. In late May, the Chicago Board of Trade reported escalating prices of corn and soybeans. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported in early June that global food prices rose for the fifth consecutive month in “response to diminishing production prospects in the United States of America… due to widespread flooding and rain.” Corn and soy prices jumped 8.5 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively. By June 17th, corn prices reached a five-year contract high of US$4.64-¼.

The International Food Policy Research Institute has published research finding that climate change causes a decline in global food production and impacts every step of the food chain increasing food prices. Recent NASA imagery shows the impact of this severe weather on cropland and transportation infrastructure using dramatic comparative aerial images of an overflowing Arkansas River and flooding across parts of Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Weeks of flooding washed out roads and breached levees resulting in millions of dollars of damage. The USDA reported the continental U.S. has just experienced its wettest 12 month period resulting in a “painfully slow 2019 planting pace.”

This is not the end of weather-related troubles: “a cool wet summer and delayed planting could reduce yield potential due to a shortened growing season and increased risk of corn and soybeans not reaching full maturity prior to the first autumn freeze,” reports USDA. The FAO predicts that this current decline will still provide a “relatively comfortable supply level.” This current price spike is not on par with those previously experienced in 2008 and 2010 but emphasizes the impact of the globalized food economy in which severe weather scenarios in one country have impacts felt across the world.

96,"Sep 15, 2020",Civil Eats,Connecting Fishermen with Hungry Communities Can also Benefit Local Food Systems,"While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw. Tribal members were living in campers and RVs with no electricity and a single hose for running water. Meant to be temporary, these “in-lieu fishing communities” were created in the 1950s when the federal government-built dams that forced tribal members to leave their ancestral fishing grounds.

It was like “being in a homeless shelter, without the infrastructure,” said Rodrigo, who is part Mohawk, a member of the Native American Committee of the American Bar Association, and legal and operations director for We Do Better Relief.

Rodrigo was handing out food boxes as part of a pandemic relief effort led by a new Pacific Northwest coalition called The Wave. Efforts started earlier that day at an event in Cascade Locks, Oregon, in collaboration with the Columbia River Inter-tribal Fish Commission and other groups, before moving out to the in-lieu fishing communities. The event focused on tribal members but was open to the public.

Rodrigo brought 850 pounds of fresh-frozen Alaskan lingcod, a type of groundfish, to provide alongside U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Boxes provided by the Oregon Food Bank. The Wave also provided a food truck, KOi Fusion, that served 400 free teriyaki fish rice bowls, cooked with more of the lingcod.

A partnership with the community-supported fishery (CSF) Alaskans Own, the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, and the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association, the Wave’s fish donation program involves a slew of Northwest food security groups, tribal organizations, chefs, food trucks, and seafood groups. The groups received funding from a nonprofit accelerator group, Multiplier, to purchase 130,000 pounds of fish from small boat, Alaskan fishermen to provide to food-insecure communities in Washington and Oregon.

While the program focuses on rural, and/or predominantly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), communities, it’s recently pivoted to feeding firefighters and evacuees as deadly wildfires sweep Oregon. Getting seafood—or, truly, any fresh and healthy food—to communities like those in-lieu settlements in Oregon and Washington poses additional challenges, but those are precisely what these partners aim to solve.

The partnership is one of six U.S. fish donation programs funded by Multiplier through its Catch Together program, which supports community-based fishermen. At its core, Catch Together’s grant program aims to provide fishermen a living wage to help feed food insecure families a highly nutritious, lean protein—locally caught seafood—that is rarely, if ever, included in food relief efforts.

“My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

But the fishermen groups it supports, from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, view the program as a bigger opportunity to reconnect local fishermen with their communities, at a time when many feel disconnected by global markets that whisk their catch from the dock to far-flung corners of the world. And they seek to leverage the grant funds to overcome barriers that have made it difficult to integrate their sustainably harvested catch into local and regional food systems.

“All of these different organizations and fishermen, they’re really getting excited about . . . how do we get a little bit closer to the people we’re feeding, and how do we support our communities,” said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, one of the grantees. “My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

Shoring Up Fishing Communities

Prices paid fishermen have plummeted everywhere during the pandemic as restaurants have closed or scaled back services. Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, for example, is selling for half the price fishermen were paid in 2019, according to Elizabeth Herendeen of Alaskans Own.

The Catch Together funding allows the groups to buy sustainably harvested fish and pay fishermen a stable price to keep them fishing at a time when one in eight households don’t have enough food to eat. In some cases, as with the lingcod fishermen in Alaska, the grant funds have tipped the balance: Without that funding, the fishermen wouldn’t have been able to go out fishing.

Catch Together encourages its grantees to use its funding as seed money to help them achieve longer term goals to shore up their resiliency—such as by creating a sustainable value-added product, like a fish cake or fish soup, that they can eventually market or get the USDA to purchase for one of its national food assistance programs.

“Our hope is that they’re able to use our grants to create a runway to a sustainable product, or think through how they can serve underserved parts of the community,” Paul Parker, Catch Together’s managing partner and president, told Civil Eats.

Describing Catch Together as a “hub in the middle,” Parker said it’s “uplifting to watch all the different fishing communities come up with ideas about how to serve this need, and then building the programming and cross-pollinating to one another.”

Figuring out the food donation piece can be challenging, however. First the groups need to select the species and harvest the fish, which isn’t always easy. Then they need to turn the fish into a product that’s readily usable by food assistance programs, which can also be tricky: Some programs don’t want seafood because their clients aren’t accustomed to eating it. Last, they need to work out the logistics of the distribution.

“Most of the organizations of fishermen we’re working with have deep experience in one or two of those areas, but not all three,” said Parker.

That’s why Alaskans Own and the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, which received a grant to harvest lingcod and sablefish, teamed up with the Wave, said Herendeen. “We knew the Wave had the structure in place to help move the fish to families in need.”

Reaching In-Lieu Fishing Communities

The Wave program aims to feed more than 600,000 people in rural and BIPOC communities through early November with a combination of hot meals and fresh-frozen fillets, and it piggybacks off the efforts of other food relief organizations. That means “things change on the daily,” notes Keri Johns, a manager at The Wave.","While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw.
Meant to be temporary, these “in-lieu fishing communities” were created in the 1950s when the federal government-built dams that forced tribal members to leave their ancestral fishing grounds.
Rodrigo was handing out food boxes as part of a pandemic relief effort led by a new Pacific Northwest coalition called The Wave.
Rodrigo brought 850 pounds of fresh-frozen Alaskan lingcod, a type of groundfish, to provide alongside U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Boxes provided by the Oregon Food Bank.
The partnership is one of six U.S. fish donation programs funded by Multiplier through its Catch Together program, which supports community-based fishermen."
97,"Sep 6, 2018",Baptist Standard,One in seven Texas households lacked reliable access to food,"One in seven Texas households had limited or uncertain access to food in recent years, a new study from the U.S. Department of Agriculture revealed.

The report showed 14 percent of Texas households experienced food insecurity in 2015-17, higher than the national rate of 12 percent during the same time period. The study showed significant improvement since 2012-14, when 17.2 percent of Texas households were food-insecure.

However, Feeding Texas—formerly the Texas Food Bank Network—noted Texas still had 1.4 million food-insecure households, more than any other state except California.

“Despite claims to the contrary, hunger is still a major issue facing too many Texans,” said Celia Cole, chief executive officer of Feeding Texas.

Prevalence of severe food insecurity reported

In food-insecure households, which lack consistent access to enough food for everyone to enjoy a healthy diet, families frequently cut back on groceries to pay for lodging, utilities or medicine. Nationally, the typical food-secure household spent 23 percent more on food in 2017 than the typical food-insecure household of the same size and composition, the report noted.

In addition to tracking general food insecurity—which means at some point, a household lacked access to food to provide healthy nutrition for all its members—the USDA also registered the rate of more severe “very low” food security.

Nationally, 4.8 percent of households reported “very low” food security in 2015-17; in Texas, 5.8 percent of households fell in that category during those years. That showed marked improvement over the 6.2 percent of Texas households that experienced “very low” food security in 2012-14, but it was higher than the 5 percent average in 2005-07, prior to the period economists identified as the Great Recession.

“We are encouraged that the food insecurity rate in Texas continues to decline. Over that last several years, organizations and leaders across the state have collaborated to address food insecurity, and we’ve made important strides,” said Kathy Krey, research director of the Texas Hunger Initiative at Baylor University.

“Still, we have not reached pre-recession levels, and close to 2 million Texas households are food insecure, and that number is far too high. We need to continue to work together to build a system wherein individuals and families can access the food they need.”

‘Lots and lots of work to do’

Signs of improvement give Texans reason to celebrate progress in fighting hunger, but the significant number of households that continue to experience food insecurity point to a need for continuing effort, said Ferrell Foster, director of ethics and justice with the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission.

“Those of us who hurt for the malnourished in Texas see in these numbers that we still have lots and lots of work to do,” Foster said. “We are doing better, but there are still more than a million Texans who are uncertain about being able to eat healthy meals. They suffer today, and their malnutrition will have long-term consequences for them, their families and their communities.”

The USDA reported 10 states with a food insecurity rate higher than Texas—New Mexico, 17.9 percent; Arizona, 17.4 percent; Louisiana, 17.3 percent; Mississippi, 17.2 percent; Alabama, 16.3 percent; Oklahoma, 15 percent; West Virginia, 14.9 percent; Kentucky, 14.7 percent; and both Maine and North Carolina, 14.4 percent.

At 7.4 percent, Hawaii had the lowest food insecurity rate in the nation, followed by New Jersey at 8.6 percent and Colorado at 9.2 percent.

In addition to Texas, 11 other states had a higher prevalence of “very low” food security than the national average—Alabama and Louisiana, 7.1 percent; Mississippi and New Mexico, 6.6 percent; Arkansas, 6.5 percent; Maine and Oklahoma, 6.4 percent; West Virginia, 6.2 percent; Ohio, 6.1 percent; and Tennessee, 5.7 percent.

Congress debates future of federal nutrition programs

The USDA released its report at a point when members of Congress were debating the future of federal nutrition programs such as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as Food Stamps.

President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers issued a report in July declaring the War on Poverty is “largely over and a success,” and the council recommended more stringent requirements for nondisabled adults who receive assistance.

The USDA reported about 58 percent of food-insecure households participate in one or more of the three largest federal food and nutrition assistance programs—SNAP; WIC, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children; or the federal school lunch program.

“Our elected leaders should reject any proposal to cut programs like SNAP that help so many Texans make ends meet,” Cole said. “Taking food away from these families by cutting SNAP, or reducing resources for food banks to meet the need of their communities, will only increase food insecurity. … The best way to help our neighbors is not to take food off the table, but put more opportunities on it.”

Any effort to make households more food secure demands the cooperation of multiple institutions, Foster noted.

“Put simply, people need food for today and jobs for their tomorrows. And those who cannot work need our ongoing help,” he said. “Churches, schools and governments must work together to address these issues, and that is being done in more and more places in Texas. We are all in this together.”

FOREST, Miss. (AP) — Days after immigration agents arrested 680 Latino workers in a massive workplace sting at seven Mississippi chicken processing plants, job seekers flocked to an employment fair Monday in hopes of filling some of those now-empty positions.

Koch Foods, based near Chicago, held the job fair to recruit new workers at one of its Morton plants, after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Wednesday arrested 243 workers suspected of working without legal authorization.

By 10 a.m., a crowd of dozens was on hand, and steady stream of people came and went. Most were black and spoke with accents from the American South. A few appeared white or Hispanic.

While the raids at seven plants were unprecedented, chicken processing facilities are normally plagued by heavy turnover and ravenously seek employees. Koch spokesman Jim Gilliland said Monday that job fairs are a “frequent occurrence.”

“They are part of normal efforts to employ,” Gilliand wrote in an email. “In this environment of relative full employment, most businesses are looking for qualified applicants; Koch is no different.”

Eddie Nicholson Jr. of Louisville, among Monday’s applicants at a state employment service office in Forest, was more succinct: “They hire anybody.”

The 25-year-old has worked in chicken plants before and was considering a return, but wanted to see if wages had gone up. Plants in recent years have typically paid $11 to $12 an hour, according to labor statistics, but Nicholson said he wants $15 an hour.

Like Nicholson, many who applied Monday were chicken plant veterans. They understand the arduous and sometimes dangerous work of slaughtering, butchering and packaging chicken, from hanging up live chickens, to pulling off skin, to cutting with super-sharp knives, to boxing up chicken, much of it done in near-freezing temperatures. The line moves fast and people repeat the same motions over and over.

“It’s definitely hard,” said Cedric Griffith of Magee, who said he’s been working at McDonald’s after getting fired from another chicken processor for missing too many days. “You’re going to lose of lot of weight. Nine times out of 10, when that week is over, you’re tired.”

That draining work, at relatively low wages, leads many people to quit. So chicken plants are always hiring. Angela Stuesse, an anthropology professor at the University of North Carolina who spent years among labor organizers in Morton and nearby towns, said the desire for cheap, docile labor led poultry firms to begin recruiting Spanish-speakers in the late 1990s. At first, Stuesse said they were people who could legally work. But they were eventually replaced by Mexicans, Guatemalans and others who often lacked legal working papers. Later, came a wave from Argentina, Uruguay and Peru.

Koch has hundreds of jobs posted for its Morton facilities on a Mississippi state government job board. Only a few dozen other jobs are listed within 10 miles of Morton, many of them at fast food restaurants or dollar stores. The options are a little better in the larger town of Forest, thanks to defense contractor Raytheon and a sawmill. But Tyson, Koch and other chicken plants still dominate the market. Pearl River Foods, a plant raided in the town of Carthage, posted 200 jobs Aug. 1, starting at $7.25 an hour.

Ralphtheia Nichols, a 51-year-old Lake resident, estimated she had worked for various chicken plants maybe 20 times over the decade. She was back Monday to apply again, seeking part-time work.

“This is one of the lowest places for income and they really don’t pay,” Nichols said of employers in the area.

The Koch plant last year agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle a federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission lawsuit alleging that managers sexually harassed female employees and discriminated against them because of their race and national origin. Citing a pattern of immigration enforcement actions after companies got into trouble over working conditions, many Democrats and union supporters in recent days have asked whether the raids had something to do with Koch’s troubles.

“It’s more than just coincidental,” said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who represents areas including other plants that were raised, but not Koch. He and other House members raised the issue in a Friday letter demanding information about the raids from Attorney General William Barr and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan

Gilliland, the Koch spokesman, denied that the raid was related to the EEOC settlement

But whatever triggered the raid, it could have long-term effects on the labor pool. In some places raids have led immigrants to move away. And if they stay, Stuesse said raids tend to keep immigrants terrified of advocating for better wages and working conditions.

“It tells immigrant workers that if they speak up, their worst fears will come true,” she said.

99,"Jul 16, 2020",,COVID-19 School Closures Put 30 Million Children at Risk of Hunger,"WASHINGTON, July 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- As COVID-19 infection rates continue to increase in states across the country, many of those jurisdictions are facing the complex dilemma of high infections rates complicating school re-openings and thereby limiting students' access to school-based meal programs. Among the states with spiking infection rates and high percentage of students participating in school-based meal programs are Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina.

In March schools across the country began closing to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In response, and recognizing the important source of nutrition school-based meals were to millions of American children, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service began approving nationwide waivers to provide school systems flexibility in how meals were provided to students. For example, these waivers enable schools to serve meals in non-congregate settings and outside of standard mealtimes, serve afterschool snacks and meals outside of structured environments, and waive requirements that students be present when meals are picked up.

Over half of all students in elementary and secondary schools across the country depend on the National School Lunch Program, and 12.5 million of those students also participate in the School Breakfast Program. As the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools this spring, these students were placed at risk of not having enough to eat.

A new policy brief, Beyond School Walls: How Federal, State and Local Entities are Adapting Policies to Ensure Student Access to Healthy Meals During the COVID-19 Pandemic, released today by Trust for America's Health, reviews steps the federal and state governments have taken to ensure students' access to healthy meals when schools are closed and what needs to be done to ensure continued meal access as all school systems face uncertainties about how to safely reopen for the 2020-2021 school year.

""School meal programs are the most important source of nutritious food for millions of American children. To the degree possible, school systems, with financial and regulatory relief from the federal government, should continue to be innovative about how to deliver meals to students and should strive to meet or exceed federal nutrition standards for these meals despite product shortages created by the pandemic,"" said Adam Lustig, Project Manager at Trust for America's Health and the brief's author.

Due to the economic impact the pandemic has had on millions of American families and the numerous uncertainties about how to safely re-open schools, the currently in place program waivers should be extended through the summer and may need to be kept in place during the 2020–2021 school year, the brief says.

Many of the states hardest hit by COVID also have highest school meal programs participation rates

States with some of the highest rates of COVID-19 infections also have high percentages of students who depend on school meals for much of their nutrition. States in which both COVID-19 infection rates are above national medians and school meals program enrollment is high include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.

States in which more than half of students are enrolled in school-meals programs are:

Percentage of students enrolled in school meal programs

D.C. 76.4% Mississippi 75.0% New Mexico 71.4% South Carolina 67.0% Arkansas 63.6% Louisiana 63.0% Oklahoma 62.5% Georgia 62.0% Nevada 60.8% Kentucky 58.7% California 58.1% Florida 58.1% Arizona 57.0% Missouri 52.7% New York 52.6% Illinois 50.2% Alabama 51.6% Oregon 50.5%

Hunger, poor nutrition and food insecurity can increase a child's risk of developing a range of physical, mental, behavioral, emotional, and learning problems. Hungry children also get sick more often and are more likely to be hospitalized. Maintaining children's access to nutritious meals despite school closures not only ensure they do not go hungry, but also promotes children's health.

""State and federal guidelines waivers have allowed school systems to provide meals to students during the pandemic response, keeping them in place this summer and into the 2020-2021 school year will be the difference between kids who have enough to eat and kids who go hungry,"" Lustig said.

OXFORD, Miss. – As physical distancing to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has transformed the way that Mississippians go to school, do business and care for their neighbors, the North Mississippi VISTA Project is seeking applicants to join efforts to fight poverty in Mississippi through national service.

The North Mississippi VISTA Project has positions for full-time service for summer and yearlong terms of service beginning in June 2020. VISTA members join nonprofit organizations and Title I school districts to support educational attainment, economic opportunity and healthy lifestyles.

While the country practices physical distancing, VISTA members are permitted to support the mission of their host sites through teleservice.

“Already we have seen members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project come forward to support relief efforts in the face of COVID-19,” said Emily Echols, project manager with the University of Mississippi‘s McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement, which leads the North Mississippi VISTA Project.

“From fundraising campaigns to offset the loss of income to working with school districts to deliver school lunches to students living in isolated areas, VISTA members are making a difference for those most at risk of suffering income loss and food insecurity.”

Natural disasters and crises throw the most vulnerable members of society into even more precarious situations. Disparities in income, health status and access to healthy food become more pronounced in emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In such unprecedented times, efforts to alleviate poverty, empower communities and create sustainable solutions are more urgent than ever.

“While VISTA members make a difference at their host sites by increasing the reach of the organization, collectively all members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project are building a better Mississippi,” said Adriana Cooper, VISTA leader. “My time as a VISTA member has permitted me to develop my professional skills while serving my community.”

The North Mississippi VISTA Project needs applicants for summer and full-year terms of service. VISTA summer associates complete 300 hours of direct service to promote literacy and food security over the summer. VISTA members serving yearlong terms help host site organizations by writing grants, developing programs, conducting outreach, managing volunteers and strengthening partnerships.

All VISTA members receive a living allowance of approximately $950 per month and can select either an end-of-service education award of $6,195 ($1,311 for summer associates) or a cash stipend of $1,800 ($311 for summer associates). Members serving a yearlong term also are eligible for a health benefit, a child care benefit and a housing stipend, if offered by their host sites.

“The North Mississippi VISTA Project is central to the McLean Institute’s mission to fight poverty through education in Mississippi,” said Albert Nylander, McLean Institute director and professor of sociology. “Our work is needed now more than ever.”

101,"Apr 23, 2020",Florida Weekly,State farmers adapt as their markets evaporate,"EVA WORDEN IS STARKLY AMBIVALENT THESE DAYS, her gratification following an excellent year mostly joyless, since many of her fellow farmers are now struggling. In the last four weeks, their markets seemed to collapse inward, folding almost without warning like failing parachutes.

Hers didn’t. Neither did many other hyper-local markets across springtime Florida, where small farmers are selling the last of abundant winter produce directly to consumers, people who live within a few miles of the fields where their food is raised and harvested.

But that’s only a tiny portion of traditional demand — of what Florida farmers have become accustomed to growing and selling both within our borders and far beyond.

Here, Florida Weekly looks at the state of agriculture in Florida as spring moves toward summer. We offer a sobering picture, but one with suggestions from farmers and others, those in the business of food distribution, for people who wish to help the agriculture industry or change it, while continuing to eat well.

At the 85-acre Worden Farm in Charlotte County, Mrs. Worden and her husband, Chris Worden, grow organic vegetables for hundreds of customers. Those sign up in advance to get fresh local food in weekly boxes from Worden Farm — in season only — or find it at farmer’s markets now mostly closed, from St. Petersburg to Fort Myers and Naples. Some come to the farm and pick it themselves.

“There is so much difficulty for fellow farmers now because of the sudden change in demand from large-scale buyers — the hospitality industry, schools, cruise lines and others — and we don’t like to see that,” she said.

“But we have done this intense, small-scale farming for almost 20 years because we feel having a direct connection with a customer is essential for regional food security. We don’t feel the (large-scale) way of farming is sustainable.”

Hers is community-supported agriculture, but it represents only a tiny portion of food produced to feed the appetites of Florida and the nation.

In large part, the United States is supplied with many fresh winter vegetables mostly by Florida farmers, who are now under siege.

In a report earlier this month, Gene McAvoy, a several-decades extension agent now serving as associate director of stakeholder relations at the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences — Mr. McAvoy also is president of the National Association of County Extension Agents — painted the dilemma this way, beginning about a month ago.

“On Tuesday, March 24 … everything changed. From brokers, orders stopped and everything got quiet. Wednesday, the 25th, (was) super-quiet.

“Since then tomato volumes are down 85%, green beans 50%, cabbage is (down about) 50%.”

The markets in restaurants and cruise lines dried up all of a sudden, he said: “Four million people in the winter season who eat lavishly three times a day cruise from Miami alone,” he said. “And 120 million tourists per year go to theme parks.”

All that has stopped, taking away markets and dropping prices farmers can get for meat and fish, and destroying markets for fresh produce.

“So if you look at Immokalee, at this time of year in the height of the vegetable season they ship out 400 to 500 semitrucks a day, or 15 to 17 million pounds of vegetables,” he said. “Multiply that by (the produce from) Homestead, Manatee, Ruskin: 50 to 60 million pounds of veggies a day. When the markets suddenly disappear, that throws a wrench into things.”

Farmers under assault

In once case, he reported, “R.C. Hatton has plowed under 100 acres of green beans, around 2 million pounds, and 60 acres of cabbage, or 5 million pounds.”

Paul Allen, a co-owner of the 12,000-acre R.C. Hatton Farms based in Palm Beach County’s Pahokee, on the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, said the loss is unprecedented as a sudden event in March and April, when the growing season usually pays off in product.

But not this year. This year the product is there, but not the pay-off for some vegetables. Crops such as corn or potatoes, which aren’t immediately perishable, or the sugar cane R.C. Hatton produces, can be stored to await a market recovery, if that doesn’t take too long.

Citrus growers are relatively unscathed since the fruit can be processed.

But fresh produce can’t wait.

“We’re harvesting about 50% of our green beans and cabbage — those are basically food-service specific, crops sold in food service like restaurants and hotels, so supermarkets can’t absorb it all,” Mr. Allen explained. “We’re giving all we can to food banks, but people don’t realize how large the food service market is. The food banks aren’t prepared to take it.”

Giving it away isn’t as easy as it sounds, either, simply because harvesting the food — getting it out of the fields, and packaged, then shipped — isn’t easy.

“There’s an associated harvest cost,” Mr. Allen said. “Many times it’s as much as the growing cost. A lot of farmers are harvesting anyway and giving it away to charities because they hate to see it wasted — but you’re losing more money. And you can only go so far with that.”

Mr. Allen and R.C. Hatton, however, along with many other farmers, have already gone a long way with that, according to Karen Erren, executive director of the Palm Beach County Food Bank. There, 66 of the 125 pantries open a year ago have now been closed, while the demand for food (with safe distribution) at each of the remaining 59 has increased between 20% and 60% since last year.

“We were at R.C. Hatton yesterday looking at green beans for the Palm Beach County Food Bank,” Ms. Erren said. “He, like the entire community of growers, is extraordinarily generous. Palm Beach County is the most agriculturally prolific county east of the Mississippi River, and the grower community gives so much. Last fiscal year, I distributed 100,000 pounds of food per week from my food bank, and more than a third, more than 1.5 million pounds, came from our farmers.”

Still, a great deal is wasted, farmers say, because farms with sometimes elaborate infrastructure designed to ship to food service customers aren’t able to make the shift in shipping to other buyers, either quickly or inexpensively. Milk from dairy farms, for example, may customarily go out in 20-gallon containers to food service clients — not in gallon, half-gallon, quart, pint or half-pint containers such as those used in stores or schools. Consequently, the milk may be lost because it’s much more costly to change the shipping infrastructure.

Kim Jamerson, who owns about 1,300 acres in Lee and Hendry counties with her husband, Mike Jamerson, described what happened only four weeks ago, this way:

“The market slowed down, then one day our broker told us to stop picking — so we quit picking for 10 days and abandoned the field. We’re not like a fisherman who could park his boat, get off for 10 days, and then go right back. Down here in the brutal heat and no rain, we lost our crops. We tried to salvage some and couldn’t. One of those is our money field — I call it our money field: We have yellow squash and cucumbers, zucchini, bell pepper and eggplant.”

Americans — Floridians — who might typically seek out those fresh vegetables, now might not since unemployment rates have soared in the state and country. Those shoppers, along with others suddenly more cautious, changed their shopping habits starting in March, buying processed food with longer shelf lives, Mr. McAvoy noted: canned food, rice and beans, cereal and the like.

To complicate the challenge, when farmers like Mr. Allen or the Jamersons stop picking, either they have to continue paying farmworkers brought from Mexico into the country under the H2A program — the Jamersons pay them $9 to $15 an hour depending on the crop, provide workers’ comp and other benefits, Mrs. Jamerson said, which is not the case on many farms — or send them back home.

“We are a food safety-certified farm, we have H2A workers, workman’s comp, we pay top dollar — so even on a good day how can we compete fairly with food shipped across borders from places that don’t have to treat workers that well?

“It’s not a fair fighting field on a good day, and certainly not in a crisis,” she concludes.

The government should step in, buy and store the food, if necessary, and keep American farmers afloat feeding Americans, which also means cutting down on imported food, she insisted, echoing the arguments of others.

If people want to help, “they should call the politicians.”

And last week she did just that, talking with aides in U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s office. They complimented her ideas without agreeing to do anything about them, she acknowledged.

If farmers leave crops in the field simply to rot, or don’t harvest vegetables in time for second-yield plants to produce a new crop, not only is the harvest lost, but the plant can be killed. Then unless it’s all plowed under immediately, the field becomes a magnet of sorts for pests and disease, which in turn affect other crops.

The import problem

Meanwhile, the farmers point out, food keeps coming across U.S. borders in significant quantities — on the order of 200 semitruckloads of various vegetable or fruits per day, said Mr. Allen.

Farmers and brokers can keep track of shipments by watching reports from several sources, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “Specialty Crops Market News” that lists food shipped from within or without U.S. borders, its place of origin, its growing conditions, and its quantity.

A glance at the tomato market, for example, shows the following at www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/wa_ fv454.txt: (amounts are listed as units of 10,000 pounds; a semitruck can carry about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds):

During this 2020 season through April 11, Florida shipped by truck 49,196 of the total 53,484 of U.S. units (4,288 units came from Tennessee).

Mexico had only 1,119 units imported by truck, but added 72,681 units of tomatoes described as “adapted environment;” 3,960 as “controlled environment;” 4,917 as “greenhouse;” and 15,780 as “open field.”

The U.S. had one unit of organic tomatoes — those were from Florida — while Mexico had eight units of organic greenhouse tomatoes and 260 of organic adapted environment tomatoes.

In total, there were 164,564 units listed in a single table by the USDA — there are other tables, too. Less than half came from the U.S., almost all from Florida, where “growers are walking away from big portions of their crops,” Mr. McAvoy reported.

In Mr. Allen’s view, if people want to help farmers, “You should buy American products in your stores … and pray for us.” That also is Mrs. Jamerson’s view, coupled with the notion that the government can do a lot more than it has to protect farmers.

And in Mr. McAvoy’s view, people who want to help should make monetary donations to food banks.

“And some people are, they’re giving to food banks,” he said, “but the food banks are overwhelmed. They don’t have trucks or manpower or the storage space.”

Food banks and new ideas

Food banks have always been part of the industry of agriculture in Florida, both farmers and food bank managers say. But now more than ever that’s true, as huge amounts of fresh produce have become available from Florida fields — available but not necessarily accessible or obtainable, so far.

“This is mostly bad economic news,” explained Richard LeBer, president and CEO of the Harry Chapin Food Bank serving five counties in Southwest Florida.

“Some people are sick, or having to care for kids at home, and they’re on unemployment or reduced income. So, we’ve seen 70 to 80% increases in demand this year from the same period last year. There have been over 24 million unemployment applications in the past few weeks in the nation. And it’s concentrated among certain folks: Retirees are fine, but service industry people are devastated by this.”

They need the food, but neither Harry Chapin nor other nonprofit food banks can store too much of it.

“We’ve seen a substantial increase in demand at our nine food pantries,” said Steve Popper, president and CEO of Meals of Hope, with seven outlets in Collier County and two in Lee.

“So we’ve converted them to drive up pantries for anybody — all you have to do is prove that you live in the county.”

Instead of waiting in line now, people wait in cars. “As they pull up,” Mr. Popper said, “we put food in their cars. We distribute a kit or box of dry items — cereal, canned goods, pasta. In addition, we’re putting in frozen meat of some type, and produce. That’s what we’re doing at all our pantries. We’re giving each person enough food to feed a family for the week.”

And right now, he added, “We’re giving out food to more than 1,500 families each week. In March of last year, it was about 850. If we had additional storage space, we’d be able to give out more than that.”

In an irony of the times — both because of limited storage space for fresh produce and the hugely increased demand — the Harry Chapin Food Bank has been forced to spend more money than ever on nonperishable food.

“In normal times in this region our main suppliers are grocery stores, your Publix or Winn-Dixie, your local Walmart,” Mr. LeBer explained. “They’re constantly turning over stock, so we get the last cans of beans or the 3-day-old steak.

“That works well most of time, but since everybody has cleaned out the grocery stores, that’s been off.

“So now we’re spending a lot of money we normally don’t buying shelf-stable stuff from the manufacturers.”

It’s a cost they can ill afford. “We’re spending $150,000 a week just in the five counties, to buy from wholesalers,” he admitted.

It just might work

But Robin Safley has a plan she hopes to kick off beginning this week that could benefit not only food banks but farmers who don’t want to see their crops turned into dirt, while helping employ people out-of-work.

Executive director of Feeding Florida based in Tallahassee, with 12 food banks around the state affiliated with Farmers Feeding America, Mrs. Safley uses a model called PPO in obtaining food from farmers.

The acronym stands for Pick and Pack Out. Feeding Florida aims to pay for the harvest cost farmers incur in picking and packing out their produce, so they don’t have to plow it under.

“Right now at this time of year Florida is feeding the country — we come into harvest while people elsewhere are still in snow,” she said.

But in the current crisis, “the only way we can make a big difference for Florida growers losing fresh produce is to extend its shelf life,” she said.

In an idea first conceived by her friend John Rivers, owner of 4 Rivers Smokehouse, with restaurants in South Tampa, Kissimmee and Coral Springs, Mrs. Safley may have found a way to do that — and she hopes to test it with one semi-truckload of mixed food, about 40,000 pounds, beginning this week.

“We want to take the product in and convert it to a long shelf life. How? Freeze it? Bring it into a production kitchen and make soups or tomato sauce out of it? Yes. And these ideas have components that employ people. So (John Rivers, who also heads the charitable nonprofit 4R Foundation) has commissary kitchens.”

His and other restaurants, now closed, are a wasted resource unless they can be used, she suggested: “So if I can put product in there and they can make soups or tomato sauce or anything else, that helps growers, it helps restaurants, and it employs people.”

The test run, however, won’t happen at 4 Rivers, it will happen at one of her 12 food banks, the Treasure Coast Food Bank, in St. Lucie County. That one’s equipped with a production kitchen.

“We’re trying to pick up a mitt after the ball’s been thrown,” she said. “So we will start by taking one semiload of fruits and vegetables, and once we’ve run that we’ll do a lot more. We’re working with mixed growers and mixed products.”

She has some big donors and some big trucks, which will allow her to “bring the product out of the field, cut it, dice it, bag it, extend the shelf life, and put it in donated freezers.”

Eventually it can be used by seniors and families in need.

The program is only for Florida growers and Floridians, she said. Farmers who wish to participate may contact one of the following: sherri@feedingflorida.org, or robin@feedingflorida.org.

Mrs. Worden, meanwhile, hopes the current crisis in agriculture and food supply creates “a greater appreciation for regional food security and for a sustainable food system, with farmers and buyers working together.”

Nobody is against that in Florida agriculture, apparently.

“We’ve long believed that having food as a centerpiece of your home life and activities can have a positive influence on your physical and emotional health,” she added. “You can become more grounded in the biological process of what it means to be alive.

“Health is wealth and food is the basis of health. The way we choose to feed ourselves can have an effect on our own organisms, in our eco-systems, and from there it has an impact on air and water and the global system.”

And one other thing. “Some people may begin to feel invincible, as though we are not a vulnerable species. We are vulnerable. But sustainable food as a solution to health — as a positive choice — is within our reach.” ¦","But that’s only a tiny portion of traditional demand — of what Florida farmers have become accustomed to growing and selling both within our borders and far beyond.
In large part, the United States is supplied with many fresh winter vegetables mostly by Florida farmers, who are now under siege.
“And 120 million tourists per year go to theme parks.”All that has stopped, taking away markets and dropping prices farmers can get for meat and fish, and destroying markets for fresh produce.
“And some people are, they’re giving to food banks,” he said, “but the food banks are overwhelmed.

The Republic | azcentral.com

JACKSON — White supremacist ideology is helping fuel domestic terrorism in the United States, the head of Homeland Security said Tuesday.

Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan appeared in Jackson, Mississippi, for a forum about preventing violence against religious groups. The conversation included references to mass shootings, including the recent one that killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso.

Authorities in Texas say the white man charged in the shooting told police he was targeting Mexicans.

""The attack in El Paso and the violent white supremacist ideology that inspired it offends us all,"" McAleenan said Tuesday. ""We must address it with moral clarity, this hate that is domestic terrorism, and it must be resisted together by Americans of all races, ethnicities and faiths.""

Others at the forum described the threat in similar terms.

""Racism is a national security threat,"" said Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee.

Critics of President Donald Trump contend his language has stoked racial and ethnic divisions. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi did not name names but said ""the racist, xenophobic language that we hear coming from high places"" empowers people ""to do crazy things.""

Tremendous fear: El Paso shooting heightens fear of daily life for Latinos in Mississippi

Thompson and Jackson Lee also criticized raids last week in which 680 Hispanic immigrants were arrested at food processing plants in Mississippi, the largest workplace sting in the U.S. in at least a decade.

""Last week's massive ICE raid will have an enormous long-term effect on the state of Mississippi,"" Thompson said. ""I do not understand why ICE picked this time, right after the country was healing from the targeted attack on Mexicans, to perform these raids in this community. ICE turned the first day of school, a special day that is to be filled with smiles and happiness, into a fearful memory for many of the children in Mississippi.""

McAleenan told NBC on Sunday that the timing of the raids was ""unfortunate,"" but the action had been planned for more than a year.

Jackson Lee said Tuesday that racists who target Hispanics or other people of color can be bolstered by the workplace raid.

""They see a brown person and they see the government rounding up and they're saying, 'That's what I should be doing, but I won't round up. I will kill,'"" Jackson Lee said.

McAleenan said that domestic terrorism, whether at houses of worship or other places, ""has a broad and expansive impact on American citizens and our national climate.""

""These attacks not only end lives, they also degrade our society and diminish the integrity of our national values,"" McAleenan said. ""They pull at our civic seams and our diverse country and they challenge citizens' faith in their government's ability to protect them. Domestic terrorism jeopardizes both our physical security and our perceptions of security.""

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Staff members within Mississippi State’s Office of Financial Aid led a team effort to help students in need of food items and other basic supplies, and their effort culminated this week with a donation to Bully’s Closet and Pantry.

Director of Financial Aid Paul McKinney said his staff has been meeting weekly on WebEx, and they decided during one of these online discussions to help students facing a difficult time.

“The Financial Aid office works with needy students everyday helping them bridge their financial gap to ensure their ability to attend college and be successful. However, the staff wanted to do something more for our students, and they really pulled together to make this happen,” McKinney said. “To be able to do something for them during a time of need is such a blessing.”

The Office of Financial Aid reached out to include other units within MSU’s Enrollment Services, including Account Services, Admissions and Scholarships, the Office of the Registrar, and Orientation and Events. Then, staff members spread the word to family, friends and neighbors about the collection, which they carried out while observing social distancing.

“We all worked together to make this successful,” McKinney said. The result was a truck bed full of items donated to Bully’s Closet and Pantry, which opened in January as a resource for nutritious food, professional clothing, toiletries and other basic items. Students may pick up items for free at the 120 Morgan Ave. location and only need to present their MSU I.D. card. A collaborative effort between the university’s Division of Student Affairs and the Student Association, Bully’s Closet and Pantry is part of the MSU Food Security Network, a broader initiative to meet students’ basic needs throughout their time at the state’s leading university.

104,"Jun 9, 2020",CNN,Groceries were hard to find for millions. Now it's getting even worse,"New York (CNN Business) The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and limited delivery slots for online groceries.

But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

In 2015, an estimated 39 million people, or 12.8% of the US population, lived in ""low income and low access areas,"" according to the USDA's most recent data

The areas are defined as those where a ""significant"" portion of the population lives more than a mile from the nearest supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles away in rural areas. The poverty rate is either 20% or greater, or the median-family income is below or equal to 80% of the statewide median family income.

Such areas are commonly known as food deserts, even though the term has no official meaning. it's increasingly difficult for the people who live in them to buy food.

During the pandemic, grocers have cut back their operating hours. Public transportation has been reduced, and riders who once traveled to stores in other neighborhoods or cities can no longer do so. Some older or higher-risk populations are fearful of traveling during the pandemic.

There's also evidence that food accessibility challenges are growing. In Georgia, the number of residents now living in ""food insecure"" areas has jumped 69% since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data firm Urban Footprint. The firm uses an index, including jobless claims, pre-existing health conditions, and access to grocery stores and healthy food, to measure food security — or ""reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritionally adequate food.""

In Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky the number of residents living in food insecure areas has spiked 43%, 36% and 118% respectively, driven by the rise in unemployment, according to the analysis

The pandemic has made it ""very cumbersome"" to buy groceries, said Yolanda Jackson, who lives 1.6 miles from her nearest grocery store in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2018, 23.5% of Baltimore residents lived in an area where access to healthy food is limited.

Jackson usually takes the bus to Shoppers grocery store, but stopped during the pandemic in part because of the long waits. She has been going to corner stores and bodegas ""where the selections are low and the prices are high,"" she said.

Online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who rely on food stamps.

s minorities. The problem of food access disproportionately affectminorities. Research from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that lower-income minority neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores compared with similar white neighborhoods.

""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data.

'Online grocery shopping is not equal'

Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce, public health experts say.

Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.

""With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than processed items,"" said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes.

During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online.

Amazon AMZN Walmart WMT In states that do allow recipients to use their benefits online, their options are usually onlyor, which have gaps in where they deliver groceries to customers' home. And some deliveries have minimum purchase requirements or added shipping fees, which can be a barrier for low-income customers.

""Access to online grocery shopping is not equal,"" said Caitlin Caspi, assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Rep. Sanford Bishop, chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Subcommittee, wrote to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue last week urging the department to expand the number of grocers eligible to participate in the online program. ""Of the approved retailers, only two are national chains and only one of the national retailers can reach our most rural communities,"" Bishop said.

As food access challenges swell during the pandemic, cities, food banks, schools and community organizations are trying to find creative solutions.

""The public school system and many charter and private schools are continuing to offer meals to children and some of our urban farmers and chefs are teaming up to make meals for people in their neighborhoods who are in need of food,"" said Winona Bynum from the Detroit Food Policy Council.

In Baltimore, the city has developed an emergency response strategy. It's working to expand residents' participation in the food stamp program, which allows for online purchasing in the state of Maryland. The city has also ramped up delivering boxes of shelf-stable groceries and produce to residents' homes.","But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

105,"Nov 8, 2019",,Update on girl whose father was detained during Mississippi ICE raid,"MISSISSIPPI - Magdalena Gomez Gregorio hugged her father for the first time in months after she tearfully begged in front of reporters for his release following a massive immigration sweep in Mississippi.

Her father, Andres Gomez-Jorge, was released from immigration detention last week after relatives and friends raised funds to pay his $7,500 bond.

His daughter's voice was heard around the world in a video that went viral after immigration authorities rounded up hundreds of undocumented workers at several Mississippi food processing plants in early August.

""I need my dad. ... He's not a criminal,"" Magdalena said, sobbing as she waited with other children at a local gym that offered food and shelter on the day of the raids to children whose parents had been taken.

Gomez-Jorge had been working at the Morton Koch Foods plant in Morton, Mississippi when the raids occurred. His wife, Juana, who asked to be identified only by her first name out of fear for her family's safety, didn't sleep for days while waiting for word about her husband.

Now, the couple and their four children are ""extremely happy"" to be reunited but are unsure of what their future holds.

""I don't know what I will do. I don't know what will happen,"" Gomez-Jorge said, when asked about his plans.

He has not received a court date just yet and is struggling to find work. He wants to work in construction but he says jobs are scarce because it is starting to get cold.

Because Gomez-Jorge brings in all the income and is currently unemployed, the family of six has been surviving on donations of food and money.

No charges against employers

Three months after the raids, there are still no charges filed against any of the owners or companies involved in employing the more than 650 undocumented workers that were detailed after the raids.

Affidavits made public after the historic August 7 raids showed federal agents suspected that the food processing plants unlawfully hired undocumented workers.

On Thursday, several Democratic lawmakers from the House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security questioned an ICE official at a hearing Mississippi, and pressed him to explain why no employers have faced charges.

Jere Miles, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations' New Orleans office, told committee members that no employers had been arrested as a result of the raids, noting that the investigation was ongoing.

Investigators seized 850,000 documents and 22 terabytes of information, he said.

Two of the raided chicken processing plants have said they followed local and federal laws and participated in E-Verify, which is used to confirm employment eligibility for workers. Officials at two other plants did not respond to CNN's previous requests for comment.

""As I'm assuming all of you understand, it is a lengthy process to build a criminal prosecution,"" noting that executing search warrants is ""not the final step.""

""Seven months from now or a year from now when we finalize the investigation,"" he said, ""there will be nobody thanking us for it.""

That explanation didn't sit well with Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas.

""You knew before you came that laws were being broken, but you picked on the undocumented person to the exclusion of the employers,"" Green said. ""This is not the way we treat people in the United States of America.""

Dozens of workers have been been indicted on charges ranging from illegal reentry to misuse of social security numbers, according to court documents.","MISSISSIPPI - Magdalena Gomez Gregorio hugged her father for the first time in months after she tearfully begged in front of reporters for his release following a massive immigration sweep in Mississippi.

106,"Dec 15, 2020",Truthout,54 Million Americans Are Projected to Be Food Insecure by End of Year,"As autumn fades and winter looms, the dire predictions public-health experts made about Covid-19 have, unfortunately, proven all-too-accurate. On October 27th, 74,379 people were infected in the United States; less than a month and a half later, on December 9th, that number had soared to 218,677, while the 2020 total has just surpassed 15 million, a number no other country, not even India, which has a population three times that of the U.S., has surpassed.

And now, it seems, the third wave of the virus has arrived. As recently as late October, the embattled Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, warned that “we are in for a whole lot of hurt” and that infections could reach 100,000 a day. As it happens, he was wildly optimistic. A little more than a month later, there were more than twice that many. Is it possible, however, that the current surge is due in part to increased testing, as President Trump and others have regularly claimed? Here’s the problem. Even if that theory were true, it can’t account for the spiraling death toll, which is now more than 300,000 and could hit 450,000 by February, according to Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nor can it explain the daily Covid-19 hospitalizations, the first round of which peaked at 59,712 on July 23rd, dropped pretty steadily to a low of 28,606 on September 20th, and then started to soar, reaching 106,671 on December 9th.

Though big-picture statistics like these should help us grasp the staggering magnitude of our current public-health crisis, what they don’t reveal is the searing effects it’s had on the lives of millions of Americans, even those who have managed to evade the virus or haven’t seen friends or family fall ill or die from Covid-19. The pandemic has been especially hard for those on the front lines: doctors, nurses, and other hospital workers who experience battle fatigue and despair while besieged by suffering and deaths, visceral reminders of their own vulnerability.

In society at large, precautions — lockdowns, social distancing, limits on festive gatherings — necessary to keep Covid-19 at bay have increased loneliness and social isolation. Contrary to early expectations, reports of abuse and violence within families haven’t actually spiraled, but experts suggest that may be because the victims, confined to their homes alongside their tormentors, are finding it harder to seek help and fear reporting what’s happening to them. As for children, teachers are no longer seeing their pupils in person as regularly and so are less able to spot the typical warning signs of mistreatment.

Thankfully, the pandemic has yet to increase this country’s already alarming suicide rate, but the same can’t be said for levels of stress and depression, both of which have risen noticeably. School closures and the move to online learning have forced parents, particularly women, to scramble for childcare and to work less, even though many of them were barely getting by while working full-time, or stop working altogether, often a genuine disaster in poor families.

Not surprisingly, people who have been laid off or had their work hours reduced have fallen behind on their mortgage and rent payments. Although various federal and state moratoriums on such payments, as well as on evictions and foreclosures, were enacted, such protections will eventually end. And the moratoriums don’t negate renters’ or homeowners’ obligations to settle accounts with their bankers and landlords somewhere down the line (which for many Americans may, in the end, prove an impossibility).

Food and the Pandemic

Apart from the illness and death it causes, perhaps the most poignant consequence of Covid-19 has been the way it’s increased what’s called “food insecurity” across the United States. That ungainly term doesn’t refer to the chronic food scarcity and undernourishment, which afflicts more than 800 million people in poor countries, but rather to the disruption of people’s typical food-consumption patterns. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) distinguishes between what it calls low food security (“reduced quality, variability, or desirability of diet”) and the very low version of the same (“multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake”).

Surveys by the USDA and the Census Bureau show that both variants have risen steeply during the pandemic. Just before the coronavirus struck, 35 million Americans, 11 million of them children, experienced food insecurity, the lowest figure in two decades. This year, those numbers are projected to reach 54 million and 18 million respectively. In 2018, 4% of American adults reported that at least some members of their family did not have enough to eat; by July 2020, that figure had hit 11%, according to a study by Northwestern University’s Food Research and Action Center, and will only increase as the pandemic worsens.

Income supplements provided by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act that Congress passed in March in response to the economic problems created by Covid-19, increases in the government’s Supplementary Nutritional Program (SNAP), and the Pandemic Electronic Benefit (P-EBT), which helps parents whose children no longer get free or subsidized school lunches, have made a difference — but not enough to make up for lost or reduced income, lost homes, and other disasters of this moment. And sadly, any follow-up to the CARES Act, assuming Congress reaches some kind of agreement on its terms before the current legislation expires at the end of December, will almost certainly be far less generous than the original law. The SNAP increases already excluded the poorest seven million households that were then receiving the maximum amount, and the new increases now under discussion in Congress would add less than one dollar to a four-person family’s maximum daily benefit. P-EBT expired in most states at the end of September, in some as early as July.

That food insecurity has “skyrocketed,” as the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities puts it, during the pandemic despite government assistance shouldn’t come as a surprise. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Some have seen their earnings diminished because of furloughs, wage cuts, freezes, or reduced working hours. Others have looked for jobs in vain and finally given up (but aren’t included in official unemployment statistics). Millions of adults have children who no longer receive those free or subsidized lunches because of the switch, in whole or part, to online teaching. Worse yet, as pandemic-induced firings, layoffs, and wage cuts have reduced incomes, and so consumer purchasing power, food prices, especially for meat, fish, and eggs, have only risen. Such costs have increased for other reasons as well. The pandemic has disrupted supply networks, national and international. Leery consumers, anticipating shortages or seeking to reduce trips to grocery stores to avoid being infected by Covid-19, have also resorted to panic buying and the stockpiling of food and other necessities.

Who You Are and Where You Live Matters Most

Of course, not everyone has been hit with equal force by rising food prices. Americans high on the income ladder can absorb such extra costs easily enough and, in any case, spend a substantially smaller portion of their income on groceries. According to the USDA, adults with incomes in the top fifth of society spent 8% of their income on food last year; for the bottom fifth, it was 36%. The first group also obviously has a lot more money available to stock up on food than that bottom fifth, so many of whom have also become jobless or seen their paychecks diminish since the pandemic started. In March, for example, 39% of those making less than $40,000 had already lost their jobs or had their paychecks reduced, but only 13% of those who earned $100,000 or more, and that gap continued into the fall.

Not surprisingly, then, the bigger the hit people took from the Covid-19 recession, the more likely they were to experience food insecurity, which is why aggregate statistics on the phenomenon and other societal problems attributable to the pandemic can be misleading. They tend to mask the reality that its effects have been felt primarily by the most vulnerable, while the others have been touched much more lightly, or not at all.

The variations are rooted in ethnicity and location as well as income level (and the three tend to be closely linked). A USDA report classified 19% of Black households and 16% of Hispanic households as food insecure in 2019, compared to 8% of their white counterparts. By this summer, food insecurity had increased significantly across the board, afflicting 36% of Black, 32% of Hispanic, and 18% of white households. While the pandemic has certainly made matters worse, African Americans had the highest rate among those three groups even before it started. This was especially true of counties — the U.S. has more than 3,000 of them — in which they were in the majority. In 2016, those particular counties accounted for a mere 3% of the national total, but 96% of them had “high food insecurity,” as the Department of Agriculture defines it, as well as a poverty rate more than twice the national average (12.7% that year).

Native Americans have had the worst of it, however, since many of their families lack access to running water and plumbing (58 per 1,000 households compared to three per 1,000 for whites). Nearly 75% of Native Americans must travel more than a mile to reach a supermarket, compared to 40% of the population as a whole, and the disruption of supply chains has only diminished their food security further relative to other ethnic communities. Even prior to the pandemic, counties in which they (or Native Alaskans) constituted a majority were among those with the highest levels of food insecurity. Not coincidentally, in 2016, the poverty rate in nearly 70% of Native American-majority counties averaged a whopping 37%.

In other words, while every group has suffered in this pandemic year, race matters — a lot — when it comes to the degree of suffering.

So does income. In coronavirus-stricken America, only 1% of adults with an annual income exceeding $100,000 surveyed by the Census Bureau this summer responded that, during the preceding week, their household “sometimes or often did not have enough to eat.” Compare that to 16% of those making $25,000-$35,000 and 28% of those earning less than $25,000.

Finally, food insecurity during the pandemic has varied by location as well. Ten states (and the District of Columbia) had the highest rates, ranging from Mississippi (33.5%), which stood atop this group, to Alabama (27%), which had the lowest. In between, in descending order, were Washington, D.C., Nevada, Louisiana, New York, New Mexico, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

Food Banks and Pantries: On the Front Lines

The other day, a close friend described to me the daily scene at a food distribution center in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood. Well before trucks laden with food pulled up early in the morning, he said, the lines had already started forming, hundreds of people waiting patiently in a queue that encircled the block. And that’s just one of many neighborhoods in New York where this is all too typical these days. In Queens, for instance, one pantry regularly faces a demand so steep that lines can extend for eight blocks. Try to imagine what the waiting time must be. All told, 1.5 million people in the city, unable to buy the groceries they need, rely on food pantries, and New York is anything but unusual. Photographs abound of cars lined up by the hundreds, even thousands, at food pantries in major cities around the country.

Feeding America, a non-profit organization that supports 200 food storage centers and 60,000 pantries nationwide, reports that the country’s food banks have provided the equivalent of more than 4.2 billion meals since March, a 50% increase compared to a year ago and 40% of the people who come to such pantries are first-time visitors. A Consumer Reports survey of grocery shoppers found that nearly a fifth of them had turned to a food pantry since the pandemic began (half of whom hadn’t sought such help at all in 2019). In March, before the first wave of Covid-19 began to peak, 18 million Americans already used food pantries; by August, that number had climbed to 22 million, even though an additional 6.2 million people had received benefits from SNAP (the food-stamp program in common parlance) between March and May alone. By early July, 37.4 million people had signed up for SNAP compared to 35.7 million for all of last year.

Little wonder, then, that food banks, facing a tsunami of demand, have struggled to stay stocked amid rising prices, shortages, reduced donations from big chain supermarkets, and disrupted supply chains. It’s also become even harder for them to raise the money they need to operate. Not a few have buckled under the strain and many have been forced to shut down. Pantries have also had a hard time mustering volunteers, in part because seniors, particularly vulnerable to the virus, made up a significant segment of such helpers. Not surprisingly, then, food banks and pantries have battled to function or simply survive in these months, while also having to implement an array of cumbersome and costly safety measures to keep volunteers, staff, and clients infection-free.

Despite their heroic role, such food banks and pantries are the equivalent of the proverbial finger in the dike. For Covid-induced food insecurity and hunger to decline significantly, the third wave of infections will have to subside and Congress will have to offer more effective aid. The Trump administration’s recent proposal, blessed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to provide a one-shot $600 check to all adults (whether they’re unemployed or not) certainly isn’t. At the same time, vaccines will have to be produced in sufficient quantities and distributed rapidly. (We are far from ready on that front.) All this in a country where striking numbers of people look askance at vaccination — in a December survey only 63% of Americans said they would be willing to get vaccinated against Covid-19 — and are also drawn to conspiracy mongers whose appeal has grown, thanks in part to social media.

Once the virus is vanquished or at least brought under reasonable control, the economy can be reopened. Then, many of the nearly 11 million at-present unemployed people will perhaps have a shot at working again or having their employers end reduced hours and cut wages.

Here’s hoping that these various stars align by summer 2021. We can then revert to pre-pandemic normalcy, even though that state of affairs was marked by substantial poverty — 34 million people last year — and rising inequality.

“I appreciate Dean Kent Hoblet and our world-class CVM faculty and researchers for their leadership and mentorship of these two outstanding veterinary students,” said Keenum, a former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has made food security a central focus of his professional life.

Barber is being mentored by Dr. Amelia Woolums, a professor in CVM’s Department of Pathobiology and Population Medicine. Woolums is board-certified in internal medicine and veterinary microbiology. Barber, a 2019 MSU CVM Bardsley Scholarship recipient, is focusing her research on alternatives to antibiotics in treating bacterial and viral diseases in livestock.

Lucas’s research focuses on developing system dynamics modeling to reduce antimicrobial use in the cattle industry. His mentor is Dr. David Smith, a board-certified veterinary epidemiologist and CVM’s Mikell and Mary Cheek Hall Davis Endowed Professor for Beef Cattle Health and Reproduction.

“Cassandra and Alec have completed their first year in the CVM curriculum and are currently participating in the college’s Summer Research Experience Program. Both have already shown themselves to be excellent students,” Hoblet said. “Both Amelia and Dave are fantastic teachers, researchers and mentors, and we are grateful to them as well for all they have done and will continue to do to advance our program.”

STARKVILLE, Miss.—As Mississippi State’s nearly 1,600 newest graduates celebrate their milestone accomplishments at commencement ceremonies in Humphrey Coliseum today [Nov. 25], MSU President Mark E. Keenum is applauding their abilities to adapt and overcome challenges.

“We’ve made it through this most challenging of years together,” he said. “All of you have overcome so much to get here today.”

Keenum spoke by video to graduates from the university’s eight colleges across the day’s four graduation events. He said contact tracing showed he had been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, thus necessitating his change of plans for attending the celebrations in person. Keenum said he is well but has not completed his quarantine period.

“Now more than ever, a college degree and all that you have learned here will help you succeed in a world that is undergoing unprecedented change. I also believe that the timeless values we hold dear as members of the Mississippi State University family will serve you well—you will need integrity; you will need to work hard; you will need to show respect for others,” Keenum said.

He added that “considering our current pandemic situation, there is another value that is also very important—courage.”

In his 12th year of tenure, Keenum is a three-time MSU graduate with degrees in agricultural economics. The former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has guided the university to unprecedented heights, and his interest in international food security has strengthened the university’s contributions to global economic sustainability. He has led MSU to record growth in enrollment, capital improvements and fundraising. Keenum and other university leaders were commended recently by a resolution of MSU’s Robert Holland Faculty Senate for “exemplary transparency and cooperation, their tenacity and flexibility, and their courage and grace in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic so as to minimize medical danger and consequences for faculty, staff and students alike, and to successfully continue the educational, research and service missions of the university during this unprecedented crisis.”

By Tamara Sandberg, Advisor, U.S. Food Security & Nutrition

For more than a decade, child hunger in America was trending in a positive direction: down. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the number of households with children that reported struggling with food security was steadily decreasing since the Great Recession, dropping to a two-decade low of 13.6 percent in 2019. Alarmingly, child hunger has skyrocketed across the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic. New research from Northwestern University underscores a heartbreaking reality. Since March, food insecurity rates have tripled for families with children across the nation and are disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic families.

One child struggling with hunger is one too many. Before the pandemic closed schools, Save the Children supported kids through early education programs across rural America. Visits to these programs make clear that child hunger is pervasive in rural America. Pre-pandemic, nearly 90 percent of the nation’s counties with the highest rates of child food insecurity were rural. In California’s Central Valley, the Mississippi Delta, or in my backyard in Appalachia, kids often sprint off the school bus in the morning, making a beeline to the cafeteria for the free breakfast served at school. Getting nutritious meals to children outside school buildings proved one of the biggest challenges to overcome during widespread school closures this spring.

Organizations including Save the Children, food banks, and community and faith-based groups rose to the occasion and worked tirelessly to meet the urgent need of hungry kids. In fact, Save the Children helped prepare and deliver nearly 9 million meals across rural America since schools were shuttered to ensure kids weren’t missing out. That number continues to grow as remote and hybrid learning models carry on during the pandemic.

But we can’t rely on nonprofits and generous individuals alone to fill the food gap. Specific, focused investment at the federal and state level is essential to ensure children do not continue to go hungry. The federal government must approve a 15 percent boost in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and increase the minimum monthly benefit to $30 as part of the solution. We need Congress to take action and put resources directly and immediately into American’s wallets. Every SNAP dollar spent generates about $1.54 in economic activity, so this investment helps local communities and economies, too.

SNAP is critical for helping children grow and helps break the cycle of poverty. Meeting children’s basic nutritional needs helps ensure they are healthier and better able to succeed in school. When children grow up smarter, stronger and healthier, our nation is smarter, stronger and healthier, too. Elected officials, please join us in strengthening our children’s futures. We need your leadership and commitment to ensure every child has a strong, healthy life.","Nourish the Nation by Combatting Child HungerBy Tamara Sandberg, Advisor, U.S. Food Security & NutritionFor more than a decade, child hunger in America was trending in a positive direction: down.

110,"May 3, 2019",Jackson Free Press,Mississippi Women Could Benefit Most from Lift on SNAP Ban," Mississippi women stand to gain the most now that the U.S. government will no longer be able to bar state residents with felony drug convictions from receiving federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.



Congress passed the ban in a 1996 welfare reform bill but offered states the option to opt out. The Mississippi Legislature opted out of those prohibitions in March, leaving them in place in just one state, South Carolina. West Virginia opted out of the ban earlier this year. The ban included the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program.

The prohibitions disproportionately affect low,-income women and people of color, said Madeline Morcelle, a staff attorney at the Mississippi Center for Justice who focuses on food security issues. Women lead men when it comes to disqualifying felony drug convictions. On top of that, she said, women, especially single mothers, are most likely to experience hunger.

""We know that women overall access SNAP at higher rates because of that situation, so lifting the ban will secure access to those who were disproportionately in need,"" she said.

Morcelle pointed to ""systemic"" causes and ""historical injustices,"" like redlining and segregation, that she says are to blame for the federal law's impact on African Americans.

""So both of these populations will realize significant gains in food security because of this policy change,"" she said.

As the Legislature debated Mississippi's new Criminal Justice Reform Act earlier this year, Republican state Sen. Sally Doty pushed her colleagues to include a lift on the ban—which did not include violent felons.

""I saw no reason to treat drug felons differently than those with violent offenses,"" the Brookhaven senator told the Associated Press on May 2. ""And the ban had a larger effect on women, who generally have lower-paying jobs and could greatly benefit from the education and training programs, as well as the nutritional support. The overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities.""

Morcelle, similarly, told the Jackson Free Press that lifting the ban could help reduce recidivism rates. More than 90% of people experience hunger within their first year of exiting the criminal justice system, she said. Access to SNAP would not only help alleviate hunger issues, she said, but would make re-entry easier through the job training programs it offers.

The Mississippi Center for Justice's website notes that women are more likely to receive a drug-related conviction than men, and that most women with drug-related felonies have children.

The ban could also prevent family reunification between parents and children post-incarceration, the center notes, but lifting the ban could also help reduce recidivism rates, and lower costs to the foster care and the criminal justice systems.

Because food assistance programs like SNAP and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)

The lift on the food assistance ban is part of the larger criminal justice reform package the Legislature passed in March and that Gov. Phil Bryant then signed into law. It also expands drug courts, ends the practice of automatically suspending driver's licenses for simple drug possession charges or failure to pay fines, and includes other provisions to help with employment opportunities post-release.

The Criminal Justice Reform Act goes into effect on July 1, 2019. The Jackson Free Press could not reach Doty's office for comment by press time.

111,"Sep 9, 2020",Agri-Pulse,US food insecurity fell ahead of pandemic,"Food insecurity in the United States dropped again in 2019 ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has cost millions of Americans their jobs and continues to send many into food lines, the Agriculture Department reported Wednesday.

According to USDA’s annual survey of U.S. hunger, which was conducted last December, 10.5% of U.S. households, or 13.7 million, were food insecure in 2019, meaning that their access to food was limited by lack of money and other resources.

That rate was down from the 2011 high of 14.9% and well below the pre-recession level of 11.1% in 2007.

Rates of food insecurity are substantially higher than the national average for several groups, including households headed by Blacks (19.1%), Hispanics (15.6%) and single women (28.7%).

Some 15.4% of households headed by men were food insecure in 2019, and women and men living alone had rates of 13% and 12.8% respectively.

While the 2020 food insecurity rates won’t be released for another year, participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program jumped from 37 million in March to 43 million in April, the latest month for which USDA has released data. That doesn’t capture the number of people who have received help through food banks and other feeding programs and may be ineligible for SNAP.

According to a recent Census Bureau survey of households, 22.4 million adults reported that their household didn’t get enough to eat in the last seven days.

Some 4.1% of all U.S .households, about 5.3 million, were classified in a more severe category known as “very low food security,” which means that food intake of some household members was reduced and their normal eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year.

There was no statistically significant difference between the 2019 rate for that more severe category of food insecurity and the 2018 rate of 4.3%.

Children were food insecure at times during 2019 in 6.5% of the U.S. households that have children. That rate was not statistically different from the 2018 rate of 7.1%.

USDA economists report rates of food insecurity for individual states on a three-year rolling average, 2017-2019, and Mississippi continues to have the highest rate at 15.7%, followed by West Virginia (15.4%), Louisiana (15.3%), New Mexico (15.1%) and Oklahoma (14.7%).

New Hampshire has the lowest rate at 6.6%, followed by New Jersey (7.7%), Iowa (7.9%) and Minnesota and North Dakota, each with a rate of 8.3%.

Winner—“Community Drum Circles,” submitted by Robert Damm, MSU professor of music. This project encourages meaningful collaborations among MSU faculty, staff and students and those with special needs in the state through drum circle programs and other rhythm-based activities. Since 2014, 64 drum circles have helped an estimated 3,010 people with increased self-awareness and self-esteem, peer acknowledgement, enhanced listening, communication and teamwork skills, and more. This also has facilitated knowledge-sharing through scholarly publication and conference presentation. Four articles have appeared in the peer-reviewed Percussive Notes journal that is made available to 6,000 members. Two clinics and two Rhythm Discovery Day sessions for a national conference with 6,000 attendees, and two Percussive Arts Society Day of Percussion facilitations in Mississippi have led to peer recognition resulting in election to the PAS national-level committee on interactive drumming. Damm’s work in drum circles also continues to inform his teaching and scholarship, including articles on drumming's positive effects on children with autism and the benefits of drum circles for students.

Honorable Mention—“Home, Place and Mississippi: A Cultural Diversity Literacy Project,” submitted by Qiana Cutts. This project focuses on literacy enhancement for high school and university students of various racial identities majoring in English or English/Language Arts Secondary Education.

113,"Oct 4, 2019",WIAT - CBS42.com,"Alabama among the poorest, hungriest states in country, according to report","BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WIAT) — A report by the the Quaker group Friends Committee on National Legislation ranked Alabama among both the poorest and hungriest states in the country.

The report, which came out last week, grouped Alabama with other states to be included as both among the poorest and the most hungry. Other states on the report included Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Kentucky and West Virginia.

The report for the most hungry states came from data collected from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service’s 2018 report “Household Food Security in the United States.” In that report, 14.7% of Alabama’s population was not food secure.

For the poorest states, the report cited information from the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau survey, which stated that Alabama’s poverty rate was 16.8% as of the survey.

“There is much welcome news in the latest government data, but we cannot ignore the fact that hunger and poverty persist in our country. These decreases are important and they reaffirm the vital role federal anti-poverty programs play in ensuring low-income Americans can obtain the benefits that help meet our basic human needs,” said Diane Randall, executive secretary for FCNL, in a written statement. “As Quakers, we believe that no one in this country should be hungry and suffer from want.”

114,"Nov 7, 2019",Border Report,House Democrat criticizes Mississippi chicken plant raids,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — It’s “disappointing” that President Donald Trump’s administration is selectively enforcing laws to apprehend immigrant workers who are in the U.S. illegally but not prosecute employers, a U.S. House committee chairman said Thursday.

Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and House Homeland Security Committee chairman, made the criticism during a hearing about federal immigration raids in August at seven Mississippi chicken processing plants where agents arrested 680 mostly Guatemalan workers.

“Not one employer or person from management has been arrested,” Thompson said. “In fact, prosecutions of companies who hire undocumented workers have declined compared to the previous administration’s numbers. The selective way the administration is enforcing our laws is disappointing.”

Mike Hurst, chief federal prosecutor for the southern half of Mississippi, said Thursday that 119 people have been indicted after the raid and 47 have pleaded guilty so far. Of those, Hurst said 26 have pleaded guilty to fraudulently using a Social Security number, while 21 others have pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after previously being deported. The rest face some combination of those charges.

Jere Miles, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, pleaded for patience, saying agents are examining 850,000 documents and 61 digital devices to build cases.

“We’re not satisfied with going after the low-level people, but as I’m sure you all understand, it is a lengthy process,” Miles testified.

The Democrats called the arrests unnecessary, inhumane and demeaning, with U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee saying she would push for a law against separating parents and children because of immigration enforcement.

“I believe we should clarify that there is no policy, no dictate, that directs ICE and any other agency, no law to separate families from children,” the Texas Democrat told reporters.

She and others called it a waste of resources to bring in 600 federal agents to arrest 680 people. Thompson said just agents’ wages for the day cost $478,000.

Witnesses said federal agents failed to coordinate with local authorities to make sure children wouldn’t return home to empty houses, saying children remain traumatized, especially because many parents are still in detention.

“The trauma of these children is too painful,” testified the Rev. Odel Medina, pastor of St. Anne Catholic Church in Carthage “They do not understand why their parents have been arrested.'”

Miles called it an “oversight” that some school districts weren’t contacted, and told reporters later that “I think that there are lessons that need to be learned.” But he also pushed back against the idea that people who violate immigration laws should be treated differently from other criminals.

“Like anyone who gets arrested for a crime in the United States, they can’t go home,” Miles testified. He echoed top Homeland Security officials who say arresting people working illegally in the United States is important because it will cut off the incentive for others to come.

“When we take some of the economic incentive away, it is going to have an impact,” Miles testified.

Witnesses also questioned federal prosecutors’ decision to indict so many people. Cliff Johnson, a University of Mississippi law professor and former assistant U.S. attorney, said prosecutors take some cases and decline others daily, and that what prosecutors were doing in Mississippi is “wrongheaded.”

“These people are not criminals …,” Johnson testified. “Many of them are young mothers with a third-grade education or less, who themselves have been victimized by crimes. There are only a handful that have even a misdemeanor conviction.”

Hurst, though, defended the prosecutions.

“Turning a blind eye to their illegal acts would not be fair to our nation, their victims, or the millions of naturalized American citizens who waited years and meticulously followed the process by which to become an American,” he said in a statement.

Thompson and other Democrats promise legislative action, but it seems unlikely to arrive in time to help those facing criminal charges or deportation.

“We’re not going to stop speaking until we have a way to citizenship that allows us to contribute to this country with peace and tranquility,” said one woman who was arrested, who would only give her name as Lorena, citing fear that speaking up could worsen her legal troubles.","This young woman cries while standing outside the Koch Foods Inc., plant as U.S. immigration officials raid the plant in Morton, Miss., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2019.

With millions of workers staying at home to aid public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, the security of America’s food supply and its supply chains has rarely been more important. At this moment, to the extent that there is a challenge in ensuring America’s grocery stores have enough healthy food on the shelves, it comes not from insufficient natural bounty but instead from the extraordinary burdens that COVID-19 has placed on the many low-wage workers who play such central roles in the functioning of food supply chains.

Indeed, during these trying times, farmworkers’ contributions in particular are more critical than ever. They cannot shelter at home to remain safe from COVID-19; instead, they must go to work—along with meatpacker employees, truckers, and grocery store workers—to ensure that the nation’s food supply is maintained. Farmworkers are particularly vulnerable to illness because of high rates of respiratory disease being an occupational hazard, low rates of health insurance coverage, and often substandard living and working conditions. Despite these risk factors, agricultural workers—the majority of whom are immigrants and about half of whom are undocumented—lack many of the legal protections enjoyed by most workers, which endangers their own and their families’ health and well-being.

The pandemic’s disruption of normal economic activity is clearly illustrating how crucial farmworkers are to national security and food access around the world. The European Union is already feeling the effect of tightened borders on the supply of farm labor. Farmers in the United Kingdom and Germany are reporting labor shortages, and the agricultural minister of France recently urged professionals in the industries that have been locked down to seek out work on farms. Yet farmers worry that the new workers they do recruit domestically will lack the skills necessary to efficiently harvest crops without damaging them.

Travel and immigration bans enacted in the United States and around the world have put stress on a preexisting shortage of farm labor. To supplement the domestic labor supply, many farms in the United States often rely upon the H-2A program to hire seasonal agricultural workers from other countries. In 2019, the United States issued more than 200,000 H-2A visas—accounting for about 10 percent of the agricultural workforce. Overall, including the significant share of undocumented immigrants who have for decades been the backbone of this nation’s agricultural labor force, 53 percent of farmworkers were born outside the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Last month, the U.S. Department of State announced that it would stop processing visas in Mexico, much to the alarm of growers who rely heavily on immigrant labor to meet seasonal needs. Subsequently, the State Department announced that H-2A visa processing will resume, while in-person visa interviews will be waived for anyone who interviewed the previous year. In the end, as the fear of labor and food shortages grew, the State Department decided to waive the in-person visa interview requirement for all H-2A applicants, both new and returning workers, as well as seasonal nonagricultural workers seeking entry through the H-2B program.

Furthermore, President Trump recently announced plans to sign an executive order temporarily banning people from immigrating permanently into the United States, but the anticipated announcement reportedly will not affect the entry of seasonal agricultural workers into the United States or provide any additional safeguards for the health and safety of those workers or people with whom they may come into contact.

The administration’s efforts to facilitate the entry of farmworkers into the United States even as it bans countless other immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers speaks, in part, to the important role that such farmworkers play in supporting the American economy and the country’s food security. It is reasonable for the State Department to make it easier for more farmworkers to come in order to prevent an impending food shortage. But bringing in still more workers without taking extra precautions to protect their health and safety—as well as the health and safety of all farmworkers and people with whom they interact—would be shortsighted. If nothing is done to ensure that proper protections are put in place for these farmworkers and other vulnerable food chain workers, these workers are not the only ones jeopardized; the workers that they will be living and working alongside are also at risk. Not only that, but broader efforts in the community to tamp down the disease through social distancing and sanitation efforts will also be undermined. Moreover, if farmworkers begin to contract the coronavirus, farm labor supply will decrease—with a potentially devastating effect on food production. More must be done to safeguard these important workers as they perform essential tasks.

Protecting farmworkers is essential to the nation’s food supply chain. An outbreak among farmworkers can potentially shutter entire farm operations at a time when the supply chain is already experiencing unprecedented disruption. Earlier this month, after three farmworkers tested positive for COVID-19 in Cayuga County, New York, and one of them died, farm owners became even more aware of the spread of the disease. Swift action to prevent the spread of the coronavirus must be taken. This is even more urgent in light of the shuttering of several meatpacking plants due to widespread infection among workers. Essential workers are not disposable.

Farmworkers are essential to the food supply

Many growers have long been pushing to ease requirements and expand the scope of H-2A workers in the United States to meet farm labor needs. But particularly during the novel coronavirus pandemic, it is essential that employers and the federal government also ensure the safety and security of participants—as well as that of current farmworkers and other food system workers such as meatpackers—to strengthen the security of the U.S. food supply.

The experiences of guest farmworkers pose several risks of infection. For example, migrant farmworkers journeying long distances to the United States travel on crowded buses chartered by their employers. Once in the country, they reside in employer-provided housing, which is often crowded and inadequate. These facts of daily life make it difficult, even impossible, for farmworkers to maintain social distancing and proper sanitation. If measures are not taken to ensure the health and safety of farmworkers, COVID-19 may spread rapidly among the agricultural workforce—with possibly dramatic negative implications for the national food supply.

Measures must be taken to safely meet the demand for agricultural workers. However, workers must be adequately screened before being permitted entry and must be guaranteed safe transportation, housing, and working conditions to ensure their safety and the safety of people around them. This is necessary not only to protect workers but also the supply chain itself. If one worker is forced to work while ill or is unable to access testing or care, employers risk infecting their entire workforce, which could completely shut down their operations.

Farmworkers’ basic needs must be met

Because farmworkers are essential workers on the front lines of the pandemic, lawmakers must address these workers’ safety. Unfortunately, employers do not always prioritize the safety of farmworkers, and federal law exempts farmworkers from some of the rights most other workers enjoy.

As a result of their occupation, farmworkers face increased risk of exposure and serious illness due to the coronavirus. Farmworkers commonly suffer from respiratory illnesses due to occupational hazards such as the application of pesticides—conditions that may make people more vulnerable to dangerous complications from the virus. Farmworkers who require masks and respiratory protection to safely apply pesticides or perform other tasks may soon find it difficult to procure the equipment they need due to the stress the pandemic has put on the personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain. Moreover, farmworkers often work in fields with limited access to bathrooms or basic sanitation, making it difficult to implement many of the preventive measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

If farmworkers do get sick, they likely do not have access to paid leave to take time away from work to access medical care, and they face enormous barriers to receiving the testing and care that they need to recover and keep their communities safe. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, less than half of all farmworkers, and only 24 percent of undocumented farmworkers, have health insurance. Though Congress made free COVID-19 testing available to uninsured people through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, this measure excluded many categories of immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, H-2A workers, and Temporary Protected Status holders. Moreover, rural health systems, which hospital closures have put under strain, may not be able to provide the needed care.

Despite the hazards that farmworkers face, they receive far fewer legal protections than most other workers. For example, farmworkers are not entitled to overtime pay, and farms with fewer than seven workers in a given quarter may not have to pay even the federal minimum wage. Moreover, federal law does not protect farmworkers’ right to organize unions, making it difficult for them to band together to bargain for better pay and working conditions. Some states have expanded labor rights to farmworkers. A recent New York law extends to agricultural workers overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 60 hours per week and the right to unionize. However, the state-by-state patchwork still leaves many of these essential workers unprotected.

The lack of federal legal protections for farmworkers is particularly dangerous for undocumented workers and workers with H-2A visas, whose status is dependent on petitions filed by their employer. The monopsony power gives employers leverage over workers, making it difficult for farmworkers to bargain with employers for better wages or working conditions because they cannot leave for another job without jeopardizing their immigration status.

In addition to gaps in coverage under federal labor laws, undocumented workers, who make up about half of the entire crop farmworker labor force, are reluctant to report labor law violations because of their immigration status. The fear of deportation looms large, and undocumented workers do not qualify for unemployment insurance and other social safety nets that they may need if they become sick. Though the House of Representatives passed the Farm Workforce Modernization Act in fall 2019 with a strong, bipartisan vote, the Senate has yet to take up the bill. This legislation would provide a pathway for eligible undocumented farmworkers to gain permanent residence. Yet even in the absence of legislative reform, much more can and should be done to protect workers who are currently undocumented.

Recommendations

Lawmakers must take immediate action to safeguard the farmworkers on the front lines of the pandemic. The United States cannot afford to leave farmworkers vulnerable, nor should farms be permitted to recruit migrant workers without proper safety measures in place. Farmworker employers must be required to adopt necessary measures, and operations that acquire labor through contracting companies must be held accountable as joint employers. Congress must take action to expand farmworker protections at the federal level.

Health protections

For the safety of rural communities and the security of the food supply, all farmworkers need access to free testing and treatment for COVID-19, regardless of immigration status. Rural health care access must be expanded, with particular attention to farm communities. This includes significantly increasing funding to community health centers that serve immigrant and farmworker populations in rural areas and expanding broadband access. With government support, recently closed rural hospitals could temporarily be reopened, field hospitals could be set up in areas that anticipate care shortages, and multilingual telehealth options could be made available to all—insured or not.

In addition to ensuring access to health care, lawmakers must ensure that workers’ health is protected on the job. First, farms must be required to provide their employees with timely and accurate information about COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Awareness is key to preventing the spread of the virus among farmworkers, who may live and work in close quarters. However, awareness is not enough if workers are not provided with the ability to follow the guidelines. Future legislative responses to the pandemic must enact stricter workplace safety standards, much like the stricter standards imposed in hospitals to protect health care workers. For instance, employers should make sure that their workers have sufficient handwashing stations and restrooms in workplaces and in employer-provided housing. Employers must also be required to implement modified working arrangements that allow for social distancing, such as putting fewer workers at conveyor belts at the same time.

Through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, employees are entitled to 80 hours of emergency paid sick leave and 12 weeks of emergency child care leave—with 10 of the 12 weeks paid. This includes farmworkers who are employees, or H-2A visa holders, for employers with between 50 and 500 employees. However, improvements to the federal emergency paid leave protections must cover employees of all farming operations, regardless of size.

Beyond requiring farm employers to take commonsense health measures, Congress and the Trump administration should deploy resources to provide much-needed aid to workers. The Trump administration should use the Defense Production Act to procure PPE during the pandemic, and once a sufficient supply is established, some of the equipment procured should be set aside to ensure that farmworkers and other essential workers can perform their jobs safely. The USDA’s Rural Housing Service must receive emergency funding to erect temporary housing for farmworkers who are ill or in a high-risk category and to build supplemental housing where accommodations exceed capacity and do not allow for social distancing. Finally, Congress must appropriate additional funds to migrant and seasonal Head Start programs to supply critical child care. These measures will equip these essential workers with the resources they need to stay healthy.

Hazard pay and economic security

Farmworkers are essential workers on the front lines of this pandemic, risking their health to feed the country. Federal law must require all farms to pay the minimum wage—regardless of the size of the operation—and guarantee the right of farmworkers to organize a union and bargain collectively. Currently, less than 1 percent of farmworkers are unionized, which severely hampers workers’ abilities to bargain for fair wages and better working conditions, not to mention enforce labor law. Unfortunately, rather than raising wages for these essential workers, the White House is exploring ways to lower wage standards for H-2A workers, according to NPR reporting.

Moreover, unemployment insurance must be expanded to cover all farmworkers. While farmworkers are recognized under federal law as eligible for unemployment insurance, smaller farms are not covered unless specified in state statutes.

Many farms are expecting emergency payments as a result of the third COVID-19 relief bill recently passed by Congress, which raised the borrowing limit of the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, making an additional $14 billion available for emergency payments. Congress must require that farms that receive this assistance pay their workers hazard pay equal to twice their usual wage, as well as overtime on top of that. To ensure enforcement of all worker protections, Congress should embed in every USDA office a Department of Labor detailee to serve as a farmworker advocate responsible for directing outreach to farmworkers to inform them of their rights and provide legal aid. To provide additional support, future coronavirus relief packages should also provide increased funding for community organizations that serve farmworkers, particularly those that help enforce labor rights.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently issued guidance identifying farmworkers and people involved in food processing and packaging as essential critical infrastructure workers. For this reason and others, just as DHS should issue a clear formal statement prohibiting immigration enforcement actions at or near health care facilities, it should refrain from routine immigration enforcement activities on farms and in processing plants. In general, civil immigration enforcement actions should be curtailed during the COVID-19 pandemic, unless there is a significant public safety concern that outweighs the dangers of crowded detention facilities. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus made a similar ask of the Trump administration recently, noting that preserving the nation’s food supply by protecting farmworkers is a national security imperative. Undocumented farmworkers should not live in fear of deportation, nor should they be forced to refrain from accessing vital medical care if they need it. Moreover, these critical workers should not fear retaliation from employers if they miss work due to feeling unwell. While U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement initially announced plans to modify its enforcement practices during the pandemic, tweets from the account of Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, suggest that policy was quickly reversed by higher-ups within DHS and even President Trump himself.

In addition to modifying immigration enforcement practices, the government needs to do more to protect current and new immigrant farmworkers. For workers who are already here on H-2A visas, the State Department should allow for automatic extensions and make it easier for visas to be transferred to a new employer.

Going forward, the federal government should require H-2A employers to take specific measures to protect their workers from the coronavirus. H-2A employers must demonstrate that they have taken the steps outlined in this brief to maintain a clean and safe workplace. Additionally, since many migrant workers live in employer-provided group housing, employers must guarantee that housing is properly ventilated, compliant with capacity limits, and thoroughly disinfected in compliance with CDC guidance. Employers must also guarantee transportation that is regularly sanitized and allows workers to comply with social distancing guidelines. Congress should ensure that farming operations are reimbursed for any extra costs that they incur as a result of taking preventive measures to protect their workers during the pandemic. These conditions must be certified and enforced by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency under DHS tasked with approving all visa applications; the Department of Labor; and the USDA. To ensure that permanent reforms are implemented to protect one of the most essential segments of the U.S. workforce, Congress should work toward a successful passage of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.

Conclusion

Even before the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers were the backbone of the nation’s food security, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of Americans every day. But during the current public health crisis, their work is more important than ever, as farmworkers continue to go to work—at great personal risk to themselves—to keep food in stores and on plates. Failing to protect these essential workers risks the security of the nation’s food supply. Therefore, the United States must ensure that these workers are provided with ample means to protect themselves from the virus and that they have safe and clean workplaces, economic security, and an ability to take paid leave if needed. These measures need to be in place for all farmworkers, regardless of immigration status, to make sure that they are given the opportunity to work safely to put food on American tables.

118,"Dec 31, 2020",NBC News,"As Covid surges in Mississippi Delta, food banks and hospitals are stretched thin","JACKSON, Miss. — Four days before Christmas, Chiquikta Fountain watched as a growing line of cars stretched down a mile of road in the Mississippi Delta.

From her vantage point, it seemed like every resident in the rural town of Shaw was en route to the holiday meal giveaway at Delta Hands for Hope, a nonprofit she runs to support the area’s children.

The Dec. 21 event was meant to be a cheerful affair, despite the desperate need. Hams had been purchased from a mom-and-pop grocery store. There were bags of freshly picked greens, potatoes and onions for sides. With schools on winter break, volunteers tucked cereal and cases of orange juice into bags to help tide over families with children into the new year.

There were only 140 meals to distribute in the town of roughly 1,700. The meals were meant for a group of families and senior citizens who have relied heavily on the nonprofit for weekly assistance. But word spread quickly and it soon became clear that the food on hand wouldn’t be enough.

As supplies dwindled, the group began passing out the remnants. Produce for one person, a few boxes of cereal for another.

“To have to turn these families away,” Fountain said, “I can’t even describe what it felt like to you to do that.”

Before the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger. Almost 40 percent of its residents live in poverty. In areas like Shaw, trying to make ends meet has become even more fraught as the county struggles with the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the Mississippi Delta.

Weekly case counts in December have surpassed the peak of the county’s summer surge, when so many fell ill that the county coroner asked the board of supervisors to purchase an extra refrigerator for fear he would run out of space to store the dead.

That the recent surge has so far claimed fewer lives compared to previous peaks has left little room for comfort. Cases in the county quadrupled in the weeks after Thanksgiving.

Statewide, hospitalizations for patients with the virus spiked, plummeting the number of available intensive care unit beds in the state’s rural areas and larger cities alike. By the third week of December, Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, the county’s only hospital, ran out of ICU beds, a situation that could recur as cases rise.

L. Nicole Stringfellow, who leads the Mississippi Delta office of Together for Hope, a nonprofit that assists the country’s poorest rural communities, has heard concerns about people with pneumonia showing up at hospitals only to be sent home with instructions to monitor their symptoms.

Caitlyn Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bolivar Medical Center, acknowledged that the hospital had seen an increase in patients, but said its admitting and triage practices had not changed.

The Covid-19 crisis has compounded existing health care challenges in Bolivar County: Almost 1 in 6 residents are uninsured and more likely to put off treatment as a result, and there is a shortage of medical providers.

Unlike major cities where people can access public transportation, residents without cars in rural areas like Shaw have few options for getting to medical appointments. Almost 1 in 8 households in Bolivar County lack a car, making carpooling for errands common.

Nurse practitioner Nora Gough-Davis owns Shaw Family Medical, a clinic that offers home coronavirus testing for patients without the means to come into town. Some patients feared exposing their loved ones to the virus if they asked for a ride.

Several times a week, Tracy Hall, a nurse at Shaw Family Medical, dons a surgical gown, mask, face shield and gloves and enters a home. Sometimes, she sees a patient lying on a couch, barely able to move as she swabs.

Every morning, her husband gives her the same goodbye.

""Babe, be safe.""

On the way to work, she says a prayer in her car. On occasion, patients have asked her to pray that their tests come back negative.

She understands their fears. In Bolivar County, the fallout from the virus has been particularly pernicious. Three out of every 1,000 residents in the area have died from Covid-19. Only a handful of communities in Mississippi — several of them, like Bolivar, predominantly Black and in the Delta — have lost more.

Before Mississippi’s state health officer uttered the words “hot spot,” before the local hospital ran out of ICU beds, health outcomes for Black residents in Bolivar County were already troubling.

The consequences of a shortage of health care providers in the Mississippi Delta have been evident for decades. Shorter lives. Higher rates of amputations. Stringfellow said political leaders haven’t paid enough attention to these disparities. The pandemic, she said, makes it harder to look away.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

She pointed out that four years ago, the State Health Department shut down one of the two state-run medical clinics in Bolivar. A steep drop in patients was cited as the reason, but Stringfellow said the health care needs in the region remain high.

“How do you catch those areas up?” she asked. “True access to health care.”

The current state of public education, economic opportunity, housing and health care in the region, all beleaguered in their respective ways, she argues, are “putting a Band-Aid on open-heart surgery.”

While the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has brought a note of hope for many front-line workers, physical health is only one part of the battle. The mental trauma that accompanies persistent poverty in the Delta has escalated as families struggle with the fallout of the pandemic.

“It’s like working in a funhouse mirror,” said Nadia Bethley, a psychologist with the Delta Health Center, a nonprofit that provides health care to low-income patients on a sliding fee scale. “Things weren’t great before. Now, they’re distorted and worse in a lot of ways.”

She feared for her patients leading up to the first Christmas some would experience without their loved ones. She worried about those who were already isolated becoming further detached, like many others around the world affected by this pandemic. Patients who loved attending church services and socializing before and after sermons didn’t feel the same connection online.

Others have survived the virus only to feel challenged cognitively, almost like they had a stroke. Bethley said they want to know if they’ll fully recover.

“Having to sit with people and hold space for that kind of uncertainty, shrugging my shoulders, like ‘I don’t know either,’ those are the kind of things that have hit hard the most,” she said.

Many of her patients have found their livelihoods in limbo.

“Family members who were the primary breadwinners are now dying,” Bethley said. “Do you go to work and put yourself at risk, or do you become homeless or starving?”

Job security remains fragile in the community. Half of the residents make less than $30,000 per year. And although Cleveland, the county seat of Bolivar, is a university town, which brings economic activity, good jobs are scarce enough that some residents travel across state lines for work. For two years, dozens of residents have gathered daily outside the county’s Walmart, one of the few grocery stores in the area, waiting for charter buses to ferry them to Memphis, Tennessee, two hours away, to work at a FedEx hub, where some workers make upwards of $18 per hour.

The county’s unemployment rate, which climbed to double digits in the summer, has since improved, but remains higher than this time last year.

Caressa McKay, a single mother of five in Shelby, a small town in Bolivar County, was laid off from her job at a day care center in June. She’s since found another job, but she still has to skip a phone bill or an electric bill some months to make sure her children have enough to eat.

The public assistance she receives is “not enough to constantly keep food on the table,” she said. Meals dropped off by her local school district help, but with her children home all day for remote schooling, they need more food.

“They have to eat,” she said. “I have to do what I have to do.”

Mississippi state Rep. Abe Hudson Jr., a Democrat who lives in Bolivar County, said workers have been hit hard as local businesses struggle to stay afloat.

The people who are seeking help, he said, run the gamut from middle-class professionals now stretched thin to elderly residents hesitant to enter grocery stores.

“You don’t realize the degree of need until you go out to some of these food distribution events,” Hudson said. “It’s a constant reminder of the fact that people are not getting paychecks.”

That reminder is never far from Fountain.

The nonprofit she leads, Delta Hands for Hope, previously served as a tutoring site for students and assisted with volunteer projects. Last spring, the center began operating an emergency food pantry.

But now, the food bank’s future is in question. Recently, the nonprofit went from receiving 800 boxes of fresh food twice a month to none.

The U.S. Agriculture Department’s food box program had changed its funding rules and declined to renew a contract with the farm that had been supplying Delta Hands for Hope.

Fountain’s group now uses a private grant to buy food from a corporate restaurant supplier with the goal of feeding at least 140 children and senior citizens in Shaw per week. She’s unsure if the funding will carry them past spring break.

Occasionally, she receives an alert that a church or a food bank in the region has enough to share. The group rents or borrows a truck to pick up the food.

“The biggest question is, ‘Are we going to remain an emergency food pantry?’” she asked. “What happens when those funds run out?”","Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi TodayBefore the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State’s poultry science department is now equipped with a new laboratory for conducting biosecurity level 2 research.

The department’s Animal BioSafety Level (ABSL)-2 facility, which opened last month, provides a distinctive setting for investigating and conducting research on pathogenic bacteria that affects the poultry industry.

Mary Beck, professor and head of MSU’s Department of Poultry Science, said the ABSL-2 lab enhances the department’s commitment to serve the Mississippi poultry industry through the land-grant mission of education, research and outreach.

“We are extremely excited for our department and MSU to have this facility come to fruition. This space, which was funded by the university’s Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, will help our scientists conduct research vital to this state’s most important agricultural industry,” Beck said.

Earlier this year, National Chicken Council and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association reports indicated that Mississippi’s poultry industry had an annual impact of $20 billion on the state’s economy and employed 28,500 growers and employees generating $1.5 billion in federal, state and local taxes.

Beck explained how the facility will accommodate research that benefits the industry as a whole, from the egg to the plate.

“This lab mimics a setting you’d find in the poultry industry, which allows our scientists to evaluate different aspects of disease and infection as it affects birds throughout their lifecycle from in the egg, to grow out, and ultimately harvest,” Beck said.

Researchers, including faculty and students, are trained on health and safety protocols and procedural safeguards that have been implemented to protect people and animals alike. The facility includes six individual rooms for housing battery cage and floor pen trials, a research lab to culture and study pathogens, separate screening rooms complete with sinks and sanitation stations, an autoclave, and restroom and shower facilities. Every room is fitted with a separate HEPA-filtered air handling system. Digital controls allow for the reliable control and maintenance of appropriate temperatures, lighting and humidity.

Professor Aaron Kiess, who spearheaded the effort to bring the lab to MSU, said the facility will help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat infections caused by Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and Clostridium bacteria, aiding an industry that is a vital component of food security.

Kiess said the lab provides a chance for researchers to help the poultry industry improve management strategies in disease prevention and mitigation.

“As the industry moves to a ‘no antibiotics ever’ program, now more than ever, it’s critical that we find an alternative to antibiotics, so the poultry industry can maintain safety and health of their birds for the public,” Kiess said. “If we could find antibiotic alternatives that inhibit infectious diseases caused by pathogenic organisms, this could reduce mortalities and improve bird health, leading to improvements in growth performance and ultimately more profit.”

In addition to MAFES funding, contributions to the facility were made by international animal health company Huvepharma, Inc., with all light fixtures, bulbs and dimmers provided by www.aglights.com and Overdrive Lighting.

120,"May 24, 2019",UT Knoxville News,Study: High Rates of Food Insecurity Found at Southern Appalachia Colleges,"College students in Southern Appalachia are affected by food insecurity at a higher rate than the national average, which can translate into poor academic performance and unhealthy spending habits and coping mechanisms, according to a new study coauthored by researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and published in Current Developments in Nutrition.

Researchers found that food insecurity has an average prevalence of 30.5 percent among college students who responded to online surveys at 10 four-year universities in the Southern Appalachia region, which includes Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, and West Virginia. In comparison, the national average of college students that face food insecurity is approximately 12 percent. At some campuses surveyed, food insecurity levels were as high as 51.8 percent.

Over 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the survey. Researchers performed a statistical analysis of the responses using the US Department of Agriculture’s Adult Food Security Survey and other scales to assess money expenditure, coping strategies, and academic progress.

“We found that students who are food insecure had lower academic grades than those who did not face food insecurity,” says Marsha Spence, UT professor of public health nutrition and coauthor of the study. “These same students usually try to save money on other things to obtain food, such as spending less in transportation, utilities, and sometimes even medication.”

According to the study, several factors can predict food insecurity status: being a junior or a sophomore, having an ethnic minority background, receiving financial aid, and having reported poor health indicated a higher risk of food insecurity.

“This study is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests that a large percentage of college students, including students from four-year public institutions, are at risk of food insecurity,” said coauthor Elizabeth Anderson Steeves, professor in UT’s Department of Nutrition. “Studies like ours are important to understand food insecurity and its negative effects on students, so that universities can implement policies and programs to help alleviate this problem and help students succeed.”

121,"Dec 1, 2020",Civil Eats,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped from the USDA’s Food Box Program,"Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

“’Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes—part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program—came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Lula Cooley. Lula Cooley.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers—giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce.

“When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers. They were just left out. There was a big void that was left,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director.

Despite Challenges, Program Helps Farmers, Families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers—a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss.

“Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit.

“This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale, Burkett said, because of an incredible upswelling of community support.

“Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” added the farmer. “It brought the community together.”","Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

122,"Dec 19, 2019",Center For American Progress,What It Looks Like To Be Hungry in College,"Over the past few years, the issue of food insecurity among college students has gained national attention—and with good reason. A study released earlier this year by the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice found that 48 percent of students at two-year institutions and 41 percent of students at four-year institutions experienced food insecurity during the 30 days preceding the survey.

A new study from Trellis Company provides policymakers and advocates further insight into what it looks like to be hungry while in college. The study defined low food security as a situation in which a student missed meals altogether or couldn’t afford a balanced meal. Over a nine-month period in 2017, Trellis Company followed 72 college students and found that 36 of them experienced food insecurity at some point. The study explored the lived experiences of these students; how they coped with the challenges of food insecurity; and how these circumstances influenced their academic performance.

The study’s findings should help inform policymakers and institutional leaders on how to support college students facing food insecurity. In particular, three significant insights emerged: Students are often reluctant to receive or seek help; food insecurity often fluctuates; and food insecurity can have a pervasive effect on students’ higher education experiences.

A reluctance to accept help

The study emphasizes that interventions designed to support hungry college students need to take into account that those students may be reluctant to seek out or accept help from their institution or other public or nonprofit resources. Many interviewed students didn’t consider their schools as sources of help for nonacademic needs such as food assistance, while some believed that these institutions should instead save resources for students who are in more desperate need. Other students described feeling that they were expected to project competence and responsibility and that taking food from a food pantry could hurt others’ perceptions of them.

Many students in the study also expressed reluctance to pursue public benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), often because they thought either that the application process is too much of a hassle or that they would not qualify. This concern isn’t unfounded: Just 18 percent of college students qualify for SNAP—and only 3 percent actually receive it. This has prompted lawmakers to propose legislation that would expand the program to address food insecurity among low-income college students. Only two students in the study who experienced low food security reported applying for SNAP benefits. One full-time student who is also a single parent had to weigh the possibility of being approved for benefits against the loss of a couple hours of wages to fill out the application.

Fluctuations in food insecurity

While one might assume that a student is either struggling to meet their basic needs or not, the Trellis Company study shows that food security—or lack thereof—is often a fluid condition. Over the course of the study, 26 participants endured a decline in their food security, while 30 participants experienced an improvement.

The most common reason underlying a decline in students’ food security was an unexpected expense such as a car repair, a speeding ticket, or health issues affecting themselves or a family member. Students who relied on family financial support were likewise affected by unexpected events in relatives’ lives such as a layoff, business hardship, health problems, or additional expenses.

College students also reported frequently having to cut their hours at their jobs to focus on studying. Some chose to quit their jobs while others were let go. Regardless of the reason, these challenges affected their finances and therefore their food security: A decline in a student’s financial security typically caused them to start eating irregularly or consuming lower-quality meals in an effort to reduce costs.

Additionally, students might experience improvements in food security because they received more financial help from friends or family; adhered to a strict budget; cooked at home; or, in rare cases, received help from SNAP benefits or additional financial aid. Certain changes in housing situations—usually students moving in with family or a partner—also alleviated pressure.

These circumstances demonstrate that just one small change in a student’s life can determine whether or not they are food secure. College officials should take these changing circumstances into account and ensure students are aware of their colleges’ financial resources such as emergency funds as well as receive clear information on accessing SNAP benefits.

A pervasive effect on students’ higher education experience

Food insecurity negatively affected the lives of students in the study both academically and socially.

Some food-insecure students reported having very little free time because they tried to earn as much money as they could by working long hours in addition to attending classes and studying. Tight finances also constrained social activities due to the costs involved, which the study said can “have direct academic implications” because social activities can provide a reprieve from stress and a sense of community. To avoid this problem, some students reported spending beyond their means to foster relationships, putting them at greater risk of food insecurity.

Students enduring financial and academic stress often reported losing sleep, eating poorly, and becoming ill—all of which are likely to affect their academic performance. Poor academic performance can have its own financial repercussions, as earning lower grades might result in losing a scholarship. One full-time student described what it was like to struggle with housing, food, and school at the same time:

I wouldn’t be able to focus or I would lose sleep, I would just be really anxious. And so I would be lying in bed trying to sleep and I couldn’t because I was stressing out about money or where I was gonna get it, and I wouldn’t be doing homework because I needed to sleep. And so, I would just be angry because I was wasting time being awake.

The study noted that “[w]hen students were able to become food secure, they often reported increased sleep, reduced stress, and higher levels of energy.” In other words, food security is directly related to students’ ability to thrive in college.

Conclusion

The authors of the Trellis Company study recommended that colleges be more attuned to students’ basic needs by, for example, improving financial aid and emergency aid; making academic schedules more accommodating for those who work; providing child care services; and training faculty and staff to watch for signs of poverty. They also recommended opening food pantries in prominent locations and making them available to all students in an effort to help destigmatize poverty. Finally, they suggested providing students with coaching and workshops to help them learn financial and food preparation skills, although some studies show that this approach has not proved effective in changing behaviors.

Certain policy reforms at the federal level—such as updating SNAP eligibility rules and clarifying eligibility requirements to accommodate more college students—would help alleviate food insecurity in college. More broadly, however, the prevalence of food insecurity among college students is a symptom of the increasing unaffordability of higher education in America. As CAP proposed in “Beyond Tuition,” policymakers must grapple with students’ living costs—including food and housing—in any effort to make college affordable. A system that allows college students to struggle with food insecurity as they try to focus on their studies shortchanges them of their opportunity to build a better life.

Dante Barboy is a former intern for Postsecondary Education at the Center for American Progress.

Author’s note: This column uses “food insecurity” and “low food security” interchangeably throughout.","Over the past few years, the issue of food insecurity among college students has gained national attention—and with good reason.
A new study from Trellis Company provides policymakers and advocates further insight into what it looks like to be hungry while in college.
The study’s findings should help inform policymakers and institutional leaders on how to support college students facing food insecurity.
This concern isn’t unfounded: Just 18 percent of college students qualify for SNAP—and only 3 percent actually receive it.
This has prompted lawmakers to propose legislation that would expand the program to address food insecurity among low-income college students."
123,"Jun 29, 2018",Brookings Institution,Children’s exposure to food insecurity is still worse than it was before the Great Recession,"By many measures, the economy has recovered from the Great Recession. The unemployment rate is lower than it’s been in decades. In July 2017 the jobs gap, the number of jobs needed to return to the national employment rate prior to the Great Recession, accounting for population growth and aging, closed. In 2016, the poverty rate fell to 12.7 percent—nearly the same as its pre-recession levels.

But, another important indicator of economic health, food insecurity, remains elevated over pre-recession rates despite the best labor market in more than a decade.

A household is food insecure if it does not have consistent access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources. The share of households experiencing food insecurity is continuing to recover from its recession-era peak of 14.9 percent, and in 2016 fell to 12.3 percent. That is still above its pre-recession level of 11.1 percent.

The debate about SNAP during Farm Bill reauthorization has focused on adults; but, 43 percent of SNAP beneficiaries are households with children. Children are exposed to higher rates of food insecurity than the population overall. During the summer, school-age children lose access to school-provided breakfast and lunch and SNAP benefits do not adjust to account for this.

At the national level, the share of food insecure households with children is 16.5 percent—still above the 2007 pre-recession level of 15.8 percent but well below the Great Recession peak of 21.3 in 2009. 12.9 million children lived in food insecure households in 2016.

Furthermore, 4.8 percent of households with children had very low food security in 2016, meaning that food intake was reduced and normal eating patterns were disrupted because the household lacked money and other resources for food.

National trends conceal even higher levels of food insecurity for many states. In this piece, we provide an update of rates of child exposure to food insecurity and very low food security in the states. In only two states – Colorado and South Carolina – were the share of children living in households with food insecurity and very low food security lower in 2014-16 than in 2005-07. In 23 states the share of children living in food insecure households was statistically significantly higher than just prior to the Great Recession.

The state-level picture

Every state has more than 10 percent of children living in food insecure households.[1] Nonetheless, states vary widely in the degree to which its children are exposed to food insecurity. In 16 states, more than one-in-five children live in food insecure households. In four states – Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico – more than one-in-four children live in food insecure households.

While the share of children living in households with food insecurity has continued to fall in the national numbers, only four states are doing statistically significantly better than pre-recession levels (2005-07 to 2014-16). Far out in front is Iowa, which has seen a more than 25 percent reduction in the share of children living in food-insecure households from 2005-07 to 2014-16. In 23 states, the shares of children living in food-insecure households is statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that these states are back to pre-recession levels.

Almost half of states had a rate of children living in food-insecure households in 2014-16 that was statistically significantly higher than in 2005-07. Connecticut, Delaware, and New Mexico’s share of children living in food-insecure households increased by almost 50 percent; in Alabama the rate almost doubled.

In almost half of states more than 6 percent of children lived in households with very low food security. Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico had the highest rates of food insecurity and were also at or near the top of the distribution of the share of children living in households with very low food security. In addition, in Rhode Island, Maine, Nebraska, Connecticut, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Nevada more than 7 percent of children lived in households with very low food security.

Child exposure to very low food security was statistically significantly higher in 21 states in 2014-16 compared with 2005-07. In 2014-16, the share of children living in households with very low food security remained double (Rhode Island, North Dakota), triple (Nebraska, New Mexico), and quadruple (Alabama, New Hampshire) pre-recession levels. Only four states had a statistically significant reductions in the share of children living in households with very low food security in 2014-16 compared with 2005-07: South Carolina, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi. For the remaining 25 states and the District of Columbia, the percent of children living in households with very low food security in 2014-16 are indistinguishable from 2005-07.

These rates of food insecurity and very low food security are snapshots taken during the school year. As we have written, during the summer, children from food insecure households have less consistent access to food. A recent US Department of Agriculture demonstration project found that providing families with an extra $60 per month during the summer reduced household rates of food insecurity by 15 percent and very low food security by one-third. To reduce exposure to food insecurity and very low food security among children, Congress should consider increasing SNAP benefit levels, especially to households with children.","A household is food insecure if it does not have consistent access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources.

125,"Sep 1, 2020",talkbusiness.net,Data confirms Delta region one of the hardest hit by COVID-19,"Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. One region, often cited as the most impoverished in the country according to economic metrics, the Mississippi Delta Region, has been hit particularly hard, according to data collected by the Delta Grassroots Caucus.

“The Delta continues to suffer seriously from the pandemic and a strong recovery is still not here. A collection of data from across the region indicate the need for a strong economic stimulus from federal, state and private sector sources. An overly rosy depiction of the Delta’s economy is counterproductive because we need to admit we still have a severe problem in order to solve it,” said Lee Powell, Caucus director.

Four of the top counties in Arkansas in terms of high unemployment include Chicot (13.6%), Mississippi (12.6%), Phlllips (11.8%) and Crittenden (11.6%). Craighead County (7.7%) remained the lone bright spot in terms of economic metrics in the region.

Other key findings from the compilation include:

Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana had the four highest rates of food insecurity based on a Feeding America survey. The Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research found the highest food insecurity levels were in Mississippi (31.6%) and Louisiana (30.1%), with Arkansas the fifth highest at 25.9%.

A survey of the University of Arkansas Department of Sociology and Criminology found that Arkansas and other Southern and mid-Southern states had elevated levels of food insecurity due to COVID-19. In the category of “reduced quality, desirability or variety of diet,” the four worst rates were all from “Greater Delta Region” states: Alabama (47.7%), Arkansas (47.4%), Tennessee (45.1%) and Kentucky (44%).

A University of Louisiana at Lafayette report found that job losses in Louisiana were virtually twice as high in the pandemic as compared with after Hurricane Katrina – by 11% in the first half of this year, as compared with a 6% drop after Katrina in 2005. Louisiana’s gross domestic product contraction of 6% was one of the five sharpest drops among all states.

An Illinois Municipal League survey found that 87% of municipalities expected a substantial revenue shortfall due to the pandemic. Many communities advised that they will need greater assistance from federal and state governments. The Southern Illinois Delta area chronically fares worse than the statewide economic figures for Illinois.

ALREADY VULNERABLE

The Delta economy was vulnerable due to many small businesses that were struggling even before the pandemic. Many have closed or have not come back yet, and many low-income people who did not have large savings to see them through a downturn are struggling financially, the data reflects.

The region’s diverse population with many African Americans and some other minorities has been hit harder by both higher virus infection rates and more economic losses, with minority women being especially hard hit because women suffered the largest job losses and as minorities they have higher virus infection rates; and the region’s economy had major manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors that have been hit disproportionately by the recession.

Harvey Joe Sanner, president of American Ag Movement of Arkansas in Des Arc, said “the situation is bleak.”

“Our job situation is worsening. as one of our large employers in Lonoke, Remmington Arms is laying off workers… I think most people feel that our situation, both health-wise and economically, will get worse before it gets better,” Sanner said.

Millie Atkins, Delta Caucus senior adviser and veteran Delta regional advocate based in Monroe, La., said the organization will seek federal relief.

“This pandemic has shed a great light on the many economic, social and educational inequities in a number of areas where the Delta was vulnerable such as the large number of job losses, the many low-income jobs that made it difficult for people to accumulate savings that could see them through a downturn, the small business closures that have not come back yet,” she said.

Powell said the Delta Grassroots Caucus will advocate for a continuing strong stimulus package at the annual Delta conference on Oct. 13-14, 2020, which will largely be conducted by Zoom webinar due to the coronavirus. Delta Caucus partners across the region are calling for a strong economic stimulus and safety net package to jump-start the region’s economy. Suggestions for a policy package include continuing larger unemployment benefits and strong federal and state economic stimulus packages to deal with unprecedented job losses.

The Caucus will seek a 15% increase in SNAP and other nutrition benefit programs during the pandemic – although SNAP is primarily an anti-hunger program, it also has an economic stimulus impact, with every $1 spent on SNAP generating $1.70 in economic benefits. The Caucus will ask for a major infrastructure expansion program to create jobs, repair deteriorating infrastructure, and stimulate the economy.

The Caucus will seek funding for Job creation and retention programs through tax incentives for investing in economically distressed areas. It will ask for maintaining education and workforce development programs during the pandemic, which will require a major broadband access expansion initiative through programs such as USDA’s Rural Re-Connect high-speed broadband program and state programs like Arkansas’ Rural Connect (ARC).","Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

OXFORD, Miss. – Entering its 10th year of operations, the North Mississippi VISTA Project has made significant strides toward poverty alleviation, capacity building, sustainable solutions and community empowerment in north Mississippi.

The project’s 148 yearlong VISTA members and 145 VISTA summer associates represent a $7.1 million investment of human capital in the region.

Since 2010, NMVP has placed full-time VISTA members to serve yearlong and summer terms at partner organizations based on the University of Mississippi campus and in communities across a 28-county area. Housed at the McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement, NMVP is a key community partnership initiative in the institute’s work to fight poverty and transform lives through education, innovation and entrepreneurship.

With the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities already struggling with disparities in health, income and educational access, the work of NMVP has taken on a greater urgency.

“It is an honor to lead the North Mississippi VISTA Project at a time when communities are mobilizing COVID response and recovery efforts,” said Emily Echols, project manager with the McLean Institute. “VISTA members build capacity for programs that support academic gains, financial stability, housing security and food security.

“There is a heightened urgency around this work right now, and NMVP allows the University of Mississippi to fulfill its public purpose during the pandemic.”

VISTA members commit to one year of national service, focusing on building sustainable capacity within community-based organizations and delivering a measurable impact on the populations they serve. VISTAs work to manage and recruit volunteers; create programs that foster growth in literacy and math; develop content to promote financial literacy; foster social entrepreneurship; raise funds through grant writing, special events and campaigns; and raise the profile of their host sites through social media outreach.

“Serving as a VISTA member with the Minority PUL Alliance and as a VISTA leader has been a tremendous opportunity for me to grow as a nonprofit and community engagement professional,” said VISTA leader Adriana Cooper, of Blue Mountain. “The NMVP network is improving lives across north Mississippi, and it’s exciting to be a part of that work as our project builds momentum.”

The 2020-21 grant represents an investment of nearly $600,000 in the region. During the 2020-21 program year, 20 yearlong VISTA members will build the capacity of poverty alleviation efforts at the following locations:

Boys and Girls Club of Lexington (Holmes County)

But God Ministries (Coahoma County)

Doors of Hope (Lafayette County)

Griot Arts (Coahoma County)

Higher Purpose Co. (Coahoma County)

LOU Reads (Lafayette County)

Minority PUL Alliance (Lee County)

Operation Fit Nation (Lafayette County)

Oxford Community Market (Lafayette County)

Pontotoc County School District (Pontotoc County)

Rust College Community Development Corporation (Marshall County)

Tallahatchie Arts Council (Union County)

Union County Heritage Museum (Union County)

Yoknapatawpha Arts Council (Lafayette County)

Center for Math and Science Education (UM campus)

Luckyday Residential College (UM campus)

School of Education (UM campus)

Recruitment efforts are underway to fill five remaining yearlong positions.

“The contributions of VISTA members can be transformative for organizations,” said Laura Martin, associate director of the McLean Institute. “In the past year alone, members of NMVP raised over $291,000 for their organizations, supervised over 700 volunteers and reached over 900 beneficiaries through educational programs, mentorship, financial literacy, housing support and referrals to alleviate long-term hunger.

“These impacts, in turn, transform individual lives and communities.”

Many members of NMVP have gone on to pursue additional education to promote the public good and to launch careers in higher education and the nonprofit sector.

Denae Bradley graduated from UM in 2016 with a degree in psychology and a minor in African American studies. As a program development VISTA with the UM Office of Sustainability from 2016 to 2017, Bradley deepened community-campus partnerships around food security and access to local produce.

She completed a master’s degree in sociology at UM in 2019 and is a doctoral student in sociology at Howard University, where her research centers on reproductive health care for incarcerated women.

“The VISTA project is central to the McLean Institute’s efforts to transform lives and build social capital to improve quality of life,” said Albert Nylander, professor of sociology and director of the McLean Institute.

“We remain grateful for the opportunity to lead NMVP and for the continued investment of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Office of the Provost, the College of Liberal Arts and the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in these partnerships.”","– Entering its 10th year of operations, the North Mississippi VISTA Project has made significant strides toward poverty alleviation, capacity building, sustainable solutions and community empowerment in north Mississippi.

127,"Aug 5, 2020",USA TODAY,COVID-19 has left millions of Americans without enough food. Here's how Senate can help.,"CLOSE The US recently topped 4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and now has reached another unenviable milestone. USA TODAY

Today’s environment is unlike anything our nation has ever experienced. We are on the brink of an economic and food security disaster

As a nation, we have a moral and economic obligation to address child hunger, food insecurity and avoid economic collapse in the wake of COVID-19. While we have different political viewpoints, we strongly agree that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is one of the most effective tools we have to fight the looming health and economic crises facing our great country.

The Senate is at a critical decision point as to how we use this tool. That’s why together, we are calling for a temporary 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits, bound to economic indicators, in the next federal coronavirus relief package.

Even in the best of economic times, far too many Americans struggle to put food on the table. This is especially concerning for families, where children need nutritious food to grow up healthy and strong.

Today’s environment is unlike anything our nation has ever experienced. We are on the brink of an economic and food security disaster that will impact every citizen, but disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals including children, the elderly, rural Americans, Black, indigenous and people of color.

Communities of color are particularly hard hit by coronavirus, forcing local food banks to feed more with less as need increases all over the country. (Photo: USAT)

For years, the number of hungry children was declining. But, a new Save the Children report shows that many children now face even greater risk. New estimates from Northwestern University based on Census Bureau data indicate the percentage of families who are considered food insecure has increased during the pandemic, is much higher than during the Great Recession, and, of great concern, disproportionately affect children and families of color.

Rural communities hit hard

The situation is particularly stark in rural communities. Even before the pandemic, Feeding America data showed that nearly 90 percent of the counties with the highest percentage of children at risk of going hungry were rural. Kentucky, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Nevada and North Carolina will be hit hardest by growing food insecurity in the wake of the pandemic, according to new projections.

Children such as Emma and Devan from rural Kentucky relied on meals served at school. Their great-great-grandmother Claudette, who is raising the kids, didn’t realize how much milk and bread her children go through in a week. She doesn’t have reliable transportation to get to the grocery store about 30 miles away, and because of her age, she falls into a higher-risk category should she contract COVID-19.

Since the closures, their family has benefited from food distributions and meal deliveries by school bus. Stress, in addition to hunger, is certainly rising in rural pockets across America, with schools going into the red to fill the feeding gap.

During normal times, America could turn to stopgaps like food banks and other feeding initiatives to supplement federal nutrition programs. Despite additional support in the CARES Act, the unprecedented need stemming from this pandemic has already strained existing resources and programs, with no end in sight.

Charities can't keep up with needs

Save the Children has helped serve rural children more than 1.8 million meals from the end of March through May. Yet, reports of staggering, miles-long lines at food pantries show that we simply cannot expect hunger relief organizations or schools to meet the need alone.

We do not know how long the economic damage of the pandemic will last. SNAP can and should be part of the solution — putting resources directly and immediately into the wallets of Americans. A temporary 15 percent increase in the SNAP maximum allotment level would equate to an additional $25 per person per month.

Every dollar in SNAP benefits generates about $1.54 in economic activity. Increased spending on food enabled by SNAP supports essential businesses small and large, stimulates local economies and helps to support American farmers.

Of note, SNAP infrastructure already exists and stands ready to immediately distribute benefits directly to those who are eligible. Working within an existing program avoids the high costs and long delays associated with standing up a new program.

SNAP’s strict eligibility requirements prevent benefits from going to those who are not truly in need and ensure that no one who needs and wants the help is inadvertently left out.

Preventing children from going hungry, implementing smart, efficient policy solutions and supporting economic security for millions of Americans are common ground issues, no matter your political party. We come from different backgrounds, have different political beliefs and have different views on a host of policy issues, but on this, we are aligned and in lock step, because we know it’ll help kids like Emma and Devan.

Temporarily boosting SNAP by 15 percent is one tool that’s readily available to immediately keep American children from going hungry and shield them from the worst economic impacts of COVID-19. We urge Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Chuck Schumer and their fellow senators to use it.

Dr. Bill Frist is a heart transplant surgeon, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader and a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He co-chaired the policy center's SNAP Task Force, which published “Leading with Nutrition: Leveraging Federal Programs for Better Health.”

Mark K. Shriver is senior vice president of U.S. Programs and Advocacy at Save the Children. In June, Save the Children released ""The Land of Inopportunity: Closing the Childhood Equity Gap for America’s Kids,"" which features county-level rankings for child well-being, including food insecurity.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A Mississippi State graduate student is being recognized this year as a Future Leader in Science, an honor bestowed by the agronomy tri-societies—the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America and Soil Science Society of America.

Charles “Hunt” Walne, an MSU agronomy doctoral student in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, earlier this year was one of 18 graduate students chosen as a recipient of the Future Leader in Science award and invited to the tri-societies’ annual Congressional Visits Day at the U.S. Capitol to advocate the importance of federal funding for agricultural research to Mississippi legislators.

In keeping with the United Nations General Assembly having named 2020 the “International Year of Plant Health,” the Collierville, Tennessee native also was invited to the Capitol event to present research conducted by K. Raja Reddy—Walne’s major professor—about crop performance in projected future climates. This work was made possible using the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station’s unique Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research Facility, known as the SPAR unit.

Reddy, a research professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences and MAFES scientist, discussed why Walne’s recognition is a testament to his exemplary dedication to the field of agricultural research as a whole.

“I had the opportunity to mentor Hunt starting from junior year of his undergraduate studies and now serve as his major professor as he pursues his doctoral degree. Hunt understands the big picture of the issues related to food security at the national and global levels and how his interest in research and leadership can help shape policy decisions now and in the future,” Reddy said.

Walne served as team leader during the national event, leading discussion with policymakers about the importance of funding for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative as well as funding for the Agriculture Advanced Research Development Authority, two competitive grants that focus on advancing agricultural research and education.

“Everyone we spoke with was receptive. Congressional members understand the importance of this,” he said.

Walne said while agricultural research garners support on both sides of the aisle, the Congressional Visits Day is an opportunity for leaders to focus on the need for a safe, plentiful food supply.

“These events serve as a bridge between policymakers and agricultural experts,” Walne said. “It’s important that there’s a space for researchers and scientists to share what they know and explain why it’s vital to continue the progress made in producing food and fiber to feed and clothe a growing population.”

“We wouldn’t be able to conduct the research we do at universities if it weren’t for the support we receive from our federal government. I’m proud to have had the chance to represent Mississippi State and advocate for research funding, not only for our university but for the agricultural research sector in general,” Walne said.

129,3 weeks ago,Scott County Times,SALTER:China trade standoff resolution is critical for Mississippi farmers seeking vital markets,"Below is an opinion column by Sid Salter:

For Mississippi farmers, the transition between the administrations of former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden could not be more impactful on any topic more so than in agricultural trade with China.

China is the third leading trading partner for Mississippi exports behind Canada and Mexico, with $759 million in value in 2020 – with that number representing a 63.8 percent increase over the previous year. That grow came after 2018-2019 tariffs standoff between China and the Trump administration led to hundreds of millions in lost export revenues to Mississippi producers.

A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018. The same study found that in 2018, trade with China supported 64,000 Mississippi jobs – which highlighted the need for China to abide by the commitments under the “phase one” trade agreements.

Writing in Foreign Policy on Oct. 27, 2020, Clark Packard framed the U.S. China trade standoff succinctly: “Trump’s aggressive trade war with China took things from bad to worse for U.S. farmers. Over the course of about 18 months, Washington and Beijing engaged in a back-and-forth volley of escalating trade restrictions, including Chinese retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,000 categories of U.S. agricultural products such as pork, soybeans, dairy products, and nuts.

“In January 2020, the two sides signed a detente, but it’s only a temporary reprieve to a conflict that continues to fester and is likely to resurface in the near future. As part of the so-called phase one agreement, Beijing agreed to purchase about $32 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products over two years,” he observed.

Why should this matter to Mississippians? China’s path to superpower status is blocked most readily by their struggle to produce enough food to feed its own 1.4 billion population and also influence and alleviate regional concerns over hunger and food insecurity.

China has been able in recent years to produce rice and wheat sufficient to meet the nation’s needs, but still must import soybeans and corn as feedstuffs sufficient to satisfy the population’s growing taste for meat.

Not only is China’s massive population problematic in producing hunger and food insecurity issues, but pollution, water aquifer depletion, and the impacts of climate change are also threatening future internal abilities to feed that nation and her allies. The loyalty of regional neighbor nations dependent on food aid also remains in the balance moving forward.

In reaction to the U.S.-China trade standoff, Mississippi (along with Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska) in 2019 cut a trade deal with Taiwan for them to import about $2 billion in soybeans and corn in 2020 and 2021.

But prior to the trade war, about 80 percent of the state’s soybean production was being sold to China. Under Biden’s new Secretary of Agriculture, initial reports are that China is living up to most of its pledges on the “phase one” trade deal. That deal called for China to buy $12.5 billion in American agriculture products in 2020 and another $19.5 billion in 2021.

Vilsack blames the COVID-19 pandemic as an obstacle to China’s meeting the deal but says he’s optimistic and with apparent evidence on his side. Politico reports that U.S. farm exports are projected to hit a record $31.5 billion during Biden’s first year in office – some $4.5 billion than projected in November 2020.

Mississippi farmers producing soybeans and corn hope those projections are accurate and that Biden’s national security and trade advisors can restore American access to vital Chinese markets.

Despite global concerns over the future of shipping, trade and maritime security issues in the South China Sea, it remains advantageous for China to keep imports of food and feed grains coming to supplement what they can’t successfully produce on their own.

Before the Trump trade wars, two of every three Mississippi soybeans were sold to China. Mississippi farmers would like to see that trade relationship restored.","A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018.

(DTN\Progressive Farmer photo by Becky Mills)

Every five years, a long and, one would have to believe, expensive process, ensues where a lengthy list of people with PhDs and MDs behind their names work on a report that will be the foundation for Dietary Guidelines for the next five years.

This year's report is 835 pages. Using all of this data, a new, formal set of Dietary Guidelines is expected to be released next month. For the first time ever, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee expanded recommendations to include children ages 12 to 24 months, and also considered the impact of food insecurity on Americans' health.

Reviewing the Committee's executive summary, the bad news comes early. This is the news we as Americans pretty much ignore. To put it in a nutshell, we are fat (70% overweight or obese) and we are sick (6 in 10 have one chronic condition; 4 in 10 have two or more chronic conditions). Add to this, food insecurity and a lack of access to affordable and heathy food.

Using 2018 data, the Committee reports more than 37 million people (6 million of them children) live in households that were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food to meet their needs. In 2020, is that number higher given the COVID-19 crisis and unemployment figures?

The Committee notes it began work in March 2019, and when it submitted its report the country was in the midst of the pandemic. The group noted this and said that as more is learned about the infection ""it is clear that it has significant nutritional implications."" Those most at risk for serious outcomes, noted the report, are those afflicted by diet-related chronic diseases.

""Finally, throughout the world, the consequences of physical isolation and financial disruption by the threat of COVID-19 infection has led to significant increases in food insecurity and hunger, furthering increasing susceptibility to both infectious and diet-related chronic disease,"" noted the Committee's Chair, Barbara Schneeman; and vice chair, Ronald Kleinman.

Some key takeaways from the report with regards to what we should eat and how this might affect chronic illnesses, including cancer and cardiovascular disease, follow. These are not yet formal recommendations, but they will likely be the foundation of coming guidelines.

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION

Pregnant women should consume at least 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week, making choices that are lower in methylmercury and higher in Omega-3 fatty acids. Folic acid supplementation was associated with a better ""maternal folate status"" during pregnancy and reduced risk of hypertensive disorders among women at high risk or with a previous history of these disorders. Some limited evidence suggested supplementation with Omega-3 fatty acids could lead to ""favorable cognitive development in children"".

BIRTH TO AGE 24 MONTHS

Nutritional exposures in the first 1,000 days of life contribute to long-term health, but also help shape taste preferences and food choices. Evidence suggested human milk feeding may be related to infant fatty acid status, depending on maternal diet. The Committee supported recommendations for lactating women to consume food sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as fish.","For the first time the Dietary Guidelines Committee expanded its recommendations to children 12-to-24-months, calling for consumption of nutrient-rich foods, including animal-source foods.

133,1 month ago,Today.com,SNAP expansion and worker safety: How Biden's executive orders affect the food world,"President Joe Biden has signed multiple executive orders since being sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Jan. 20, just over a week ago.

Many of have focused on aid to help the country cope with the coronavirus pandemic, while more recent orders have focused on racial equity and climate change.

Several of the orders will have impacts on the food world, the workers in food industries and on food insecurity, which is at record-high levels amid the pandemic.

Expansion of food assistance programs

On Jan. 22, Biden signed an executive order that aims to expand food assistance programs and increase the amount of aid people are eligible for.

In early January, under former president Donald J. Trump, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit allotments were increased by 15% for the first six months of 2021. Biden's executive order seeks to extend that period through September.

The order also aims to allow states to increase SNAP emergency benefits for those most in need: The Trump administration allowed all families not currently receiving the maximum monthly benefit to receive that amount, but very low-income households that were already receiving the maximum monthly benefit did not see any increase. The Biden executive order called for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to seek out options to give these families an increase, something Feeding America Managing Director of Policy Robert Campbell said was encouraging.

""About 37% of SNAP households who were already at that maximum benefit level saw no increase in their food assistance because of the (Trump administration's) interpretation,"" Campbell told TODAY Food. ""By design, those 37% are the households with the lowest incomes … They don't have any of their own resources to contribute towards food for their families. … We want to make sure that those with the lowest incomes who are struggling the most are not left out.""

The executive order also asks the USDA to re-examine the underlying SNAP benefit formula, which Campbell said doesn't correctly indicate the current cost of a nutritious diet.

""What this does is ask USDA to go back and look at what they call their Thrifty Food Plan, which is the basis that underlies base net benefits,"" he said. ""It's more than 30 years old, it makes a whole lot of assumptions that we think are far outdated for how individuals prepare their food, the types of food they purchase. … A lot of evidence and research shows it needs to be updated. By doing so, we hope it'll better reflect the benefits that households need.""

Another part of the order focuses on the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT), which helps low-income families with school-age children by providing them with food dollars equivalent to the value of meals missed due to COVID-19–related closures of schools, daycares and other facilities. Campbell said the program's current cap is low, $5.86 per child per school day, but the executive order will raise that cap by approximately 15%.

Protections for worker health and safety

Other executive orders from the Biden administration seek to ensure that workers stay safe amid the pandemic, which could have an impact on those working in places like restaurants, grocery stores and meatpacking plants.

While the executive order, issued on Jan. 21, does not place any immediate obligations on private companies, it directs the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue new guidance for workplaces within the next two weeks, in consultation with other appropriate federal agencies, and increase enforcement of that guidance.

OSHA is also being asked to consider whether ""emergency temporary workplace safety standards on COVID-19 are necessary."" If those standards are found to be necessary, they must be issued by March 15. The agency is also being told to focus enforcement efforts on ""violations that put the largest number of workers at risk of COVID-19"" and ensure equity in enforcement.

The agency has also been instructed to ""conduct a multilingual effort"" informing workers of their rights in the workplace.

Unemployment insurance for those leaving unsafe workplaces

In an executive order signed on Jan. 22, Biden asked that the Department of Labor consider clarifying rules regarding the ""federally guaranteed right"" of workers to ""refuse employment that will jeopardize their health"" while still being eligible to receiving unemployment insurance.

According to CNBC, most workers can't refuse ""suitable work"" and still collect unemployment insurance. Suitable work is considered a job that matches your skill set and pays a similar rate to previous employment. During the pandemic, that definition changed, and states and local governments were allowed to make their own determinations of what constituted a ""safe work environment."" Biden's executive order, paired with the order protecting worker health and safety, hopes to provide one federal standard.

Workers will still have to prove that their work environment places their health at risk and that they have asked their employer to enforce an ""improved standard,"" CNBC reported. Workers will also have to show that employers chose not to act on recommended health and safety guidance from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A ""general fear of contracting the virus"" is not considered cause to refuse suitable work.

Dr. Siby Sekou, the president and CEO of ROC United, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of restaurant employees, said that the executive order will make it safer for food workers to do their jobs.

""These guidelines establish a clear link between health, safety and economic justice,"" he told TODAY, adding that he hopes the new orders will keep workers from being retaliated against if they report unsafe behavior by their employers. ""It is really important for workers to be able to take care of their families financially when they feel like they are at risk of getting sick or getting their families sick.""

Order affecting speed in chicken processing plants

Another action by Biden, this one signed on Jan. 25, withdrew a Trump administration request that would have raised the maximum speed at which chicken processing plants can operate.

Currently, slaughterhouses process 140 birds per minute, and in 2018, the Trump administration gave waivers to 54 poultry plants allowing them to increase that number to 175 birds per minute. The Trump administration request would have extended that increase to all poultry plants.

A Washington Post investigation found that plants that had waivers allowing them to process 175 birds per minute were 10 times likelier to have coronavirus cases.

Biden's executive order does not revoke existing waivers but will prevent plants without waivers from increasing their production speed to more than 140 birds per minute.

100-day pause on deportations

One of Biden's first executive orders was a 100-day pause on deportations of undocumented immigrants; it's estimated that at least 50% of the workforce in the farm work and meat processing industries is undocumented.

Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. Programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said that this likely won't have a major impact, since arrests and deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had dropped during the pandemic, and there hasn't been a large-scale raid on a workplace since August 2019.

""A lot of these meatpacking plants and food processing plants are in fairly rural areas where ICE doesn't have a huge presence,"" Capps told TODAY. ""Excepting those really unusual large operations, there haven't been large ICE arrests in those areas.""

Biden has also changed ICE priorities, focusing on undocumented immigrants who have committed an aggravated felony, making the scope for any potential deportations much narrower.

"" … We're starting from a point where there's already low activity, and then what they're (doing) is resetting, basically, back to where things were at the end of the Obama administration,"" said Capps. ""That's basically saying that the vast majority of the unauthorized immigrant population is off-limits.""","President Joe Biden has signed multiple executive orders since being sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Jan. 20, just over a week ago.

134,"Dec 26, 2019",Ole Miss News,Graduate Student Highlights Nutrition Education for Athletes at 3MT,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – Rebecca Henry, a student in the University of Mississippi‘s Coordinated Program in Dietetics, recently came in second in the master’s category during the Three-Minute Thesis competition hosted by the UM Graduate School.

Her research examined a food education and food security intervention with the Calhoun City High School football team to determine whether food education increased the players’ nutrition knowledge.

Henry conducted the research, funded by the UM Foundation’s Food and Nutrition Security Support fund, through the Office of Food and Nutrition Security under the direction of David H. Holben, professor of nutrition, Gillespie Distinguished Scholar and OFNS director.

“What we presented was that the food education program did significantly increase their sport nutrition knowledge,” Henry said. “We concluded that it’s warranted, that nutrition education should be incorporated into sports in high school. There’s absolutely a great need there, for sure.”

Henry, a recent recipient of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation General Scholarship, attended the academy’s annual conference in Philadelphia, where she presented her poster from the Fueling Fitness study. She also attended conference sessions focusing on pediatric dietetics.

“I went to several of the talks – educational sessions from dietitians that work in children’s hospitals, NICUs and in other settings that do research, especially in that NICU population,” she said. “I think that I probably would continue doing research, but likely more in quality improvement.”

Henry is regarded highly by Yunhee Chang, associate professor and graduate program director in the Department of Nutrition and Hospitality Management.

“Rebecca Henry is definitely one of the brightest students we’ve had in our program,” Chang said. “She is a strong student the classroom, as well as during her professional training in the community. It seems that excellence is in her nature.

“She is the type of student who scores 120 in the exams because while she is gifted, she keeps a humble attitude about learning. I am looking forward to seeing her making differences in people’s lives and becoming a leader in our profession.”

As part of the coordinated program, Henry is serving an internship at Traceway Retirement Center in Tupelo, doing clinical rotations.

“Seeing how it differs from acute clinical in a hospital setting versus long-term care has been really interesting to me, as well as seeing a shift in focus from short-term outcomes to more long-term outcomes and quality of life,” Henry said.

Henry knew she would ultimately end up working with children, even as an undergraduate, and hopes to go into pediatrics in the dietetics field. For three weeks in October, she participated in rotations at Batson Children’s Hospital in Jackson, spending one week in the NICU, one week in the pediatric in-patient clinic and one week in outpatient clinics.

“I really didn’t know what I wanted to do,” Henry said. “I just knew that I loved nutrition and I wanted to help attain a higher quality of life. As I’ve kind of gotten further into my study into supervised practice now, I want to make the biggest impact that I can, and I personally think that that is intervening at the earliest possible stages.

“So that’s where pediatrics comes in for me. There is something so special about it when I was down there at Batson, and it is just so touching. … It just kind of ignited an extra spark in me.”

Daniel Gustafson, FAO deputy director-general for programmes, shared from his experience facilitating large-scale FAO projects aimed at achieving sustainable development goals and global food security. He also highlighted the roles FAO and the United Nations play in crisis mitigation and supporting displaced people. The speech was part of the Global Engagement Lecture Series sponsored by the MSU International Institute.

Gustafson noted that FAO is interested in understanding the impacts of voluntary migration and forced migration, which is usually caused by conflict, climate shocks or economic issues. In recent decades, migration across countries has continued to increase.

“The UN projects 66 percent of the global population to be urban by 2050, which creates a massive need for urban employment,” Gustafson said, adding that food supply chains represent one area of employment growth potential.

In addition to impacting migration, crises have continued to play a significant role in food security issues, as most countries with dire food needs are countries with ongoing conflicts, Gustafson said. As international food systems become more complex, Gustafson complimented MSU’s interdisciplinary focus in addressing global challenges.

“Food security is often under a ministry of agriculture, nutrition under a minister of health, gender issues are often with a women’s ministry,” Gustafson said. “The problems are so interconnected that they have to have an interdisciplinary approach.”

MSU has a long-standing relationship with the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, with research partnerships focused on food safety, nutrition, aquatic animal health and agriculture, among other areas. The FAO and the World Food Programme have recognized MSU as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health. MSU President Mark E. Keenum, who holds an MSU doctoral degree in agricultural economics and who served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has made global food security a university research priority during his tenure at MSU.

MSU alumnus Richard A. Rula also will be awarded an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree during Starkville’s 1:30 p.m. April 30 ceremony for lifetime achievements and longtime major support of university programs. Rula, who earned a 1970 civil engineering degree from MSU’s Bagley College of Engineering, currently serves as president of Ridgeland-based Hemphill Construction Company, one of the Southeast’s leading multi-faceted contractors. He also has served on the boards of the MSU Foundation and the Bulldog Club, among others.

Rula was recognized as one of the Bagley college’s Distinguished Engineering Fellows in 2006 and its Alumnus of the Year in 2017. In 2019, he was recognized as the university’s National Alumnus of the Year. Rula and his wife Sherry provided the lead gift for MSU’s new Engineering and Science Complex, which is nearing completion and will be named in his honor. They also have endowed the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, which will be officially named the Richard A. Rula School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

The Rulas’ generous support also has had a major impact on the MSU student-athlete experience. They provided the lead gift for the Rula Tennis Pavilion, the new indoor complex for MSU men’s and women’s tennis teams, and also have supported the Mize Pavilion’s courts for MSU men’s and women’s basketball.

University leaders planning for the ceremonies said many elements of past graduations will be the same this spring; however, ongoing guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic are requiring several adjustments to the conventional program. An entrance processional for graduates will not be included, but all graduates will walk across the stage as they are announced and congratulated. Graduates will leave in successive order after being recognized instead of returning to their seats. Likewise, guests should leave after their graduate is recognized.

All graduates, guests and employees are expected to conduct self-screening prior to leaving home. Per MSU guidelines, this includes an “at-home” temperature check and review of potential COVID-19 symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, muscle pains, sore throat, and a new loss of taste or smell. Anyone with any of these symptoms or a fever of greater than 100.4 degrees should stay home.

Complete graduation details, as they become available, will be posted online at www.registrar.msstate.edu/students/graduation, as well as emailed directly to graduates, among other communications.

ANKENY, Iowa (DTN) -- The world will lose about 250 million crop production acres by 2050, according to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

The possibility of losing the equivalent of roughly two-thirds of the cultivated land in the United States is alarming, said Jerry Hatfield. But the director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment in Ames, Iowa, believes it can be prevented.

Hatfield said urbanization and soil degradation, from excessive tillage and other farming practices, are largely to blame for lost farm and ranch lands. People worldwide need to protect farm and ranch lands to feed a growing population, he said.

If society doesn't do a better job making land-use decisions and taking care of the soil, Hatfield is afraid hunger and food insecurity will be much more prevalent in 30 years when the world's population is expected to top 9 billion.

""If we look at the projected needs for food, feed and fiber, the productivity per unit of land is really going to have to increase,"" Hatfield said. ""To improve the stability of agriculture production going forward, we will have to improve and protect our soils.""

The American Farmland Trust (AFT), a non-profit organization committed to the protection of farmland, released ""Farms Under Threat: The State of the States"" earlier this year. The multi-year study identifies farm and ranchland acres lost to development and ways to protect it.

From 2001-2016, 11 million acres of agricultural land were paved over, converted or fragmented, according to the study. Roughly 4.4 million acres were classified as ""nationally significant,"" or the best land for food and crop production. About 2,000 acres of farm and ranchlands are developed per day, data indicates.","(DTN/Progressive Farmer photo by Matthew Putney)ANKENY, Iowa (DTN) -- The world will lose about 250 million crop production acres by 2050, according to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

May 09, 2018 - Payers are constantly challenged to provide their health plan beneficiaries the best possible healthcare experiences, but may have trouble doing that if members experience food insecurity.

Food security is just one lifestyle need that plays into a member’s social determinants of health. Beneficiaries may have housing, transportation access, and additional socioeconomic challenges that make it more difficult for members to prevent or manage chronic diseases.

Poor nutrition and inadequate food access affecting an alarming number of Americans, and can lead to the development of chronic diseases that are costly to treat. Beneficiaries may also live in areas called food deserts where the only food sources are fast food or similar meal options with poor nutritional value.

How can healthcare payers address food insecurity among their beneficiaries to improve wellness and decrease costs around chronic disease care?

How prevalent is food insecurity?

The most recent information from the USDA indicates that millions of Americans experience issues with food insecurity and accessing nutritional meal options.

In 2016, 12.3 percent of the US population was food insecure (51 million people). In the same year, 16.6 percent of households with children were food insecure. Food insecurity rates barely changed from 2015 when 12.7 percent of the population was food insecure.

A small percentage of households with children experienced some of the most extreme cases of food insecurity. In 0.8 percent of households with children (298,000 households), one or more children experienced disruptions in food intake and eating patterns.

The USDA also found that food insecurity is more common in certain demographics. Higher than average rates of food insecurity were found in:

Households with children and a single mother (31.6 percent)

Households with children and a single father (21.7 percent)

Households with incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty level (31.6 percent)

African American households (22.5 percent)

Data gathered by Feeding America found a greater number of food insecure areas in Southern regions of the US. An interactive map reveals that food insecure individuals may sometimes earn incomes that are just high enough to keep them from earning federal food assistance (SNAP benefits).

In Mississippi, 20 percent of individuals are food insecure. In addition, 30 percent of all individuals earn incomes above 135-185 percent of the federal poverty level, making them ineligible for SNAP benefits and could overlap into food insecure populations.

Similar food security barriers were found in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama.

Food insecurity correlates to chronic diseases

Food insecurity has a strong relationship to the development of costly chronic diseases such as COPD, diabetes, and asthma, according to the USDA’s Economic Research Service.

The probability of developing a chronic condition in a food insecure household is 56 percent, compared to 37.4 percent in food secure households. Food insecure individuals also have double the incidence of terminal diseases such as cancer, stroke, and kidney disease when compared to individuals with higher levels of food security.

The research team determined that food insecurity is a standalone factor when determining a person’s likelihood of developing a chronic disease.

“Low or very low food security could make it that much more difficult to live with cancer or diabetes, all other things being equal,” the team said. “The effort to understand these correlations is also an effort to understand the extra challenges faced by low-income adults with any degree of food insecurity.”

Food insecurity may also increase behaviors that lead to poor cardiometabolic health, an indicator of a person’s risk for developing diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.

Research conducted by the CDC and nutrition professionals at the University of Delaware nutritional experts found that food insecure groups were two times more likely to skip breakfast and 60 percent more likely to experience disruptive sleep patterns.

In addition, food insecure adolescents had a 65 percent increased likelihood of tobacco use compared to food secure peers. The findings indicate that food insecurity and nutritional issues may encourage individuals to participate in activities that negatively affect their health.

How payers can address food insecurity for their beneficiaries

Payers that want to address food insecurity need to partner with local organizations that specialize in food assistance for vulnerable individuals.

Local organizations may include food banks and pantries, farm sharing groups, advocacy groups, and related entities that provide meals to at-risk people. Payers could help these organizations by allocating payments and funding for meal sharing programs.

Health Partners Plans (HPP), a Philadelphia-area payer, developed the Food-as-Medicine program to address the relationship between chronic diseases and food insecure beneficiaries.

HPP partnered with a local group called Metropolitan Area Neighborhood Nutrition Alliance (MANNA) to provide food insecure members with 21 meals a week. HPP bundled the cost of meals per member based on expected healthcare outcomes.

The outcomes of the Food-as Medicine program included a 27 percent reduction in hospital admissions, a 6.9 percent reduction in ED visits, and a 15.9 percent reduction in provider visits.

For large commercial payers with millions of beneficiaries, community partnerships could help to identify and address the needs of members without regular access to nutritional choices.

Food insecurity is a major part of Humana’s Bold Goal initiative, the payer’s long-term strategy to address community-level social determinants of health.

Humana found that food insecure older beneficiaries are 50 percent more likely to develop diabetes, 14 percent more likely to develop high blood pressure, and 60 percent more likely to experience a heart attack.

The organization implemented meal sharing programs and food bank partnerships to address food insecurity for senior members.

Food insecurity issues for a payer may also be related to an overwhelming amount of beneficiaries living in food deserts. Payers may wish to investigate partnerships with nearby farms and organic produce wholesalers to give members healthier food options.

BlueCross BlueShield of Arizona addressed food deserts in their member groups through a mobile produce program to offer beneficiaries more healthy eating options.

The Nourishing Arizona program has provided over 220,000 meal products and provides members with cookbooks and educational materials about healthy dietary needs. The service has expanded to nearly 1000 food deserts within the state of Arizona.

Managing food security issues is likely to help payers combat the development of chronic diseases, manage rising healthcare costs, and create better healthcare opportunities for their members.","How can healthcare payers address food insecurity among their beneficiaries to improve wellness and decrease costs around chronic disease care?
