Anti-poverty groups said the administration’s focus on the unemployment rate was misleading.

“The overall unemployment rate is really a measure of the whole labor market and not people without a high school diploma who are incredibly poor and may lack transportation,” said Stacy Dean, the vice president for food assistance policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We’re talking about a different group who just face a very different labor market.”

The rule is the first of three Agriculture Department efforts to scale back the food stamp program, and so far, Trump administration officials appear unmoved by the protests flooding in. More than 140,000 public comments were submitted on the rule that was made final on Wednesday, and they were overwhelmingly negative.

“The Trump administration is driving the vulnerable into hunger just as the Christmas season approaches,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday. “It is heartless. It is cruel. It exposes a deep and shameful cruelness and hypocrisy in this administration.”

The department has also proposed a rule that would close what it calls a loophole that allows people with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four — to receive food stamps. The rule would also prevent households with more than $2,250 in assets, or $3,500 for a household with a disabled adult, from receiving food stamps. Those changes would strip nearly three million people of their benefits, the department said, and nearly one million children would lose automatic eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals. The proposal received 75,000 public comments, which were overwhelmingly negative.","Under the rule, effective April 1, 2020, an area eligible for a waiver would have to have a 24-month average unemployment rate that is not only 20 percent above the national average but also at least 6 percent.

-----------

Following the massive ICE operation in Mississippi on Aug. 7, many children are left without a mother or father and have nowhere to go.

But a community in Forest, Mississippi, is coming together with a temporary solution.

The children, some who are just toddlers, were relying on neighbors and even strangers to pick them up outside their homes after school and drive them to a community fitness center where people tried to keep them calm.

But many kids kept crying for mom and dad.

Fighting back tears, 11-year-old Magdalena Gomez Gregorio expressed to us her devastation being alone without her dad.

""Government please show some heart, let my parent be free and everyone else,"" she said.

This came after ice agents raided several food processing plants in Mississippi, arresting 680 people believed to be in the country illegally.

""While we are a nation of immigrants, more than that we are first and foremost a nation of laws,"" said Southern District U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst.

But those children and families impacted by each raid stressed their parents and friends are good people.

""I need my dad and mommy. My dad didn't do anything, he's not a criminal,"" said Magdalena.

""The children that I'm with, their moms been here for 15 years and she has no record. A lot of people here have no record they've been here for 10-12 years,"" said Christina Peralta, godmother of kids impacted.

For Christina Peralta, who's the godmother of two children who's mom was arrested, she's helpless as she watches the boys wonder when they'll see their mother again.

""He said his mom is gone, that he's upset with Trump. He said he just wants his mom back and they've been crying all day long since they got home from school,"" Peralta.

But with the help of Clear Creek Boot Camp owner Jordan Barnes and other community leaders, the kids will have a roof to sleep under at his gym for the night with donated food to eat.

""We're going to have bedding available for them and we're going to have food available for them just to get them through the night and if they need transportation to school tomorrow we'll also take care of that,"" said Barnes.

And in times like these, he stresses that you cannot forget the children through this.

""I understand the law and how everything works and everything needs to have a system, but everybody needs to hold the kids first and foremost in their minds. And that's what we've tried to do here is give them a place to stay and ease the pain a little bit,"" Barnes said.

According to the Associated Press, dozens of immigrant workers have already been released.

Officials had said Wednesday that they would release detainees who met certain conditions, such as pregnant women or those who hadn't faced immigration proceedings previously.","But a community in Forest, Mississippi, is coming together with a temporary solution.

2,"th · Aug 9, 2019",Reuters,Allegations of labor abuses dogged Mississippi plant years before immigration raids,"(Reuters) - Long before U.S. immigration authorities arrested 680 people at agricultural processing facilities in Mississippi this week, one of the five targeted companies faced allegations of serious labor violations including intimidation, harassment and exploitation of its largely immigrant work force, according to a federal lawsuit.

Last August, Illinois-based poultry supplier Koch Foods settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of more than 100 workers at the Morton, Mississippi, plant over claims the company knew - or should have known - of sexual and physical assaults against its Hispanic workers.

Mark Kaminsky, chief operating officer at Koch, said the company admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and maintains, after fighting the matter in court for more than eight years, that all the allegations contained in the lawsuit are false.

The workers’ complaints spanned 2004 to 2008, when the plant employed more than 500 people. They alleged that a manager would grope women from behind while they were working, punch employees and throw chicken parts at them. Workers also alleged that supervisors coerced payments from them for everything from medical leave and promotions to bathroom breaks.

Privately held Koch Foods, run by billionaire Joseph Grendys, in court filings called the claims of abuse and harassment “baffling” and “outrageous.” Kaminsky said a third-party review of 9 months of 24-hour video surveillance at the plant found “absolutely no evidence” of their veracity. Koch said the plaintiffs made uncorroborated claims against the company as a means to obtain U.S. visas for crime victims who collaborate with U.S. authorities that would allow them to stay legally in the United States.

The company settled the allegations last year by paying $3.75 million and entering a three-year consent decree to prevent future violations. It agreed to implement new policies such as creating a 24-hour complaint hotline and publicly posting anti-discrimination policies, according to the EEOC.

Some workers at the Mississippi plant who lacked legal immigration status alleged in court documents that supervisors threatened to turn them in to authorities if they spoke out about their concerns.

Former federal officials and immigration attorneys said mass deportation operations like the ones conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday in Mississippi can have a chilling effect on future labor complaints.

“If workers are being threatened with being turned over to ICE, and then here comes ICE and arrests workers,” people could be more reluctant to speak up, said John Sandweg, a former acting ICE director during the Obama administration.

In the EEOC lawsuit, one Koch Foods employee without legal immigration status alleged that a manager sexually harassed his wife and made him pay to use the bathroom, once waiting until he had soiled himself to give him permission to leave his spot on the production line.

“If he found out that I had talked about anything that he was doing, charging money, the way he mistreated us, the dirty words he used; he told me that if I went to complain in the office that he had contacts in immigration,” the worker said in a 2012 deposition that was filed as part of the suit. “And that he knew where I lived.”

Maria Cazorla, a Cuban immigrant and lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the company that was wrapped into the EEOC case, said in an interview on Thursday that a manager inappropriately touched her and hit her then-husband, also a co-worker, in the ribs while he was working.

According to Cazorla’s interview and court documents, her husband at the time was targeted by management and fired over his immigration status after she filed her lawsuit against the company in 2010. Cazorla, now a U.S. citizen, left the company and Mississippi and now renovates houses in Florida.

She said immigrants are often fearful of reporting abuse. “People are afraid to come forward because they think, ‘What will happen if I say something? I’ll be separated from my family, I’ll lose my job,’” Cazorla said. “They prefer to say nothing and suffer.”

The EEOC enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and can investigate employee complaints. The agency tries to settle the claims but, if unsuccessful, it can file a lawsuit against employers for workplace discrimination.

Marsha Rucker, EEOC Regional Attorney based in Birmingham, Alabama, who oversaw the lawsuit, said she did not believe the ICE action this week was connected to the EEOC’s civil complaint.

SCENES OF MASS ARRESTS

The dramatic operation on Wednesday was the biggest workplace immigration sweep since December 2006, when ICE targeted meatpacking plants in six states and arrested almost 1,300 people.

Some children of workers were left traumatized by their parents’ detention on what was for many the first day of school, according to local media reports.

“Government, please,” an 11-year-old girl said on a CBS News segment, weeping in front of a community center where she and other children were sent to spend the night. “My dad didn’t do nothing. He’s not a criminal.”

President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration and said on Friday that actions like the one this week served “as a very good deterrent” to those in the country illegally. “When people see what they saw,” he said, “they know that they’re not staying here.”

ICE officials told reporters on a call on Thursday that they had released 303 people for humanitarian reasons - if they were pregnant or a primary caretaker of children, for example. Among those released pending a hearing before an immigration judge were 18 “juveniles” who had been working in the plants, including one 14-year-old, ICE said.

Koch Foods said in a statement on its website dated Thursday that it was cooperating with the government’s ongoing investigation following the ICE arrests. Koch said the Morton, Mississippi, plant employs more than 1,000 people and that the company is “diligent about its compliance with state and federal employment eligibility laws.”

The company has been the target of ICE work site enforcement in the past.

In August 2007, immigration agents arrested more than 160 employees of a Koch Foods chicken plant in Fairfield, Ohio, and was fined around a half a million dollars. At the time, ICE said Koch Foods was being investigated for federal crimes including encouraging, inducing or harboring immigrants in the United States illegally.

Koch Foods, which according to its website is not affiliated with Koch Industries or the Koch brothers, started with 13 employees deboning and cutting up chicken in one room in 1985. It now counts more than 13,000 employees and bills itself as one of the biggest poultry processors in the United States, with facilities in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and Illinois, as well as Mississippi.

In a letter to the White House, the National Chicken Council - a lobbying group - said the poultry industry “uses every tool available to verify the identify and legal immigration status of all prospective employees.” But it said there was no government system available to “confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in the United States.”","Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Handout via REUTERS/File PhotoLast August, Illinois-based poultry supplier Koch Foods settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by the U.S.

4,"Feb 26, 2020",Jackson Free Press,Jackson's Food Insecurity Focus in April Expo,"In a state where one in four children go to bed hungry at night, solutions to the food insecurity that plagues Jackson and other southern cities are the goal of a series of public art installations and workshops. The Fertile Ground Expo, scheduled for April 9-11, aims to address the history and future of food access in Mississippi and beyond.

""We know when you are hungry, you can't perform at your best,"" Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at a press conference Tuesday in downtown Jackson. ""Hunger is a problem that reaches beyond one's belly but affects every aspect of a person's way of life, which ultimately impacts how we function as a society.""

Agriculture may be the state's leading industry, but Mississippi remains one of the hungriest in the country, Salam Rida pointed out at the presser. She is a program manager for the expo and an urban designer for the City of Jackson.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" In a recent report, the department revealed that more than 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2018.

Mississippi has consistently ranked as one of the most food-insecure states in the nation. Between 2010 and 2018, the state ranked No. 1 in food insecurity. It also has the highest poverty rate.

One in four Mississsippians—more than 600,000 people—experience food insecurity. The issue is especially profound for the state's elderly population and children. Half the state's senior population does not have enough to eat, and about 25% of Mississippi's children go to sleep hungry.

The Mississippi Food Network reports that in Hinds County alone, nearly 62,000 people have too little to eat—more than the entire food-insecure population of North Dakota.

Food insecurity has multiple adverse health impacts, ranging from developmental problems for young people to difficulties concentrating in school. Given that nutritious foods tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods, families struggling with food access are more likely to eat foods that are detrimental to their overall physical health. Experts also link food insecurity to additional problems such as housing access and inadequate access to medical care.

The USDA notes that a number of state-level factors affect the degree to which a state experiences food insecurity. These include wages, housing costs and unemployment as well as ""State-level policies that affect access to unemployment insurance, the State Earned Income Tax Credit, and nutrition assistance programs.""

""The goal of the expo weekend is not only to be critical of our existing food system, but to provide new ideas and solutions for developing a more food-secure environment for southern cities,"" Rida said.

Scheduled to take place in various Jackson neighborhoods experiencing food-access issues, the Fertile Ground Expo will bring together prominent area and national chefs, nutritionists, farmers, activists, artists, and policy makers for workshops, dialogues and exhibits related to food. More than 30 events will tackle topics including the history of food insecurity, how to ferment food, urban farming, food waste, the food traditions of Farish Street, the impact of food insecurity on families and more.

The event is free.

Participants include acclaimed artist Kara Walker, chef and food writer Mark Bittman, local chef Nick Wallace and interdisciplinary Mississippi artist Adrienne Domnick.

The mayor thanked Bloomberg Philanthropy for its $1-million gift to organize the expo. In 2018, Jackson became one of five cities that the philanthropic organization selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants as part of its Public Art Challenge competition. At the Feb. 25 press conference, Lumumba added that Bloomberg Philanthropy work was independent of Mike Bloomberg's campaign for the presidency, while emphasizing the need to focus on the problem of hunger.

""We live in a world of abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity. In our society, there is no room or justification for anyone to go hungry, for anyone not to have access to healthy food options,"" the mayor said at the press conference, adding that food is how Mississippians show love in their communities.

""Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. In spaces where people often have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you and provide you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. As a city, we should return the love,"" he said.

As thousands of Mississippians face layoffs or income cuts from the economic fallout of coronavirus, the state's welfare agency is taking action to support families on food assistance programs.

The Mississippi Department of Human Services announced on Monday that recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will begin receiving the maximum amount of SNAP funds allowable — regardless of what they were entitled to receive under normal circumstances.

A press release from the agency explained if a single person was currently getting $100 in SNAP benefits, that person will now automatically get the maximum monthly amount for a single person: $194.

This emergency supplement will apply to March and April benefits, according to the release.

“Our primary commitment is, and always will be, helping Mississippi families when they need it most, especially during this time when so many lives are being affected,” MDHS Executive Director Bob Anderson said in the release. “We will continually make every effort to provide assistance to children and families who need it, especially in the face of the unprecedented effects of this pandemic.”

If you or your family is already receiving SNAP benefits, this bump will happen automatically.

Families who qualify for SNAP benefits and are not currently receiving them are encouraged to apply by going to www.mdhs.ms.gov/applications. Applicants can also apply via mail, the press release said, though this will delay the process.

Here are the amounts of monthly SNAP benefits available under the emergency supplement, broken down by the number of people in the household:

1: $194

2: $355

3: $509

4: $646

9,"Aug 13, 2019",Atlanta Journal Constitution,Poultry company raided by ICE in Mississippi also operates in Georgia,"ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said he would not discuss if and when his agency would carry out similar enforcement in Georgia.

“While we cannot speculate to the future, at present it does not encompass any locations in Georgia,” he said.

Federal authorities executed search warrants at seven sites across Mississippi last week, arresting 680 people suspected of being in the country illegally. Of those, 303 were placed in deportation proceedings and released from custody and 377 are still detained at facilities in Louisiana and Mississippi. The arrests, according to ICE, stemmed from a yearlong investigation.

ICE said in court records that the Koch Foods plant in Morton drew the agency’s attention after it tracked unauthorized immigrants to that location, using coordinates from federal electronic monitoring ankle bracelets.

In 2006 in Georgia, federal authorities raided a chicken processing plant in Stillmore and several homes in and around Emanuel County in east Georgia. More than 120 people suspected of being in the country illegally, mostly men, were arrested.

Afterward, many people went into hiding or left town, failing to show up for their jobs at the lumber yards, steel mills and produce companies across the county and in neighboring communities. Many women and children were left behind, some without resources. Small local businesses reported suffering losses.

Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, fears Georgia could experience something like that again following the events in Mississippi.

“If we were to remove undocumented workers from the picture, our poultry industry would collapse in Georgia,” he said. “Our economy would take a serious hit, and it would be destructive to families all around this state.”

Georgia's poultry industry — it employs tens of thousands of workers across the state and generates billions of dollars in economic activity — follows state and federal employment laws, said Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation, a trade association.

“My members are literally doing everything they can with the tools they have at their disposal to ensure they are hiring a legal workforce,” he said.

The National Chicken Council, a nonprofit trade group that represents the broiler chicken industry, sent President Donald Trump a letter Friday, saying ""the government does not provide employers with a reliable verification method to prevent identity fraud and document falsification and confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in the United States.""

Also on Friday, three Democratic congressmen — including Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi — asked the Trump administration to turn over documents about the costs of the raids, how many people were detained and how many families with children were split up.

The issue has already resonated among several of the Democrats running to represent Georgia’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses Cumming and rural portions of Forsyth County. Some shared stories on social media of the children whose parents were taken by federal agents during the Mississippi raids. And some, including party activist Nabilah Islam and state Rep. Brenda Lopez Romero, said what happened in Mississippi underscores the need for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.

""If you like to eat vegetables or any meat, you're relying on the fact that that food is available because of undocumented labor,"" said Lopez Romero, an immigration attorney who has put the issue at the heart of her bid for Congress. The way to ""minimize the effects on U.S. citizen children is by making sure we have a pathway to regularizing one's status (for their parents) so there's an actual line to get into.""

U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, who represents a largely rural southwest Georgia district, said he is concerned because “Georgia produces more poultry than any other state in the nation, and the poultry industry, and most of agriculture, rely heavily on immigrant and guest worker labor. We need a comprehensive immigration bill that will ensure agriculture employers have the legal workers that they need to keep American agriculture the most productive in the world.”

When the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.

Many children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.

“We absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,” he said. “We have to do it on behalf of our children. It’s just that simple. Families are suffering here.”

“If there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we’re providing for all children.

The novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America’s most food-insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food-insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.

As the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages – two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.

‘This is getting so much harder’

His mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.

“With the money that we do have we’ve got to try and pay the bills,” she said. “And when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.”

At the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.

Quick Guide How you can help US food banks in the Covid-19 pandemic Show How to help Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help. Donate money or supplies The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families. If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund. Volunteers Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice. Social media Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.

“This is getting so much harder,” she said. “We’re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.”

Holmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.

Zelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call-in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices – in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.

“I couldn’t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,” she said. “So I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said ‘I’m not paying’. My brain just melted because I was so upset.”

In a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington’s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.

“If people have a problem they should report it to the attorney general of Mississippi,” he said. “We’re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.”

Mississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared with other hotspots in the US – particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.

As the school bus food drop-offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.

“I pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,” Reeves said.

But the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.

“Hunger is rampant here,” said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. “Six hundred thousand were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.”

The network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state’s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.

“We have more phone calls than we can handle,” Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.

‘It’s like a scavenger hunt’

In Jackson, the state’s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods.

Like Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pickup meal service there are no drop-offs here.

April Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.

Volunteers from the Poor People’s Campaign, and Operation Good – a local collective of activists – have been organizing hot food drop-offs at this low-income apartment complex, for the past week.

“It’s like a scavenger hunt,” Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. “People are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.”

She lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.

“I just took it,” she said. “I bought a block of cheese. That was it.”","Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection.

11,1 week ago,Direct Relief,"In Mississippi, Working to Treat Food Insecurity","At one of the oldest community health centers in the country – that’s Delta Health Center in Mississippi – there’s a story about a famous doctor who used to write prescriptions for food.

Dr. Jack Geiger, the founding father of the community health center movement, would send his patients to the grocery store to get healthy food. The grocer would fill the order and send the bill to the health center.

Someone told Geiger that food couldn’t be prescribed. Geiger retorted that the best cure he knew for malnutrition was food.

Robin Boyles, who’s now the chief program planning and development officer at Delta, said that treating food insecurity “really does go back to our very, very early days…You can treat someone for an illness or infection, but if you’re sending them home and they don’t have food to eat and they don’t have clean drinking water and they don’t have sanitation, they’re not going to get well.”

Food insecurity is on the rise across the United States. In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average. A 2019 study from the USDA’s Economic Research Service found that the state had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country – 15.7% of the population experienced it.

And the state’s community health centers are coming together to do something about it – together with the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi and Direct Relief. Direct Relief provided the health center association with a $250,000 grant designed to fight hunger among Mississippi’s most vulnerable.

The result is the Cornbread Cooking Series, a program that’s designed to both increase access to food and teach people how to buy and prepare food that’s healthy and good to eat. Six Mississippi health centers will introduce or build on existing programs around food access and education.

“It’s Southern and everybody loves cornbread…it’s winter and it’s comfort,” said Janice Sherman, the association’s CEO.

But despite the homey name, Sherman is focused on new cooking techniques as well as food access. “I thought it would be an opportunity to really introduce some new areas of spices and things that will really be better for our diets,” she said.

Patients are screened for food insecurity. If they qualify, they’re referred to the program, which provides a combination of education, activities, and food vouchers or other access to healthy, nutritious food.

Sherman explained that health centers, as trusted community resources, are in an especially good position to deliver help and education. “For a provider who’s your doctor to address the fact that you need food is pretty powerful,” she said.

Three health centers participating in the program sat down with Direct Relief to talk about hunger, healthy cooking, and how they’ll use the funding.

For Patients with HIV, Closing the Cracks

At G.A. Carmichael Family Health Center, dietician Kyskie Bolton explained that there are a number of patients who are “dramatically food insecure, but don’t fall into any category where they would get significant assistance.”

In participating in the Cornbread Cooking Series, G.A. Carmichael wanted to focus on the patients who most needed intervention – in this case, by focusing on patients dealing with both food insecurity and HIV/AIDS.

Some of those patients have comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes as well.

Bolton explained that HIV-positive patients often don’t want anyone to know their diagnosis. “They will protect it at all costs, even at the cost of their hunger or nutritional health,” she said. “These are the type of patients who are going to fall through the cracks.”

G.A. Carmichael is preparing videos of healthy cooking techniques – how to prepare vegetables, for example – and a supermarket tour, to show patients who qualify for the program how to shop around the edges of the grocery store for the healthiest food.

The goal, Bolton said, is “increasing their literacy and empowering them to make better decisions so they can utilize what they have.”

The health center is also working with nearby farmers to acquire and distribute produce to patients with chronic diseases – a long-term enterprise that the funding will help them continue. Active participants in the program will also receive vouchers and gift cards to nearby grocery stores.

For Bolton, part of the challenge is reaching a diverse patient population – one that’s both rural and relatively urban, and that includes a range of ethnicities and backgrounds – and produce materials and messaging that will appeal to everyone.

However, the population does have one thing in common: “Most people here are extremely technologically advanced and don’t have much to do with cornbread,” Bolton said.

Reducing Childhood Obesity

For Dr. Wendy Williams, a pediatrician at Coastal Family Health Center, an interest in increasing food access came about when she noticed a correlation between food insecurity and obesity in the children in her practice.

“Until we started asking the questions, I had no idea how pervasive [food insecurity] is down here,” she said. “You can’t get to the bottom of pediatric obesity until you conquer that, or at least make some dents.”

The health center started by planting a vegetable garden to teach kids about healthy food. It met an enthusiastic reception: Williams said that one child described a radish as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen before putting it in his pocket to preserve it. Another was anxious to learn to grow food – his uncle, he told Williams, didn’t have enough to eat.

The Cornbread Cooking Series grant will help Coastal Family Health Center expand its program, reaching out to local farmers to acquire excess produce for patients, and launching a cooking education series.

“Down in the South we like to do things with a lot of fat and salt, so really being cognizant of that and teaching them to use other things to make food taste good,” such as herbs, will be a priority, Williams said. “It’s definitely a mindset. You have to change how people view it.”

The health center also plans to develop food boxes, working with a local food bank to get protein sources for patients and with a produce distributor to get fruits and vegetables.

But throughout it all, the community garden remains a fixture.

“You don’t even think you’re making that big a difference in the community,” Williams said. But feedback from patients – and enthusiasm for what the garden produces – have changed her mind.

“We’re teaching kids that, from the very beginning, they can be self-reliant,” she said.

Going back to the beginning

Between the pandemic and the winter storms that blanketed large swathes of the U.S. in February, need is especially high among Delta Health Center’s patients, said Neuaviska Stidhum, the health center’s chief operating officer and chief nursing officer.

“Right now, we’re in crisis,” she said. “We really want to be able to just get the hunger out, to provide for them so they won’t have that hunger.”

Since the 1960s, Delta Health Center has played a role in alleviating hunger among its patients. The health center currently has six acres of land – cultivated by a local university – that it uses to provide a range of fresh produce, from greens and sweet potatoes to fresh fruits.

Stidhum explained that, while many of their patients qualify for public assistance, it’s often not enough, or too far away to be accessible for people who don’t have transportation.

“It’s really difficult for some of our more rural patients…especially if they don’t have transportation and have to depend on someone else,” Boyles said.

The grant will be used to provide much-needed food vouchers to patients, and health providers will give patients supplemental information about how to choose and eat healthy food that won’t break the bank.

Stidhum has hopes for a kitchen in the health center someday. For the time being, providers will refer patients to cooking videos, health services, and other resources.

“We’re just going back to the beginning, to help the people any way we can,” she said.","In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average.

15,"Jun 10, 2020",Civil Eats,"‘Fertile Ground’ Explores How Jackson, Mississippi, Is Charting a Better Food Future","Obesity. Poverty. Food Insecurity.

Mississippi has the dubious distinction of ranking high nationally in each of these interlinked categories. With the exception of New Mexico, the Magnolia State is the most food insecure place in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents. The film, directed by Alex Warren, with executive producer Robby Piantanida, airs tonight at 7 p.m. Central Time on Mississippi PBS and is also available online at PBS.org.

“There is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement about the film. “In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people.”

Fertile Ground, which was funded in part by a grant from the Bloomberg Foundation, shows how historic redlining—a practice in which banks prevented people of color from buying mortgages in white neighborhoods—resulted in the mostly Black and impoverished neighborhood of South Jackson having few grocery stores but several convenience stores with low-quality food. The city’s car culture and lack of sidewalks and bicycle lanes add to the problem, making it a herculean task for residents without vehicles to obtain nutrient-rich food. And children in Jackson’s most economically disadvantaged areas rely on school cafeterias to get balanced meals. In Mississippi, 1 in 4 children experiences hunger, compared to 1 in 5 adults.

In the wake of these challenges, urban farms, city planning projects, farm-to-table restaurants, and efforts to provide residents with locally grown food offer hope that food equality in Jackson is possible. Fertile Ground isn’t just a film, but an initiative that aims to shape policy and public dialogue about food access and nutrition through art, workshops, panel discussions, and other events.

Civil Eats spoke with Jackson chef Enrika Williams, a Fertile Ground workshop facilitator, and Travis Crabtree, a Jackson-based urban designer and Fertile Ground project manager, about the new documentary, redlining, urban farming, and the food inequities their city faces.

How does the layout of Jackson contribute to food inequality?

Travis Crabtree. Travis Crabtree.

Travis Crabtree: Whenever you have a city that is extremely car oriented, obviously you have accessibility issues, especially when you have neighborhoods that don’t have good public transportation, low car ownership, and no sidewalks—which is the reality for a lot of Jackson. Jackson started being built from the core, which is downtown Jackson, and then over time, you had white flight and people started to leave the city. That’s when all the grocery stores left.

It’s a very typical pattern in American cities. It has happened all over the country, but Jackson is a place that’s already dealing with extreme poverty, racial tensions, and [less] access to resources. When it comes to food insecurity, it’s super exacerbated here.

The documentary discusses how poverty in some Jackson neighborhoods played a role in supermarkets leaving. Why do you think that is?

Enrika Williams. Enrika Williams.

Enrika Williams: You can find plenty of convenience stores that have decided to take EBT because people in the community who are using food assistance need a place to spend their money so they can eat. But the larger grocery store chains are in the business of making money, and capitalists are not empathetic to anything but . . . making money. So, if the majority of the people who come into your stores are on some sort of public assistance, you look at the bottom line and think, “I’m not making any money.”

I also think there’s a stigma attached to public assistance recipients. Stores don’t want to appear to be accommodating to a demographic of EBT recipients. There’s also an insurance standpoint: It costs more to put your grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. It’s like another form of redlining.

How does the history of redlining play a role in the city’s present-day food landscape?

Crabtree: It’s really clear what lines divide Jackson—the train yard, the interstate, and these other sorts of urban barriers, even institutions like colleges or hospitals. They act as really large barriers that are disconnecting the white neighborhoods from Black neighborhoods. And generally the white neighborhoods are the ones that have the grocery stores and are more affluent.

Redlining obviously exists in most American cities, but it’s so apparent here. One thing that we’ve done outside of the documentary is we have a major public art component. We’ve tried to position our public art installations at the intersections of the redlines to bring the two communities together. We’re putting them right up against the railroad tracks and the different sort of segregation points to try to have conversations about what an integrated Jackson would be like.","The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents.

16,"Jun 9, 2020",CNN,Groceries were hard to find for millions. Now it's getting even worse,"New York (CNN Business) The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and limited delivery slots for online groceries.

But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

In 2015, an estimated 39 million people, or 12.8% of the US population, lived in ""low income and low access areas,"" according to the USDA's most recent data

The areas are defined as those where a ""significant"" portion of the population lives more than a mile from the nearest supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles away in rural areas. The poverty rate is either 20% or greater, or the median-family income is below or equal to 80% of the statewide median family income.

Such areas are commonly known as food deserts, even though the term has no official meaning. it's increasingly difficult for the people who live in them to buy food.

During the pandemic, grocers have cut back their operating hours. Public transportation has been reduced, and riders who once traveled to stores in other neighborhoods or cities can no longer do so. Some older or higher-risk populations are fearful of traveling during the pandemic.

There's also evidence that food accessibility challenges are growing. In Georgia, the number of residents now living in ""food insecure"" areas has jumped 69% since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data firm Urban Footprint. The firm uses an index, including jobless claims, pre-existing health conditions, and access to grocery stores and healthy food, to measure food security — or ""reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritionally adequate food.""

In Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky the number of residents living in food insecure areas has spiked 43%, 36% and 118% respectively, driven by the rise in unemployment, according to the analysis

The pandemic has made it ""very cumbersome"" to buy groceries, said Yolanda Jackson, who lives 1.6 miles from her nearest grocery store in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2018, 23.5% of Baltimore residents lived in an area where access to healthy food is limited.

Jackson usually takes the bus to Shoppers grocery store, but stopped during the pandemic in part because of the long waits. She has been going to corner stores and bodegas ""where the selections are low and the prices are high,"" she said.

Online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who rely on food stamps.

s minorities. The problem of food access disproportionately affectminorities. Research from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that lower-income minority neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores compared with similar white neighborhoods.

""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data.

'Online grocery shopping is not equal'

Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce, public health experts say.

Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.

""With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than processed items,"" said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes.

During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online.

Amazon AMZN Walmart WMT In states that do allow recipients to use their benefits online, their options are usually onlyor, which have gaps in where they deliver groceries to customers' home. And some deliveries have minimum purchase requirements or added shipping fees, which can be a barrier for low-income customers.

""Access to online grocery shopping is not equal,"" said Caitlin Caspi, assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Rep. Sanford Bishop, chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Subcommittee, wrote to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue last week urging the department to expand the number of grocers eligible to participate in the online program. ""Of the approved retailers, only two are national chains and only one of the national retailers can reach our most rural communities,"" Bishop said.

As food access challenges swell during the pandemic, cities, food banks, schools and community organizations are trying to find creative solutions.

""The public school system and many charter and private schools are continuing to offer meals to children and some of our urban farmers and chefs are teaming up to make meals for people in their neighborhoods who are in need of food,"" said Winona Bynum from the Detroit Food Policy Council.

In Baltimore, the city has developed an emergency response strategy. It's working to expand residents' participation in the food stamp program, which allows for online purchasing in the state of Maryland. The city has also ramped up delivering boxes of shelf-stable groceries and produce to residents' homes.","But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

18,"Dec 21, 2020",CNBC,Lawmakers allocate $13 billion to food assistance programs in an effort to alleviate hunger crisis,"Lawmakers agreed to a $900 billion coronavirus relief package on Sunday, which includes $13 billion in funding to support food assistance programs, at a time when demand and lines at food pantries around the country are reaching record levels.

About 13% of Americans, or 27.4 million people, reported they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat on a weekly basis, according to the latest Household Pulse Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 16. About 14 million households with children report not having enough to eat.

It's a situation lawmakers hope to improve. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a hunger crisis that has touched every part of our nation,"" Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry said in a statement Sunday. ""I am relieved that help is on the way and I look forward to continuing to do more in the new year to help Americans through this continuing crisis.""

Sunday's funding deal includes a 15% increase to the maximum SNAP benefits for six months through June 30, 2021, a move that many advocates were calling for. The increase amounts to a boost of about $25 per person each month.

The average SNAP benefit per person was $125 per month during the fiscal year 2020, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's about $1.39 per person per meal.

Roughly 6 to 7 million more people have applied and been approved for SNAP benefits since February, according to available data analyzed by CBPP. Nationally, that's about a 17% increase. About 25.3 million Americans total reported currently receiving SNAP benefits in the latest Census Household Pulse survey.

The latest relief package also expands SNAP eligibility to college students and excludes unemployment benefits from being counted as income when it comes to SNAP benefits. Additionally, U.S. territories including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa — which are not eligible for SNAP — will receive $614 million for nutrition grants.

The bill will also expand food access for children, including allowing any child under 6 to be deemed ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits under the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program. The program provides families with a voucher to purchase groceries to replace the breakfasts and lunches their children miss when schools and child-care centers are closed or only offering remote learning.

Congress reauthorized the program on Oct. 1, but it took the U.S. Department of Agriculture six weeks to establish the new guidelines for the program, meaning that states only started applying for funds this month.

Under the latest bipartisan deal, food banks also will receive $400 million in funding through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, will receive $175 million.

""Our network of member food banks across the country are witnessing unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for charitable food assistance,"" Kate Leone, Feeding America's chief government relations officer, said in a statement last week. ""Families are making impossible decisions between paying the rent and putting food on the table while food banks are working tirelessly to keep up with the increased need.""

The $13 billion in funding would provide ""limited but immediate help,"" Leone said, adding that more federal funding and assistance would likely be needed in the future. ""As always, and especially during this crisis, the simple truth is that charity alone cannot solve food insecurity.""

Read Stateline coverage of the latest state action on coronavirus.

Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify the California Department of Food and Agriculture's role in the Farm to Family program.

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a longstanding initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and supported by the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

“All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,” said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. “When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.”

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts Quick View Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts A U.S.-China trade deal is falling short on its commitments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don’t have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic’s early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

“If food banks can’t take more product [from the California program], farmers are going to go out of business,” Linkhart said. “That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.”

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

“That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,” said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. “It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.”

Raudabaugh said the state’s dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers’ distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don’t make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

“We’re providing many hundreds of percents more [to food banks] than pre-pandemic,” Raudabaugh said. “Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these [partnerships]. It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.”

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

“The money has to be there to justify the harvest,” Michael said, “and this solves some of that problem.”

Washington’s Work

On Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen’s small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers’ pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

“It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,” Van Laanen said. “It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.”

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he’s already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi’s Farm stay afloat.

“It was really timely,” Chichester said. “It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early timeframe.”

Karen Affeld, the development group’s executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

“Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,” she said. “That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.”

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state’s Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California’s that launched in 2014.

It’s a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they’re harvesting crops bound for food banks.

“Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,” said David Bobanick, the group’s executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another four pounds are donated by farmers.

“Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,” he said. “It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.”

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

“Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,” said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets’ food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she’s heard from parents who couldn’t otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

Making Connections

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture — known as CSA — in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program’s website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

“You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,” said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. “People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.”

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

“We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,” Lebeaux said. “Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.”

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

“We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,” said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. “One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.”

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

“If there’s one silver lining,” she said, “it’s that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.”","And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

JACKSON, Miss. — Mississippi is considering new rules that let companies continue to use food-labeling terms such as “veggie burger” and “vegan bacon,” as long as the terms are prominently displayed so consumers understand the products are not meat.

The state agriculture department on Thursday proposed new regulations for plant-based products that are sold as alternatives to meat.

The regulations were published weeks after a nonprofit organization that advocates plant-based foods and an Illinois food company sued Mississippi over a labeling law. The suit was filed on July 1, the same day the state enacted the law saying that “a plant-based or insect-based food product shall not be labeled as meat or a meat food product.”

................................................................

Meat producers have been trying to protect meat terminology by pushing for state laws that restrict labeling of products such as meatless meatballs.

Makers of plant-based foods have also sued Missouri and Arkansas over labeling laws.

The proposed Mississippi regulations say terms such as “plant-based” must be clearly displayed on packaging of products such as vegetarian hot dogs. The rules will be open for public comment for nearly a month. Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson told The Associated Press on Friday that if there are no changes needed after the comment period, he will issue an order for the regulations to take effect.

“They’re commonsense rules,” Gipson said. “We’re doing exactly what we intended to do.”

Gipson said the regulations do not weaken the food labeling law, and he said terms like “veggie burger” were never going to be illegal. He said while many products are already clearly labeled, the law is aimed at those that are designed to deceive consumers.

“That whole lawsuit has been a waste of time,” Gipson said. Speaking of groups that filed it, Gipson said: “They’re just trying to raise money.”

The lawsuit was filed by Plant Based Foods Association and Illinois-based Upton’s Naturals Co., which makes vegan products and sells them in many states. Both are represented in the suit by the Mississippi Justice Institute and the Virginia-based Institute for Justice.

The lawsuit is still active, but the two groups issued statements Friday saying the proposed regulations are a victory for the First Amendment.

“It shouldn’t be a crime for plant-based food companies to describe their products in a way that everyone understands,” Mississippi Justice Institute director Aaron Rice said.

Institute of Justice attorney Justin Pearson said: “Our lawsuit made it clear that subjecting plant-based food companies to possible criminal prosecution for using common terms on their labels would be a violation of their free speech rights.”

Spokesmen for both groups said the lawsuit could be dropped if the regulations take effect as currently written.

The Mississippi law also says “cultured animal tissue” made in a lab from animal cells may not be labeled as meat or a meat product.

21,"Jun 21, 2018",CNBC,House narrowly approves farm bill that could cut food stamps to millions of low-income Americans,"The House narrowly approved an $867 billion farm bill with controversial provisions that could stop millions from receiving food stamps and toughen work requirements for program participants.

The House's 213-211 vote means the legislation will go to conference with the Senate version of the bill. This marked the second attempt by the House to pass the farm bill after it failed to approve the legislation last month, due to an immigration squabble among Republicans.

There are nutritional program cuts in the House farm bill that could face problems in conference with the Senate version. The Senate Agriculture Committee's farm bill passed out of the panel June 13 and didn't include major changes in food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

""This bill does nothing to actually strengthen agriculture programs or help farmers caught in the president's trade war,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass, in a release. ""I hope the bipartisan process in the Senate leads to a better bill that strengthens our farm safety net and anti-hunger programs so this attack on our most vulnerable never reaches the president's desk.""

But the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture hailed at passage of the 2018 farm bill.

""Today's vote was about keeping faith with the men and women of rural America and about the enduring promise of the dignity of a day's work,"" Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, said in a statement. ""It was about providing certainty to farmers and ranchers who have been struggling under the weight of a five-year recession and about providing our neighbors in need with more than just a hand out, but a hand up.""

The House farm bill includes cuts of more than $20 billion in SNAP benefits over 10 years. The legislation also contains provisions that could see more than 2 million low-income Americans lose their benefits or experience declines in financial assistance. Critics of the legislation also contend the legislation could result in nearly 265,000 children losing access to free school meals.

Total benefits paid out last year by SNAP exceeded $63 billion, and went to more than 42 million participants.

The House's farm bill — formally known as the so-called Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 — includes new work requirements for SNAP participants that tighten existing rules. The White House also has been pushing for tougher work requirements for public assistance programs that target low-income Americans, including food stamps and public housing assistance.

""They're trying to find ways to cut back on people who have access to SNAP, and frankly they're trying to do it by putting in new work requirements"" said Steve Taylor, senior vice president and counsel for public policy with United Way Worldwide, a global nonprofit based in Virginia. ""United Way agrees in the value and dignity of work. We want people to be able to be able to work and pull themselves out of even needing services and needing things like food stamps.""

Taylor said there was United Way staff from all around the country on Capitol Hill on Thursday ahead of the farm bill vote in the House.

""What we found was there were a lot of congressional offices voting on this bill that didn't know that SNAP already has work requirements,"" he said. ""So I think there may be some misunderstanding about exactly what the requirements are in SNAP, which is unfortunate when you're vote on a bill that is just creating obstacles for needy people.""

However, some Republican members of Congress applauded the SNAP changes in the bill.

""I am especially supportive of the reforms made to SNAP, which require able-bodied individuals aged 18-59 to participate in employment training or work a minimum of 20 hours a week,"" said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., in a statement. ""By refocusing reforms on work requirement, those who depend on SNAP, like the elderly and disabled, still have access to the support they need, but significant steps are taken to ensure that Americans are entering the workforce and no longer dependent on federal government assistance.""

The farm bill also contains changes that have angered environmentalists who claim the new rules would undermine clean water rules and exempt pesticide pollution.

The farm bill covers everything from farm subsidies and food stamps to trade and rural development policy. Farmer assistance includes commodity payment programs, as well as subsidized crop insurance. The bill is usually renewed every five years, and the current version is set to expire Sept. 30.

""Passage of a long-term Farm Bill allows farmers and ranchers to plan ahead and make decisions to improve their business,"" said Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., in a release. He represents a congressional district in California's Central Valley, a region known for its extensive agriculture production.



""Passage of the House farm bill today is a big win for America's farmers and ranchers,"" American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. ""Our grassroots Farm Bureau members clearly made their voices heard. By approving the 2018 Farm Bill today, members of the House recognized the serious economic challenges facing farmers and ranchers across the country.""

Duvall said the farm organization will now turn its attention to the Senate version of the farm bill and work with Senate Agriculture Committee leaders. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated he wants to get the farm bill through the upper chamber before the July Fourth recess.

""The Senate bill also addresses the challenges our farmers and ranchers are facing today,"" said Duvall. ""We will also continue to focus our attention on other areas important to farmers, such as finding a solution for the very serious ag labor shortage, increasing market opportunities through trade and cutting the burdens of regulations that have piled up during previous administrations.""

The Sierra Club issued a press release after the farm bill's passage slamming what it called ""a package that weakens the SNAP anti-hunger program and includes provisions undermining bedrock environmental safeguards for clean water, wildfire and forests.""

Specifically, environmentalists say farm bill includes rollbacks on the Clean Water Act requirements as it relates to pesticides by easing rules on permits. They also called out provisions in the legislation that would speed up logging and mining in forests.","The House narrowly approved an $867 billion farm bill with controversial provisions that could stop millions from receiving food stamps and toughen work requirements for program participants.

22,"Jul 9, 2019",ProCon.org,Mississippi Bans Meat-Related Names for Vegetarian Product Labels,"Source: miikkahoo, “Veggie Burger with Zucchini/Feta/Pea Patty,” wikimedia.org, June 13, 2018 A new law in Mississippi (SB 2922) bans the use of certain descriptive words traditionally associated with meat products on labels for vegetarian and vegan plant-based products. As of July 1, 2019, words such as “burger” and “hot dog” can only be used if the product is made of animal meat. That means the name “veggie burger” is no longer permitted on labels for plant-based patties. The ban also applies to food made from insects and meats made in a lab from cultured animal cells (as opposed to slaughtered livestock). Andy Berry, Mississippi Cattlemen’s Association Executive Vice President, stated last year, “We’re concerned about how those products are labeled… People have a choice, and we don’t want them to be mislead or maybe even tricked into buying something that is ‘meat’ that has no meat in it.” The new law is meant to protect consumers from confusion and manufacturers from unfair competition with plant-based products, according to proponents. The ban is being challenged in court by the Institute for Justice and the Plant Based Foods Association, among other groups. Missouri passed a similar law in 2018, which is also being challenged in court as a First Amendment violation by groups including the Good Food Institute and the ACLU. Jessica Almy, Director of Policy at the Good Food Institute, said, “There is no evidence that consumers are confused by plant-based bacon or veggie burger labels, and federal laws are already in place that prohibits consumer deception. This law is a tremendous overstep of state powers.” Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson defended the law, saying, “It’s not a free speech violation to require the truth in consumer products. And to claim that something is meat that isn’t meat is not true.” A US District Court in California previously ruled that consumers were not being tricked into mistaking plant-based products for animal-based products in a 2013 case regarding the use of the word “milk.” The ruling stated, “The crux of the claims is that a reasonable consumer might confuse plant-based beverages such as soymilk or almond milk for dairy milk, because of the use of the word ‘milk.’ The Court finds such confusion highly improbable because of the use of the words ‘soy’ and ‘almond.’ Plaintiffs essentially allege that a reasonable consumer would view the terms ‘soymilk’ and ‘almond milk,’ disregard the first words in the names, and assume that the beverages came from cows. The claim stretches the bounds of credulity.” Vegan and vegetarian products have come under labeling scrutiny in other places as well. In Canada, Blue Heron Creamery can no longer use the word “cheese” for their plant-based dairy-free products as of Feb. 2019. Words like Cheddar and chèvre are also prohibited. A German court ruled similarly against cheese-substitute manufacturer TofuTown in 2016. In the European Union, “veggie burgers” may soon be called “veggie discs” following the European parliament’s agriculture committee approval of a ban on using meat-related terminology on vegetarian food. Sales of plant-based “meats” increased 42% from 2016 to 2019; the market for these products is worth an estimated $12.1 billion in 2019 and could reach $27.9 billion by 2025. Beyond Meat, a plant-based food manufacturer, almost doubled its net revenue from $32.6 million in 2017 to $87.9 million in 2018. Fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Del Taco now offer plant-based “fake meat” substitutes in some locations.","Source: miikkahoo, “Veggie Burger with Zucchini/Feta/Pea Patty,” wikimedia.org, June 13, 2018 A new law in Mississippi (SB 2922) bans the use of certain descriptive words traditionally associated with meat products on labels for vegetarian and vegan plant-based products.

The deadly pandemic that tore through the nation’s heartland struck just as Aaron Crawford was in a moment of crisis. He was looking for work, his wife needed surgery, then the virus began eating away at her work hours and her paycheck.

The Crawfords had no savings, mounting bills and a growing dread: What if they ran out of food? The couple had two boys, 5 and 10, and boxes of macaroni and cheese from the dollar store could go only so far.

A 37-year-old Navy vet, Crawford saw himself as self-reliant. Asking for food made him uncomfortable. “I felt like I was a failure,” he says. “It’s this whole stigma ... this mindset that you’re this guy who can’t provide for his family, that you’re a deadbeat.”

Hunger is a harsh reality in the richest country in the world. Even during times of prosperity, schools hand out millions of hot meals a day to children, and desperate elderly Americans are sometimes forced to choose between medicine and food.

Now, in the pandemic of 2020, with illness, job loss and business closures, millions more Americans are worried about empty refrigerators and barren cupboards. Food banks are doling out meals at a rapid pace and an Associated Press data analysis found a sharp rise in the amount of food distributed compared with last year. Meanwhile, some folks are skipping meals so their children can eat and others are depending on cheap food that lacks nutrition.

Those fighting hunger say they’ve never seen anything like this in America, even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The first place many Americans are finding relief is a neighborhood food pantry, most connected to vast networks of nonprofits. Tons of food move each day from grocery store discards and government handouts to warehouse distribution centers, and then to the neighborhood charity.

The Crawfords turned to the Family Resource Centers and Food Shelf, part of 360 Communities, a nonprofit 15 minutes from their apartment in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When needed, they receive monthly boxes of fresh produce, dairy, deli, meat and other basics — enough food to fill two grocery carts. If that runs out, they can get an emergency package to tide them over for the rest of the month.

Crawford’s wife, Sheyla, had insisted they seek help; her hours had been cut at the day care center where she worked. At first, Crawford was embarrassed to go the food shelf; he worried he’d bump into someone he knew. He now sees it differently.

“It didn’t make me a bad man or a terrible husband or father,” he says. “On the contrary, I was actually doing something to make sure that my wife and kids had something thing to eat.”

The history books are filled with iconic images of America’s struggles against hunger. Among the most memorable are the Depression-era photos of men standing in breadlines, huddled in long coats and fedoras, their eyes large with fear. An overhead sign reads: “Free Soup. Coffee and a Doughnut for the Unemployed.”

This year’s portrait of hunger has a distinctively bird’s eye view: Enormous traffic jams captured from drone-carrying cameras. Cars inching along, each driver waiting hours for a box or bag of food. From Anaheim, California to San Antonio, Texas to Toledo, Ohio and Orlando, Florida and points in-between, thousands of vehicles carrying hungry people queued up for miles across the horizon. In New York, and other large cities, people stand, waiting for blocks on end.

The newly hungry have similar stories: Their industry collapsed, they lost a job, their hours were cut, an opportunity fell through because of illness.

Handwritten “closed” signs appeared on the windows of stores and restaurants soon after the pandemic arrived. Paychecks shrank or disappeared altogether as unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7 percent, a rate not seen in almost a century.

Food banks felt the pressure almost immediately.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, scrambled to keep up as states locked down and schools — many providing free breakfasts and lunches — closed. In late March, 20 percent of the organization’s 200 food banks were in danger of running out of food.

The problem with supply subsided, but demand has not. Feeding America has never handed out so much food so fast — 4.2 billion meals from March through October. The organization has seen a 60 percent average increase in food bank users during the pandemic: about 4 in 10 are first-timers.

An AP analysis of Feeding America data from 181 food banks in its network found the organization has distributed nearly 57 percent more food in the third quarter of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

There will be no quick decline as the pandemic rages on, having already claimed more than 280,000 lives and infecting 14.7 million people across the nation.

Feeding America estimates those facing hunger will swell to 1 in 6 people, from 35 million in 2019 to more than 50 million by this year’s end. The consequences are even more dire for children — 1 in 4, according to the group.

Some states have been hit especially hard: Nevada, a tourist mecca whose hotel, casino and restaurant industries were battered by the pandemic, is projected to vault from 20th place in 2018 to 5th place this year in food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America.

In four states — Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana — more than 1 in 5 residents are expected to be food insecure by year’s end, meaning they won’t have money or resources to put food on the table, the report said.

In New Orleans one recent Saturday morning, Donna Duerr was waiting to pick up food in a drive-through donation — something that has become part of her routine since COVID-19 swept in last spring.

Her husband was laid off from his job as a pipefitter and she’s unable to work, having undergone two surgeries — one on her spine, the other on her arm — in the last two months. She also has two grown children who’ve moved home since the pandemic began.

“This is a hard thing to accept that you have to do this,” says a weary-sounding Duerr, her throat covered with bandages as the result of a recent operation. Every morning she monitors the local news for announcements of the next food donation; she tries to attend as many as she can, sometimes sharing the food with less-mobile neighbors.

Duerr, 56, faces painful choices. “I either pay bills or get food,” she says, though these donations have brought some relief.

Norman Butler is another first-timer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he and his girlfriend, Cheryl, arrived at 3 a.m. at a drive-through food bank in a suburban New Orleans sports stadium. They joined a pre-dawn procession of mothers with their kids, the elderly and folks like him — unemployed workers.

“You can see the look of uncertainty on their faces,” he says. “Everybody’s just worried about their next meal.”

Before the pandemic, Butler, 53, flourished in the tourism-dominated city, working as an airport shuttle and limousine driver, a valet and hotel doorman. Since March, when the bustling streets turned silent, jobs in the city have been scarce.

“A lot of people are in limbo,” he says. “The main thing we need is to get back to work.”

Low-wage employees, many in the service industry, have borne the brunt of economic hardship. But the misery has reached deeper into the workforce.

A September report commissioned by the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, found 1 in 4 of those reporting they didn’t have enough to eat typically had incomes above $50,000 a year before the outbreak.

In Anchorage, Alaska, Brian and Airis Messick were coasting along in full-time jobs for companies that support the state’s oil industry. They were moving toward buying a house.

When March arrived, everything unraveled.

Brian, 28, the newest hire at an electrical wiring company, was laid off. Within a week, Airis, an office worker at an oil well testing firm, lost her job, too.

Then it became a monthly game of deciding who gets paid first with their unemployment checks — the landlord or one of the many bills. They kept their car filled with gas in case they had to move.

The Messicks and their 9-year-old son, Jayden, tried to survive on $50 to $75 a week because, she says, “that’s all we could squeeze.” They turned to a food bank for only the second time — they’d sought help after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.

After that devastation, the Messicks, who’d met in Florida, decided to get a fresh start and move to Alaska, where Airis had grown up.

Airis, who just turned 30, found work in August, ironically, at the state unemployment office. “I hear people’s stories all day,” she says. “I listen to moms cry about not having money to take care of their kids. My heart aches for the people who get denied.”

Brian stays home with Jayden, who is autistic, helping him with school and driving him to appointments. Also part of the family are Cleo, a pit bull-lab mix, and Daisy, a bearded dragon.

Airis earns too much for the family to receive state financial aid. Anchorage’s high cost-of-living, partly fueled by the expense of shipping goods to the nation’s most northern state, makes it harder to economize even with coupons and careful shopping.

She says the family will continue to go to the food bank until the economy improves, which she expects won’t be soon.

There should be better systems in place, she says, to help families.

“I feel great knowing that we’re not alone, that we’re, you know, not out here being the only one suffering but,” she says, “it makes me mad to know my government failed us.”

For communities of color, the pandemic has been a compound disaster with Blacks and Latinos reeling from disproportionately high rates of deaths, infections — and joblessness.

Unemployment surged among Latinos to 18.9 percent this spring, higher than any other racial and ethnic group, according to federal statistics. Though it has since fallen, many are still struggling.

More than 1 in 5 Black and Latino adults with children said as of July 2020 they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat, according to the commissioned report. That was double the rate of white and Asian households. It also found that women, households with children and people of color are at greatest risk of hunger.

Abigail Leocadio, 34, first approached the nonprofit Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, Arizona, during hard times about a decade ago. Her family rebounded and she completed training to become a phlebotomist, landing a job drawing blood specimens for a local lab.

Leocadio was just 7 when her family brought her to the U.S. from their native Cuernavaca, Mexico. She currently is protected from deportation and has a work permit through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

When her husband, a restaurant cook, was laid off earlier in the pandemic, her income — barely more than the $11 state minimum wage — wasn’t enough to cover their expenses.

Though they own a two-bedroom trailer, they pay $500 a month to rent the lot. Add to that as much as $450 in monthly electric bills and internet service so their four kids, 9 to 15, can attend class remotely. Before schools closed, the kids received free breakfasts and lunches on campus.

“It has been hard feeding all the kiddos daily,” Leocadio said outside the trailer after a recent delivery from the charity of two boxes including canned tomatoes, dried beans, rice, breakfast cereal and the kids’ undisputed favorite: specialty Oreo cookies.

The food, she says, provides less than half of what her family eats in four weeks, but significantly reduces their monthly bill to about $250. Before the pandemic, the family was saving to buy a house, but that money has been wiped out. Her husband, though, is back at work.

“We always figure out things one way or another,” Leocadio says, though she’s worried about the surge in coronavirus cases and what lies ahead. “We really don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Briana Dominguez had been depending on food pantries in the Chicago area since last fall to supplement her groceries. With two sons, ages 3 and 14, it was hard to keep up, even though she and her boyfriend both worked full-time.

“I never thought it would be me,” she says of her visits to the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois. “But you do what you gotta do to survive.”

A series of misfortunes brought them to a turning point.

Dominguez had a miscarriage, and her father lost his job, due to the pandemic. So did her boyfriend, a trucker. In November her company, which sells ceiling tiles for hospitals and other business, eliminated her job with little notice.

Dominguez, 34, who has a small severance, has decided to move to Georgia, where she has family and living costs are lower. Her boyfriend has found work as a customer service representative that he can do from anywhere, though it’s only $13 an hour. She traveled there in early December to scout job possibilities.

“If I don’t do it now,” she says, “I’ll never do it.”

While food banks have become critical during the pandemic, they’re just one path for combating hunger. For every meal from a food bank, a federal program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, provides nine.

Anti-hunger groups have lobbied Congress for a 15 percent increase in maximum food stamp benefits, A similar measure went a long way in digging the nation out of the Great Recession. A stimulus bill passed by the House this spring includes such a provision, but it has been bogged down in partisan squabbling.

“Food banks and food pantries are doing great work,” says Luis Guardia, president of thee Food Research & Action Center. “But they simply cannot do enough to be something of the order of magnitude that we’re seeing right now. ”

Many going to food pantries also are receiving food stamps, though eligibility varies among states.

Aaron Crawford says the addition of $550 in food stamps the family started receiving last summer has made a significant difference in their lives.

Others have discovered they couldn’t make it without food help, even with Social Security or other benefits.

(AP Video/Martha Irvine)

Phyllis Marder, 66, had both Social Security and unemployment when she arrived at the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois, where she’s lived in the same bungalow for 20 years.

She’d been supplementing her benefits as an Uber drive, and when the pandemic hit, she helped workers bring home their computers and office gear. After that, she ferried medical and other front-line workers, but that came to an abrupt end with a COVID-19 scare.

At first, Marder, didn’t tell anyone about visiting food pantries. Then she had a change of heart. “Keeping a secret makes things get worse,” she says, “… and makes me feel worse about myself, and so I decided that it was more important to talk about it.”

Marder sometimes shared her food with neighbors and a panhandler on a freeway ramp. But she expects her food bank visits will end soon.

In a few days, she starts a job — courtesy of the pandemic.

She’ll be a coronavirus contract tracer, working remotely for a nearby county.

___

As the year nears its end, Crawford is more confident.

The months have been filled with setbacks and successes. Both Crawfords developed mild cases of COVID-19. Sheyla had hysterectomy surgery and was out work without pay for six weeks.

But they’ve rebounded, too.

Crawford has two part-time jobs, one at United Parcel Service, the second as a maintenance worker at a home for the elderly. His wife is back at work at the day care center. And their boys are receiving breakfast and lunch at their school that provides day care.

The financial troubles that brought them to the food bank haven’t disappeared. They still have overdue bills and a car that needs repairs.

But after many dark months, there have been moments of relief. This fall when the couple contracted COVID-19, their sons’ school sent meals and milk to help,

And a friend had an 18-pound turkey delivered for a Thanksgiving feast. It was so big the Crawfords had to figure out how to find room for the leftovers in the refrigerator now stocked with food.

A full fridge, Crawford says, is a welcome sight.

“It just kind of puts you at ease,” he says. “There’s a sense of peace.”

She said it was difficult to prosecute companies for hiring undocumented workers, as significant evidence would be needed to prove complicity.

Prosecutions are not common, said Kimberley Best Robidoux, a business immigration lawyer in San Diego who specializes in compliance. According to data compiled by Syracuse University and released in May, only 11 people were prosecuted from April 2018 through March 2019 for employing immigrants who did not have proper documentation. No companies were prosecuted during that time, according to the data.

The raids on Aug. 7 were the largest to occur since President Trump, who has made illegal immigration a focal point of his presidency, took office.

According to the affidavits, the Peco Foods plants targeted in the raids are in Bay Springs, Canton and Walnut Grove; The Koch Foods plant is in Morton, as is the P H Food Inc. plant; The Pearl River Foods plant is in Carthage; and the A&B Inc. plant is in Pelahatchie.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi, which conducted the searches with ICE, said that some of the people who were rounded up were taken to an ICE detention center in Jena, La. Others have been released on “humanitarian” grounds, but they are required to appear before a federal immigration judge who will determine whether or not they will be deported.

25,"May 4, 2018",Mississippi Today,Mississippi still the hungriest state,"For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

“We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.

27,"Mar 12, 2020",Civil Eats,Congress Addresses Food Insecurity in Its Legislative Response to COVID-19,"Editor’s note: This is a developing story; Civil Eats will update as the news evolves.

March 27, 2020 update: The U.S. House of Representative overwhelmingly passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus recovery and stimulus bill today, sending it to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it.

March 26, 2020 update: The Senate’s stimulus bill includes nearly $16 billion for SNAP, but not the additional 15 percent boost that Democrats were seeking. Also included in the bill is a $9.5 billion emergency fund for producers of specialty crops and support for local food systems, including farmers’ markets. In addition, the bill directs $285 million to USDA agencies to support emergency operations during the pandemic.

March 25, 2020 update: The Senate and White House early on Wednesday reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion spending bill aimed at supporting businesses, workers, and individuals during the pandemic. The bill text is not yet public, but once it is made public, the House of Representatives will review and vote on the bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats earlier this week offered their own version of a stimulus / support package.

March 18, 2020 update: The Senate on Wednesday afternoon voted 90-8 to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, aimed at providing some support and benefits to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

March 16, 2020 update: Early on Saturday, March 14, the House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with strong bipartisan support, and with many of the provisions described in the original article below included.

The final text includes language that gives USDA the ability to waive various requirements that are preventing districts from feeding hungry children while schools are shuttered. As of March 15, at least 64,000 schools have closed, affecting more than 32.5 million students.

On SNAP, the final bill prevents eligibility restrictions during a public health emergency and gives states some flexibility to ask for emergency allotments, but does not directly increase benefits. It also provides an additional $500 million in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and an additional $250 million for food programs for low-income seniors, through September 2021.

The Senate is expected to take up the bill today. While some Republicans and President Trump have signaled support, its fate is still uncertain.

March 13, 2020, 3pm ET update:In a press conference at 2:00pm ET, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be “passing a bill” today. “Our bill takes aggressive action to strengthen food security initiatives including student meals as well as SNAP, senior meals, and food banks,” she said. However, Civil Eats has yet to see a final version of the legislative package, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. So it remains unclear which of the provisions on school meals and SNAP benefits (described below, as provisions of separate marker bills) will make it into the final legislation.

March 13, 2020, 11am ET update: As of early Friday, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate the package of legislation; a vote in the House of Representatives is expected today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned for the weekend on Thursday, but canceled the Senate’s scheduled recess next week, so a vote on the legislative package could happen next week if the House passes the bill.

At least 10,600 schools have closed across the U.S., affecting at least 4.9 million students. Five states have closed their schools entirely: Ohio, Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and Washington.

28,"Apr 9, 2020",The New York Times,‘Never Seen Anything Like It’: Cars Line Up for Miles at Food Banks,"Based in Las Vegas, Three Square Food Bank previously distributed food through 180 pantries across Clark County. Since the outbreak — and the sudden closing of nearly all of the city’s gambling and tourism attractions — the organization has restructured, with 10 pantries and 21 new drive-through distribution sites.

Larry Scott, Three Square’s chief operating officer, said that the group had expected 200 to 250 cars a day at each drive-through. They’re getting up to 500 to 600 cars instead, with lines up to four miles long. “Every day, we distribute everything that we bring to a site,” Mr. Scott said.

An initial glut of high-quality food from shuttered casinos is basically gone, Mr. Scott said. Now his food bank is burning through an extra $300,000 to $400,000 a week in cash to buy food.

He said that he saw no relief in sight. “What we do today has to be repeated again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day,” Mr. Scott said. “Hungry people are hungry each and every day.”

Ericka Smrcka, an official at Food Bank for the Heartland in Nebraska, went to a recent mobile food distribution at a middle school in neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. She and a colleague arrived nearly an hour before it was scheduled to start to find the streets jammed in every direction and the police directing traffic.

“We were overwhelmed with tears,” Ms. Smrcka said. “Oh, my gosh. Everywhere we looked, there were just cars.”

The delivery truck had enough boxes of food — produce, bread and milk — for 200 vehicles. Some 400 showed up. Ms. Smrcka recalled feeling apprehensive at the prospect of walking car to car with nothing more than a flier describing alternative resources, thinking she might get yelled at.

But that’s not what happened. “After sitting in their car for an hour and not receiving any food, they still said thank you,” she said, recalling in particular a father who had left work early and picked up his three daughters, and who departed empty-handed.","Based in Las Vegas, Three Square Food Bank previously distributed food through 180 pantries across Clark County.

29,"Jan 26, 2021",Civil Eats,The Pandemic Reveals Racial Gaps in School Meal Access,"As an attorney working on school desegregation cases in the South, GeDá Jones Herbert is intimately familiar with inequities and discrimination that Black families face on a regular basis. And when schools began shutting down in-person instruction last March due to the pandemic, she heard from many of her clients.

“We knew that [the pandemic] was going to have a huge impact on the lives of our clients and students across the country,” said Herbert, who is based in New Orleans and works primarily on cases in Louisiana and Alabama. “As we were assessing the closures, the things we were really looking at were access to distance learning . . . and food and nutrition.”

Her team at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) zeroed in specifically on the connection between meal access and race. The education lawyers knew many students from low-income families depended on school meals for adequate nutrition. In 2019, more than 29 million children ate free and reduced-price school lunches daily. In the communities LDF was working in, they also knew that a disproportionate number of those students were Black.

Once COVID-19 began its spread early last year, school nutrition departments across the country began scrambling to continue serving meals in various ways. After waivers from the federal government allowed them to make changes like packaging meals to go, some districts set up pick-up sites, and others used bus drivers to deliver meals. But many districts began going broke in the process, and others faced COVID outbreaks. In response, some districts limited pick-up site operation to just a few hours a week, and others stopped serving meals altogether.

Herbert and her team argued that several districts that ceased meal service were violating civil rights laws, because such a high proportion of students eating the subsidized meals were Black. Even in places where meals were offered, limitations like site location and pick-up times prevented many Black families from accessing them.

LDF sent letters to the governors of Louisiana and Alabama detailing their legal arguments and sharing what they were hearing from clients. “A child without access to transportation by car in the Four Corners neighborhood in St. Mary Parish [southwest of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico] would have had to walk four hours each way to get to the nearest ‘Grab n Go’ site, each of which was open for a mere hour and a half,” one letter read. “Even after the district eventually added a Baldwin site, children in the Four Corners neighborhood still would have had to walk two hours each way to pick up their breakfast and lunch.”

“A child without access to transportation by car in the Four Corners neighborhood in St. Mary Parish would have had to walk four hours each way to get to the nearest ‘Grab n Go’ site, each of which was open for a mere hour and a half.”

In Leeds, Alabama, schools stopped providing meals entirely on April 2. LDF sued the district there, forcing it to restart meal service. LDF’s efforts caught the attention of researchers at Columbia, Harvard, and the University of North Carolina. They began working on several projects that looked at whether access to school meals during the pandemic was affected by race.

The situation gained the attention of several members of Congress as well. In June, Representative Bobby Scott (D-Virginia), chairman of the Committee On Education and Labor, sent a letter to former Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “I am concerned that during this pandemic, many Black and other children of color are left hungry due to inadequate access to school meals,” he wrote, noting a dire statistic: During March and April, the rate of food insecurity for Black households was double that of white households.

Since then, districts across the country—including those LDF is monitoring—have gotten better at streamlining pandemic meal services, giving more students access to food. And schools are back in session in some areas. But racial discrepancies still exist.

In December, the Urban Institute reported 40 percent of Black families with school-age children were food insecure in September, compared to 15 percent of white families. Meanwhile, nearly two thirds of all families reported that their children were not receiving meals from schools. “These data suggest that a significant portion of vulnerable children may not be benefiting from school-based nutrition resources amid the shifting mix of virtual and hybrid instruction,” the report noted.

And while school meal access may not be as stark an issue as it was just months ago, Herbert and other experts say questions of how to guarantee equitable access to school meals—and whether the current system does enough to consider race—are more pressing than ever.

“Just because a system has been put in place and people are maintaining it for now doesn’t mean that the problem is solved,” she said. “This is going to continue to be an issue, so we really have to develop some longer-term solutions.”

Mapping Meal Sites

When schools shut down, researchers around the country who focus on school meal programs began sharing resources and chatting online about what they were seeing. Julia McCarthy is the interim deputy director of the Laurie M. Tisch Center for Food, Education & Policy at Columbia University. She formed a research team with Caroline Glagola Dunn at Harvard and Jared McGuirt at the University of North Carolina Greensboro to begin studying school meal access across the country.

When she saw LDF’s letter to the governor of Louisiana, McCarthy was shocked. To help document evidence of possible disparities in southern Louisiana districts, McCarthy, Dunn, and McGuirt used U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and district data to visually depict where meal pick-up sites were located in relation to the percentage of the neighborhood population that was Black.

“In the westernmost part of St. Mary Parish, the census block tract there is 72 to 88 percent Black. There wasn’t a single meal distribution site there.”

Based on those maps, “It was pretty consistent across the board that sites were more conveniently located for white families,” Herbert said. She anticipated that the problem would be exacerbated by the fact that based on the most recent data, 17 percent of Black residents in Louisiana don’t have access to a car, compared to 5 percent of white residents.

“In the westernmost part of St. Mary Parish, the census block tract there is 72 to 88 percent Black. There wasn’t a single meal distribution site there,” McCarthy said.

St. John Parish, about 30 miles northwest of New Orleans, is an area known for a history of environmental racism, with Black communities bearing the brunt of toxic air pollution from chemical plants and oil refineries. The parish has the highest risk of cancer due to air pollution in the entire country.","and food and nutrition.”Her team at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) zeroed in specifically on the connection between meal access and race.

31,"Nov 23, 2020",,"Survey: Food Insecurity, Lack of Support Remain Top Challenges for Mississippians Receiving SNAP","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic. A new state survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients finds that Mississippi families need help with food, housing and utilities, especially since government assistance for many families expired earlier this year.

The survey was released by the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP). It found that 66 percent of those surveyed were having trouble buying enough food at some point during the pandemic. Child care issues were cited by 32 percent and the loss of jobs were also cited by 29 percent.

“Food security was a challenge for many Mississippians well before the pandemic, whether it was people struggling to make ends meet in low wage work or who lacked access to fresh food where they lived,” said Sara Miller, policy analyst at the Hope Policy Institute. “As the pandemic brings these issues to a crisis point, families and communities need both near-term recovery efforts and improvements to food systems in our state overall.”

Government assistance has made a real difference, with 51 percent of respondents saying programs or assistance helped. But most of that aid has expired. Organizations like the SPLC Action Fund, Hope Policy Institute, Children’s Defense Fund, Hope Delta and Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Mississippi, Mississippi Center for Justice and the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative are calling for the state and federal government to take these concerns into account and move immediately to provide more assistance.

“What this survey shows is that people need help,” said Brandon Jones, Mississippi policy director for the SPLC Action Fund. “We need the government, both at the state and federal level, to do more to help the people who are suffering because of the pandemic.”

Of the 12 Southern states surveyed, Mississippi was the only state to have SNAP and P-EBT application issues as the greatest challenges. All other Southern states had problems with unemployment insurance or stimulus checks as the top challenge. The share of Mississippi respondents who had problems applying for or receiving SNAP was 10 percentage points higher than the share for all Southern respondents (23% vs. 13%).

“The pandemic has exacerbated poverty in Mississippi and the need for holistic systems of support is urgent,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative. “Mississippians need access to food, child care, housing and employment assistance to rebuild their economic security. Mississippians who received pandemic unemployment benefits were priced out of SNAP and consequently lost food assistance, a glaring example of our fractured safety net.”

The data came from 297 anonymized surveys in Mississippi in August and September. Respondents were invited to answer a mixture of multiple choice and open-ended questions about challenges and changes in the wake of the pandemic, experiences using and applying for government benefits, and recommendations and requests for policymakers.","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic.

32,"Sep 10, 2019",The National Law Review,Mississippi Reverses Stance on Plant-Based Meat Labeling,"Tuesday, September 10, 2019

As previously reported on this blog, Upton’s Naturals Co. and the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA) filed a lawsuit challenging Mississippi’s law prohibiting cell-based, plant-based, or insect-based foods from being labeled as “meat” or a “meat food product” (i.e., “hamburgers,” “hotdogs,” etc.). The lawsuit was filed on July 1, 2019, the same day that the law took effect. The plaintiffs claimed that the Mississippi law violated their First Amendment right to free speech, among other things. The Institute for Justice (IJ) later joined the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Last week, the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce proposed new regulations to implement the law that would allow the use of meat and meat product terms on the labels of plant-based food if certain conditions are met. More specifically, the proposed regulations specify that a plant-based food product will not be considered to be labeled as a “meat” or “meat food product” if one or more of the following terms, or a comparable qualifier, is prominently displayed on the front of the package: “meat free,” “meatless,” “plant-based,” “veggie-based,” “made from plants,” “vegetarian,” or “vegan.”

After the proposed regulations were revised, Ag Commissioner Andy Gipson issued a statement on September 6, stated that the law “is constitutional and has not changed.” He added, “Our proposed rules support the law and make it clear these products cannot be false or misleading and cannot be labeled as meat or as a meat food product, but must use the qualifiers set out in the regulations.” He also claimed that there “was no need for a federal lawsuit.”

Expressing an opposing view, IJ issued a press release stating that the recently proposed regulatory changes were in response to the lawsuit. “Our lawsuit made it clear that subjecting plant-based food companies to possible criminal prosecution for using common terms on their labels would be a violation of their free speech rights,” said IJ Senior Attorney Justin Pearson.

Upton’s Natural and PBFA will consider dropping their federal lawsuit if the proposed regulations are adopted after the 25-day public comment period, according to the press release. We will continue to monitor and report on legal and regulatory activity in this area.","Tuesday, September 10, 2019As previously reported on this blog, Upton’s Naturals Co. and the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA) filed a lawsuit challenging Mississippi’s law prohibiting cell-based, plant-based, or insect-based foods from being labeled as “meat” or a “meat food product” (i.e., “hamburgers,” “hotdogs,” etc.).

Eventually, the state legislature came around to the idea that making it illegal to use ""meaty"" terms on plant-based foods wasn't the greatest idea.

""This is a total victory,"" Justin Pearson, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice (IJ) and the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in the announcement. ""Our clients simply wanted to continue using clear labels with the terms consumers understand best. In response to our lawsuit, the Mississippi Department of Agriculture has done the right thing, so there is no need to move forward with the lawsuit."" As IJ points out, Mississippi already had laws against misleading labels, so Mississippi's new rules—which had taken effect one July 1—specifically discriminated against plant-based meat, allegedly at the behest of the Mississippi Cattlemen's Association.

""We are thrilled with this common-sense outcome of our lawsuit,"" added Michele Simon, the PBFA's executive director. ""We hope that other states considering similar legislation will follow Mississippi's lead in allowing clear qualifying terms that our members are already using to communicate to consumers."" Recently, we've seen similar fights and lawsuits in states like Arkansas and Missouri.

But it turns out the next fight could happen on a federal level: Last week, Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, proposed a piece of bipartisan legislation—the Real Marketing Edible Artificials Truthfully (MEAT) Act—which states that ""any imitation meat food product, beef, or beef product shall be deemed to be misbranded unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word 'imitation' immediately before or after the name of the food and a statement that clearly indicates the product is not derived from or does not contain meat.""","Probably not often, but that was one of the concerns behind an initiative in Mississippi (and similar moves in other states) to bar plant-based meat companies from using butcher-like terms to label their products.

34,"Mar 23, 2018",,Mississippi high school students participate in World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute,"Contact: Vanessa Beeson

STARKVILLE, Miss. —More than a dozen high school students participated in the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute on Friday [March 23] at Mississippi State University.

Hosted by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, students from across Mississippi spent the day engaged in conversation about global food security with their peers, teachers, MSU faculty and administrators and various food security experts.

Attendees were officially designated Borlaug Scholars for their participation and are eligible for scholarships to Mississippi State University. The Borlaug Scholars pay tribute to the World Food Prize’s founder Norman E. Borlaug. To become a Borlaug Scholar, each student wrote a research paper about a developing country and a food security topic. Each project included innovative ways to improve global food security. The students presented their findings at the on-campus event.

“The Mississippi Youth Institute is a partnership program with the World Food Prize. It challenges high school students to explore the world’s most pressing issues related to food security,” said Libby Crimmings, the World Food Prize’s national education program director. “The World Food Prize’s founder, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was passionate about working with students. He believed if you want people solving these challenges when they are 60 years old, they have to be thinking about it when they are 16 years old.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a global food security champion, welcomed the students in an opening session.

“By 2050, the world population will surpass 10 billion. That means we will need to feed an additional 3 billion people at our global dinner table by the time this class of Borlaug Scholars reaches their 40s,” Keenum said. “That’s why we need young talented students like this who take an interest in the future of the world to try and make a difference, serve humanity and address these critical challenges.”

“It’s also why Mississippi State, as a leading land-grant research institution trained on improving food security on a global scale, is tackling many of these problems today. We are trying to address these challenges through science and research to figure out how we can advance productivity so we can feed the world.” Keenum added.

Scott Willard, associate dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, along with support from the entire MSU Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine administration, has been instrumental in seeing this institute come to fruition.

“Our college is thrilled to host the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute. Achieving global food security is essential as it becomes evident that we must feed more people with fewer resources,” Willard said. “This program provides a platform for high school students to formulate novel solutions to help solve one of the most pressing needs of their generation.”

Students also attended the college’s Charles E. Lindley Lecture. Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, presented on hunger in the Magnolia State. His presentation, “Mississippi: The Hungriest State in the Nation” explained how MFN is addressing food insecurity.

Top students from World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute will be invited to the Global Youth Institute in Iowa in October. Participating students also are eligible to apply to the Borlaug Ruan International Internship and the USDA Wallace-Carver Fellowship.

36,5 days ago,GazetteNET,Food & Farm: A ‘HIP’ way to bolster food security,"A few weeks ago, I went with my friend, Kathleen Chapman — or KC, as she’s called — to the February Winter Farmers’ Market at the Northampton Senior Center.

KC is a Southerner, a smart, funny artist and teacher who moved to Northampton from Mississippi in 2019. Shopping with her is always a good reminder of how blessed western Massachusetts is with relative abundance. Mississippi is a state that consistently ranks as the most food insecure in the nation, with a good many of its residents living miles from the nearest grocery store.

KC always remarks on the plenty of the Pioneer Valley, joking sometimes that someone needs to set up a swap between this area and the South, in which the South will ship dogs to Northampton in exchange for food.

The catch, however, is that food, along with everything else, is so much more expensive here than in Mississippi. KC, who lives in senior housing downtown, uses a combination of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — what people used to know as food stamps) and Survival Center groceries to help her stretch her fixed budget. At the Farmers’ Market, she also has access to an additional tool in the form of HIP benefits.

HIP is the Healthy Incentives Program, a state- and USDA-funded program that provides monthly incentives to SNAP households when they purchase fresh local vegetables and fruit at farmers markets, mobile markets, farm shares and farm stands. HIP automatically adds back any SNAP money spent at one of the above outlets, up to a certain amount. So, for instance, the SNAP money KC spends on local produce at the Winter Market is immediately added back to her Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, and, as a household of one, she can spend up to $40 a month on local produce via HIP.

It’s not hard to see how this might benefit the health and well-being of households with limited means. Nutrition research can be fickle and biased, but to my knowledge, there is no study that argues that increasing your daily intake of vegetables will do anything but improve your health outcomes.

And people have been using HIP. Since the program began in 2017, SNAP sales at farm retail outlets increased by a whopping 1,250%; to date, 88,000 families have used their HIP incentives, 45% of whom include seniors, and 30% of whom include children.

The program has been popular enough that the state has periodically had to halt its disbursement of HIP funding because it underestimated the demand for fresh, local produce among its low-income citizens. And besides produce, HIP can also be used to purchase edible plants, so that people who have a bit of growing room can spend their HIP allowance on veggie and herb plant starts, thus increasing their access to fresh produce for an entire season.

If these were the only benefits that accrued to the community via HIP, the program would already be an asset, but its value extends beyond the customers. HIP does a good amount of legwork in the effort to create a more sustainable food system by supporting local farmers as well.

For growers, the cost of organically raising, picking, washing, packaging and distributing produce while stewarding land in a holistic, sustainable way while paying themselves and their workers a living wage is undeniably high.

According to Olivia Pettingill of Wingate Farm, the HIP program has permitted farmers like her to cover their costs while feeding a more economically diverse range of people.

“HIP has significantly enabled a more equal distribution of high-quality produce to our local community,” she says, “and it’s done this while allowing small farmers to stay in business and even thrive.”

She points out that HIP has more lasting effects as well on the kind of general thinking and public curiosity that lead to greater food security. Local farmers try to grow produce and fruits that do well in our local climate, but that doesn’t always mean growing the vegetables that are the most conventionally recognized.

HIP incentivizes people to try different kinds of veggies that are more locally sustainable, and in doing so, it builds a marketplace that relies less on foods from far-flung places, thus reducing the carbon footprint of shipping.

SNAP Match

The program is not without its issues. As mentioned, there have been periods when it shut down for lack of funding, which is confusing and frustrating for those attempting to use their benefits. This inconsistency also limits farmers’ ability to plan, as well as HIP’s ability to make a sustained difference in people’s eating habits.

Also, if you don’t have any SNAP money left on your EBT card, you can’t access your HIP benefits, even though the two amounts are not dependent on each other. And a further issue is that the benefits are pretty specific: You can buy local vegetables and fruit, but other farm products such as eggs or meat aren’t covered.

In an effort to fill that gap, Grow Food Northampton, which operates the Tuesday Farmers’ Market and the current Winter Farmers’ Market, offers SNAP Match, a system in which Grow Food matches the amount of SNAP money an individual spends at the farmers market. (SNAP Match also doubles the match for the first $10 people spend.) In this way, farmers who sell products other than veggies aren’t left out, and people doing their shopping with SNAP benefits are given a wider selection of choices.

It’s rare, I think, to find elegant solutions where food access is concerned, and even rarer when food access, environmental stewardship and the local economy work together in any kind of synergistic fashion, which is why the combination of HIP and SNAP Match — and their potential to help further a smaller, more sustainable, and more equitable food system — is so ingenious.

The majority of SNAP Match is even funded locally, by Valley Home Improvement, which, over the last four years, has doubled the amount of assistance that Grow Food can provide to customers. Steve Silverman, Valley Home Improvement’s founder, says the company is keen on supporting local business and addressing food insecurity as well — values that are complementary and aligned in SNAP Match.

While SNAP Match will continue as long as Grow Food has the money to support it, the proposed state budget for the next fiscal year cuts HIP funding from this year’s $13 million to $5 million in 2022. Given the many benefits to both local farms and families who would otherwise lack access to sustainable fresh local produce, this seems short-sighted from every angle.

Why not keep the momentum going on a program that has demonstrated great potential to positively affect the health of the commonwealth’s most disadvantaged citizens while also allowing local farm businesses to thrive and grow food in a way increases our food security and decreases our carbon footprint?

After the events of the past year, with scary disruptions to the national supply chain due to COVID, it’s in everyone’s interest to take a closer look at the steps we can take to ensure that the bounty that KC remarked upon isn’t jeopardized — and the continued funding of HIP is one of them.

KC, by the way, came away from the Winter Market with beets and onions, eggs, a small amount of bacon for cooking with some dried lima beans, and a jug of maple syrup, which she uses to sweeten her coffee — a nice balance of items good for both body and spirit.

While on occasion the complexity of figuring out the various different systems available to help her access better quality food has been frustrating, she believes absolutely in SNAP Match and HIP as valuable resources that should be funded, and not just for her own sake.

“The vegetables are so expensive at the store that I’m hesitant to buy them,” she told me, “but here [at the Farmer’s Market], I can get these delicious fresh organic vegetables, and it’s helped me a lot. And the fact that the farmers are being supported is the biggest thrill to me.”

39,"Jul 3, 2019",Newsweek,Mississippi Food-Labeling Law Ban Terms Like 'Meatless Meatballs' and 'Vegan Bacon',"A new law in Mississippi bans vegetarian and vegan meat substitutes from using meat-related terms like ""bacon"" and ""meatballs.""

On Monday, the same day the law took effect, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant was sued by Upton's Naturals and the Plant Based Foods Association for violating manufacturers' First Amendment rights.

According to the new regulations, food made from plants—or insects—cannot be labelled as meat or ""a meat food product."" The law also bans food using animal tissue created from laboratory cultures from being labeled meat.

""They tell me that fake steak looks just like our real meat,"" Billy Hudson (R-Hattiesburg), told the AP. ""I don't want to eat meat grown by a test tube in a laboratory. If my constituents do, they ought to know what they're getting.""

Launched in 2006 ""with a focus on meat alternatives and vegan values"" Upton's Naturals offers a variety of vegan products, including seitan burgers and Ch'eesy Bacon Mac (made with wheat gluten). In court filings, the company claims using terms like bacon and burger ""increase consumer understanding of the foods' characteristics and communicate how the foods should be prepared and eaten.""

The Plant Based Foods Association adds that ""no reasonable consumer would be misled"" by the packaging.

But the $49.5 billion beef, poultry, pork and lamb industry isn't taking any chances: ""Our marching orders were to protect beef nomenclature,"" Danielle Beck, director of government affairs for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, told the AP in 2018.

According to GlobalData, 70% of the world population is reducing meat consumption. There's been 600 percent increase in Americans identifying as vegan over the last three years. And sales of plant-based meals shot up 20 percent between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to Nielsen.

The restaurant industry is taking notice: By the end of the year, the plant-based Impossible Whopper will be available at Burger Kings nationwide.

It's millennials who ""are most likely to consider the food source, animal welfare issues, and environmental impacts when making their purchasing decisions,"" says GlobalData consumer analyst Fiona Dyer.

But as consumers are turning to meatless alternatives, meat producers are pushing back: Twelve states have laws similar to Mississippi's—Louisiana's also bars non-rice products from being described as rice and sugar alternatives from being marketed as sugar. Tofurky Co. sued Missouri over its labeling law, though the case was settled out of court this year for an undisclosed amount.

And they're not the only ones with a beef: The dairy industry is balking at using labels like ""milk"" and ""mayonnaise"" in vegetarian and vegan substitutes like soy milk, oat milk and Hampton Creek's egg-free Just Mayo.","A new law in Mississippi bans vegetarian and vegan meat substitutes from using meat-related terms like ""bacon"" and ""meatballs.""

40,"Nov 30, 2020",al.com,Mississippi chicken processing plants to pay back wages after immigration raids,"CLARIFICATION: This story was first published on November 20, 2020. The story and summary were updated on November 30, 2020 to explain that Peco Foods disputes that it broke any laws. It says some workers detained in immigration raids failed to pick up paychecks and the money was later transferred to the Department of Labor so they could find the workers and pay them.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Three Mississippi chicken processing plants among those targeted in one of the largest workplace immigration raids in the U.S. in the past decade have agreed to pay back wages after federal officials found they failed to pay minimum wage and overtime to their workers.

The U.S. Department of Labor announced Nov. 20 that three plants have paid $45,719 in back wages to 129 employees.

The plants targeted in the investigation were a Canton complex owned by Peco Foods of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; a Morton complex owned by Koch Foods of Park Ridge, Illinois; and Pearl River Foods of Carthage, a company headquartered in Gainesville, Georgia.

The Labor Department’s Wage and House Division found the employers failed to issue final paychecks to multiple workers.

Peco denied violating minimum wage laws. It said 15 workers detained in the August 2019 raids failed to retrieve paychecks worth a cumulative $6,215.97. The company said it gave the money to federal officials so they could look for and pay the workers. The Labor Department said failing to pay the workers was a violation.

Officials also found that Pearl River Foods deducted so much money for uniforms that employees were illegally paid less than minimum wage. Investigators also determined Koch failed to include production bonuses when calculating overtime, another legal violation.

The Labor Department assessed a civil fine of $1,693 against Koch for employing a 15-year-old to work in meat processing. Children under 18 aren’t allowed to do that work under federal law.

Officials also raided A&B in Pelahatchie, PH Food in Morton and additional Peco Foods plant in Bay Springs and Sebastapol in the August 2019 raids, which led to the arrests of 680 workers accused of being in the country illegally or using forged documents to gain work.

The raids brought an outcry from critics who said some children had their parents swept up and that workers were unfairly targeted without going after the companies that employ them. In August, on the anniversary of the raids, officials said more than 125 people had been indicted on criminal charges. An unknown number of additional people have been deported in administrative proceedings without facing criminal charges.

Also indicted are four executives from two plants who federal officials said had harbored people in the U.S. illegally and assisted them with obtaining false documents to enable employment or making false statements about hiring workers without proper documents.

Salvador Delgado-Nieves and Iris Villalon worked at A&B, while Carolyn Johnson and Aubrey “Bart” Willis worked for Pearl River Foods. All have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial next year.

Federal officials have said the raids were justified because people in the country illegally steal Social Security numbers to gain work. Mike Hurst, the U.S. Attorney in southern Mississippi, also argued that people in the country illegally take jobs from American citizens and depress their wages.","It says some workers detained in immigration raids failed to pick up paychecks and the money was later transferred to the Department of Labor so they could find the workers and pay them.

42,"May 6, 2019",The Architect's Newspaper,"In Jackson, Mississippi, architects are taking on a citywide hunger problem","By more than one measure, Jackson, Mississippi, is one of the nation’s unhealthiest cities. In 2017, it was named the fattest city in America based on 17 indicators, including obesity rates, levels of physically active adults, and access to fresh produce. In fact, nearly one-fifth of city residents are considered food insecure. The state of Mississippi does not fare much better—for the last eight years, it was reported as the most food insecure state in the country, even though agriculture is the state’s top industry.

It’s not just that Jackson has only 17 grocery stores for a population of nearly 170,000—that’s one per nearly 10,000 people. But the food that is available is disproportionately tipped toward fast food and gas station items. As one scholar of Jackson’s food culture told the Clarion Ledger, “Hunger happens in between bags of chips.”

All of this is compounded by the city’s lack of viable public transit options. Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one. Even those with groceries or farmers’ markets in walking distance are discouraged by the lack of sidewalks or crosswalks. These conditions are undergirded by decades of generational poverty and disinvestment due to white flight, unfavorable tax policies, and the state’s aggressive efforts to cut resources for Medicaid and limit food stamps.

But Jackson also has a long history of civil rights activism, and its residents in 2013 and again in 2017 elected mayors who promised nothing less than wholesale social and economic transformation. For Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, addressing Jackson’s food access challenge is part of his promise to make it “the most radical city in the world.” But rather than enlisting conventional strategies, the city has mobilized its long-range planning division to lead a new design-based initiative. Bolstered by a $1 million public art grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access” brings together architects and artists alongside chefs, gardeners, food policy experts, and local institutions to facilitate a year of community-engaged interventions at three sites in the city. The project will culminate in a citywide exhibition in the spring of 2020, but ultimately it aims to establish a nonprofit research lab on food access that will operate on a permanent basis to sustain the momentum that is created.

The city invited an intriguing roster of architects and designers from around the country to participate in the multidisciplinary initiative: Kathy Velikov and Geoffrey Thün, directors of RVTR; Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Akoaki; Walter Hood of Hood Design Studio, and Jonathan Tate, who runs his namesake practice, Office of Jonathan Tate. Architects are central to the project, said Travis Crabtree, a senior urban planner with the city and one of the project’s coordinators. “When we first got the grant, people asked, Why are we spending $1 million dollars on an art project when we could feed people for a million?” he said.

Looking more closely at what these designers bring to the table may illustrate what can be gained from this approach. The question of access is at the heart of practices like the Toronto and Ann Arbor, Michigan–based RVTR, led by Velikov and Thün, who are both associate professors at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. In their ongoing project, Protean Prototypes, they conceive of public transit systems as platforms to address access to mobility, food, education, and health. They do this by mapping the social and spatial opportunities for access, connecting underserved areas with local actors who can bridge access gaps and by proposing lightweight spatial prototypes that overlay onto public transit infrastructure, such as bus stops and metro stations. The prototypes might include emerging tech like mobile produce vending systems and bike-cart shares alongside other programs with a small footprint like exercise equipment and book lending programs. Applying this method to Chicago, San Francisco, and Detroit, this complex systems approach brings together architectural and urban scale in new assemblages that amplify the resources already on the ground and take advantage of the larger urban context to channel them where they are needed most.

In Jackson, Velikov and Thün will focus their efforts at the Ecoshed, a 15,000-square-foot, open-air building on a 2-acre industrial site that borders two very different neighborhoods—the rapidly gentrifying Fondren and Virden Addition, one of the poorest in the city. For Fertile Ground, the Ecoshed will demonstrate a self-sustaining closed-loop food system and host the food lab, and eventually host the Fertile Ground nonprofit.

Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Detroit-based Akoaki will also focus their efforts at the Ecoshed. Their practice has engaged with the problem of food access through four years of work with an urban farm in Detroit, the Oakland Avenue Urban Farm. Sirota is also an associate professor of architecture at Taubman. Detroit provides a uniquely fertile landscape for thinking about urban food access. According to Sirota, Detroit has 1,300 urban farms, but none of them are sustainable. At the 6-acre Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, sustainability for Sirota and Farges has meant strategizing beyond economics alone. To them, urban farms are hubs for urban regeneration, and they realized that multiple layers of activity and programming were needed to realize that potential. Like Velikov and Thün, they see architecture as a way of “amplifying the activity that’s already happening on the ground, to stitch together new and productive alliances.”

Detroit may be 1,000 miles from Jackson, but the connection between the two cities runs deep. Like Jackson, Detroit is a majority African American city, with many residents who have ties to Mississippi and other southern states. Thus, the Oakland Avenue farm grows many heritage products from Mississippi. Likewise, the association to agriculture is similarly fraught in both cities; as Sirota noted, “We are highly attuned to the idea that going back to the land isn’t necessarily representationally positive to everyone.” Rather than framing urban farming as a return to an idyllic past (and glossing over the history of slavery and policies that led to the dispossession or denial of land to freed slaves), Akoaki’s urban farm work is firmly sited in the urban. “We’ve become astutely aware that the neo-rural is not rural; it’s something that deserves an aesthetic that hybridizes all the aspirations of the city and combines them with the necessity to produce picturesque landscape and food.” Thus the practice’s design of pop-up performance spaces next to the farm’s kale fields for the Detroit African Funkestra is based on the colors and shapes of shuttered music venues across Detroit.

Another participating architect, Oakland-based landscape architect Walter Hood, has extensive experience designing cultural and urban landscapes. Hood, who is also a professor at University of California, Berkeley’s will focus his efforts at Galloway Elementary in Jackson. The 4.3-acre, publicly owned lot is currently a playfield for a local elementary school. According to the city’s planning department, this site is located in a lower-income residential neighborhood with little public space and bordered by a major street dominated by fast food establishments. The theme here will be on food and community.

This is a good fit for Hood. His projects in Charleston, South Carolina; Macon, Georgia; Detroit, and Philadelphia, among other cities, demonstrate a steady thread of incorporating community feedback, local culture, and collective memory into landscape and urban design. In his Water Table installation at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, Hood tapped into the ecology and history of rice production by mounting thousands of Carolina Gold rice plants in circular planters on a platform in a school courtyard, essentially recreating a rice paddy in downtown Charleston. The project resurfaced the link between rice production and the history of the slave labor that made Carolina’s rice industry possible. Afterwards, the project was dissembled and distributed, planter by planter, across schools and institutions in the area, and lived on to continue the conversation. This archaeological approach also surfaces in many other projects by Hood Studio, including its master plan for Detroit’s Rosa Parks neighborhood. Hood’s work has long engaged with the idea of “being a protagonist in design,” and, in reflecting on the future work in Jackson, asked, “How do we make a landscape powerful, so that once you do it, it has a resonance?”

Finally, at Congress Street, the third Fertile Ground site, New Orleans–based architect Jonathan Tate will bring his experience with food culture and exhibition design to a downtown storefront space. The Congress Street site is close to the heart of government and is intended to amplify the project to public officials and policymakers who work nearby.

For Tate, who designed the Southern Food and Beverage Museum in New Orleans, the task includes not only the adaptive reuse of an existing building but also the design of an outdoor parklet that invites the public in through greenscape and seating. The challenge will be to bring it all together—the art, the history, the contributions of numerous partners, and of course, engage critical feedback, in a downtown that goes quiet at 5 p.m. on weekdays. “Instead of a veneer you’re walking through, it’s about bringing the space of the building out into the street,” he explained.

The architects, along with other Fertile Ground team members, began site visits in April, and will develop their proposals until the citywide expo in 2020.","Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one.

44,"Jun 10, 2020",Northside Sun,“Fertile Ground” Documentary Airing on Mississippi Public Broadcasting and Public Broadcasting,"June 01, 2020 – The City of Jackson announced today that Fertile Ground , a documentary examining the extensive impact the industrial food system has on Jacksonians, will air on June 10th at 7pm CST on the Mississippi Public Broadcasting television station and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) will make the documentary available online here. On June 21st at 5pm CST Mississippi Public Broadcasting will re-air the documentary on their television station.

The Fertile Ground documentary follows the life of local residents experiencing challenges accessing healthy food options, while also detailing the systematic policy failures that have allowed “food swamps” to thrive. Featuring interviews with local farmers, food activists and city leaders, the documentary also spotlights the growing possibility to transform Jackson’s local food system. This documentary is part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Art Challenge. View the trailer here.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said, “This project is so important because we live in abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity and in our society there is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options. In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. And, in spaces where people have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. And so, as a city we should return the love and show our citizens that we want them to have an abundance of healthy food alternatives. The Fertile Ground documentary does an excellent job of portraying just how prevalent the problem of food access is here in our city and I am proud to have members of this administration actively working to remedy this issue for our citizens.”

The documentary team is comprised of homegrown, a host of Mississippi talent including, Executive Producer - Robby Piantanida, Director Alex Warren, Director of Photography, Aaron Phillips, Producer - Jocephus “Skipp” Martin, Sound Mixer, Taiwo Gaynor, Set Photographer - Drew Dempsey. Salam Rida, City of Jackson Urban Designer said, “The documentary is an art project that inspires a larger conversation about the issues with our global food system. The COVID-19 crisis has brought a newfound awareness to Jacksonians about where their food comes from and how global supply chain volatility can disrupt our everyday lives. At the City of Jackson we hope communities can use this moment to move forward on how we would like to address food access and decentralize some aspects of our food system.”

The documentary is part of a larger initiative called “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access”, which uses public art as a medium to inspire dialogue about food access in Jackson, Mississippi. The City of Jackson was awarded the grant from the Bloomberg

Philanthropies Public Art Challenge in November 2018. Mike Bloomberg said, “The Public Art Challenge is designed to strengthen communities like Jackson with moving works of art that highlight complex problems - and foster public discussion about solutions. Fertile Ground does just that, telling the story of a city that has too few healthy food options. It’s also the story of people – like Mayor Lumumba, artists, farmers, urban planners, and other local leaders – who are creating new opportunities to deliver better

options. As the Coronavirus proves especially dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, and as African-American communities suffer the highest death rates, Fertile Ground has taken on new power and urgency.”

In addition to this documentary, the project is made up of physical installations deployed within food deserts across the city, community engagement sessions, a podcast series, performance art, a food policy roadmap, and a project opening expo that has been postponed due to COVID-19. The project brings together an interdisciplinary network of artists, designers, architects, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, policymakers, and community members to discuss the complexities of the City’s food system.

45,"Nov 29, 2019",Mississippi Today,World class chefs making a name for themselves and Southern food culture in cities throughout Mississippi,"BILOXI — There was a time when great chefs were found only in the confines of great culinary cities, such as Paris, New Orleans, Rome, or New York City. But, those days are long gone. There was also a day when small town restaurants served exactly what your mom served at home, and a trained chef was nowhere to be found.

Those days, too, are of the past.

These changes and many more are a consequence of the amazing food revolution that has swept this country, all fueled by the Food Network, the 1980s slow food movement and the access to information the internet has made available to everyone.

Today, cities throughout Mississippi boast world-class restaurants and chefs. Some of the chefs you may have heard of — Chefs Vish Bhatt and John Currence, both from Oxford, Alex Perry of Ocean Springs, Cole Ellis of Cleveland, Derek Emerson and Jesse Houston of Jackson — are all James Beard Foundation nominees (the Academy Awards of the food world). But it doesn’t take a James Beard nomination to make a great chef.

Some chefs have built reputations with starts at prestigious culinary schools, such as the Culinary Institute of America, or apprenticed with well known chefs, but others worked their way up through the ranks, starting by prepping vegetables or washing dishes. For those who have made it to the top of their profession — starts humble or prestigious — the drive to get it right and be the best was in the end more important than the starting point. Names like Chef Ty Thames, Chef Kristian Wade, Chef Milton Joachim and Chef Adrian Halpaus come to mind of other very talented Mississippi chefs.

But these new and talented chefs are not serving traditional fare — not by a long shot. The slow food movement has inspired many chefs to go from farm and Gulf to table. That means fresher produce and ingredients and support for local farmers. New techniques, such as sous-vide and insistence to make everything from scratch has also had a major impact. Combine these attributes with many chefs’ desire to stay Southern, and the result is a new fusion of traditional and cutting edge menus in restaurants across the South.

It’s impossible to mention every chef in the state who is doing creative things, elevating Southern food (country cooking) into the art form that it really is, but two names come to mind that perhaps best exemplify the level of excellence today’s chefs display. Chefs Patti and Matt Kallinikos both work for the IP Casino Resort Spa in Biloxi. They are married, and both are chefs of remarkable merit.

Chef Matt is the room chef (casino-speak for chef de cuisine) at Thirty-Two (IP Casino Resort and Spa, Biloxi), one of the best fine dining restaurants in the South. It has been recognized by many awards, including being a AAA Four Diamond restaurant and Wine Spectator’s Restaurant Wine List Award. Thirty-Two could be described as the most romantic restaurant in Mississippi, for its beautiful appointments and stunning view (especially at sunset). But even without the beautifying ambiance, the food that chef Matt serves would be stunning in any environment.

Chef Matt started as a 15-year-old dish washer, was fascinated by the things he saw going on in the kitchen, decided to go to a culinary school and was accepted into the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park in New York City. It’s one of the most prestigious culinary schools in the country. He received an associate degree in culinary arts, a bachelor’s degree in hospitality and culinary arts and two post graduate degrees in kitchen and dining room management, all from the Culinary Institute of America. He spent time at the Top of the Hub, one of Boston’s best restaurants, then moved to the Thirty-Two in 2005.

Chef Patti took a different route, attending the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, where she studied in the culinary and pastry program. Her background is in stark contrast to Chef Matt’s, certainly less studied, but she is just as much a master in her skills. She joined the IP culinary team as the pastry chef just five years ago, and is the chef in charge of a pastry kitchen that runs full-speed seven days a week, 24 hours a day. If you have ever tried a dessert from Thirty-Two, Tien, Bay View Café or any of the other restaurants at the IP, you know just how talented she is.

Thirty-Two is a from-scratch kitchen. Chef Matt says, “If we need something, we make it,” and that includes all sauces, stocks, soups, bacon, tasso, Italian sausage, pasta, literally everything but the most basic of ingredients. Chef Patti doesn’t have the luxury of making many sauces or charcuterie, but absolutely every cookie, cake, and pie that comes out of her busy kitchen is made from scratch. There is never a short cut or cheaper substitution.

Both chefs design their own menus with approval from executive chef Shannon Johnson, of course. Chef Matt has seasonal menus to contend with, taking into account not only holidays and the spring to winter associations they make for the food they serve, but also the seasonality of ingredients. Chef Patti’s menu planning is a bit more complex, as she has to come up with a different dessert menu for each restaurant. It’s not a skill that is come by lightly.

Chef Patti has pound cakes, banana bread and pies by the score to make but don’t think it is all the traditional sweets you might be used to. She makes a deconstructed pumpkin pie that involves a ginger apple crust and hazelnut topping and an Italian inspired chocolate budino (an Italian pudding cake) that will knock your socks off. Even with the enormous quantities of bakery good her kitchen produces, her level of originality is remarkable.

Chef Matt has his hands full grilling wagyu beef to perfection, making sous vide seared scallops, escargots à la Bourguignonne, lobster and summer truffle mac and cheese, and Thirty-Two’s signature gourmet burger, to touch ever so lightly on the fall menu, typical of the fare Thirty-Two produces in variety and creativity.

Chef Matt and Patti are at the top of their profession, and a visit to thirty-Two or one of the IP’s other restaurants is a true culinary adventure.

But it isn’t just in the rarefied air of a casino kitchen — with the best of all equipment and ingredients — that amazing culinary adventures can be found in Mississippi. It may be the deep fried black eyed peas at the Blue Canoe in Tupelo or the 36-hour smoked pulled pork at the Blue Biscuit in Indianola, but Mississippi chefs, famous or not, are making a name for this state’s food culture and in a big way.","Today, cities throughout Mississippi boast world-class restaurants and chefs.
Names like Chef Ty Thames, Chef Kristian Wade, Chef Milton Joachim and Chef Adrian Halpaus come to mind of other very talented Mississippi chefs.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State students studying landscape architecture, architecture and graphic design are bringing home a national honor for their learning garden concept.

A cross-college consortium of MSU students conceptualized a suite of garden designs aimed at helping schools build learning gardens based on their educational needs. The Living Room: A Freeware Learning Garden Focused on Health, Food and Nutrition Education received an Honor Award for Student Collaboration at the American Society of Landscape Architects, or ASLA. The team, which included 10 landscape architecture students, 10 architecture students and one graphic design student, was recognized at the society’s recent virtual conference.

Cory Gallo, MSU associate professor of landscape architecture in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, served as faculty advisor for the group.

“For the fifth time since 2012, the design/build studio has earned a national design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Many of these awards have been in collaboration with architecture and graphic design faculty and students, including this most recent one,” Gallo said. “The society chose only 35 awards out of 560 applicants this year. The recognition is a continued testament to the unique cross-college process that has been ongoing at Mississippi State for the last decade.”

Gallo explained the garden’s concept was further illustrated in two proof-of-concept designs—one that has been installed at Galloway Elementary School in Jackson and another scheduled for installation at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU in spring 2021.

“The team worked with educators and stakeholders to tailor the design to each site’s individual needs. For instance, the garden at Galloway Elementary emphasized ample teaching space aligned around five themes including math, science and art, which allows teachers to use the garden for almost every subject. This ensures that the garden will be used for not just food education, but as an integral part of the classroom,” Gallo said.

Hans Herrmann, MSU associate professor in the School of Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art and Design, said students benefited from the collaborative hands-on experience.

“The first-hand feedback from trying to construct what was previously just an idea is something that traditional classroom instruction cannot approximate. Issues of material supply, site conditions, transportation logistics, tools and equipment all come into focus once you are standing on the site and realize that you’re the one who has to get the job done,” he said.

Herrmann said he was proud of how multiple disciplines joined together, including MSU alumni, to bridge between areas of expertise and gaps in experience.

“The work of these projects is more than just the hours in the field building and installing the gardens. It’s about building the team, taking ownership and responsibility for key components, and working with other organizations in Mississippi to make the state we call home that much better for the next generation,” he said.

In addition to the national award, the project was featured in a chapter of “Design-Build: Integrating Craft, Service, and Research through Applied Academic Practice,” a textbook by University of Washington Landscape Architecture Professor Daniel Winterbottom which was published by Routledge this year.

In addition to Gallo and Herrmann, Associate Professor Suzanne Powney in the Department of Art’s graphic design concentration advised the graphic student on the project. Associate Professor Ryan Walker in the College of Education’s Department of Curriculum, Instruction and Special Education consulted on the project as well.

Collaborators included The Fertile Ground Project, a Jackson-based program inspiring dialogue about food access; JH&H Architects in Flowood; Utah’s Pikus Concrete; and Pennsylvania’s Significant Developments. The garden at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU is funded through a grant from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi Foundation.

47,"Dec 1, 2020",Civil Eats,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped from the USDA’s Food Box Program,"Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

“’Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes—part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program—came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers—giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce.

“When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers. They were just left out. There was a big void that was left,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director.

Despite Challenges, Program Helps Farmers, Families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers—a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss.

“Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit.

“This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale, Burkett said, because of an incredible upswelling of community support.

“Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” added the farmer. “It brought the community together.”","Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

49,"Dec 26, 2018",Mississippi Today,Gloster’s first grocery store in decades highlights statewide food insecurity,"GLOSTER — For residents here, food excursions would range from the 30 minute round-trip to Centreville, to the 2-hour round-trip to Baton Rouge, La. The nearest Walmart and Kroger, over in McComb, are roughly an hour’s drive each way.

A small rural town in Amite County, Gloster is just south of the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi; it’s less than two square miles in size and home to around a thousand residents, according to the 2016 American Community Survey.

Companies are scared, despite minimal competition, that they won’t make enough of a profit to survive in towns with a small consumer base — towns like Gloster. In a sparsely populated state like Mississippi, this is a common dilemma, especially when it comes to access to food.

But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving. The town’s first grocery store in decades.

“We needed this,” said Felecia Nayland, 56, who’s lived in Gloster all her life. I just hope and pray that they continue to do good business here so they’ll stay here.”

Nayland said previously, access to fruits and vegetables in town was “pretty much non-existent.”

Limited access to grocery stores in rural areas is one reason Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Over half a million Mississippians did not know where their next meal would come from between 2015 and 2017, according to the latest report from Hunger Free America, “The Red, White, and Blue Hunger Wave: A 2018 United States Hunger Atlas.”

Many here see the public-private partnership that brought the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Gloster as part of the solution to an all-too-common problem in rural towns around the state — availability of affordable, fresh food.

Lavonne Sanders, 50, has also lived in Gloster her whole life, and said the last time the town had a store like this was when she was a little girl, about 30-40 years ago. That too was a Piggly Wiggly.

“I love this store, it’s made a big change,” Sanders said. “We don’t have to go Centreville anymore. You don’t have to spend that gas money now.”

While the store licenses the Piggly Wiggly brand, the shop itself is independently owned and operated by Jason Cook. Cook, from Hattiesburg, learned about Gloster a few years ago while at a previous job. The company was considering expansion into the small town, but in the end opted against it. Since then, Cook opened a Piggly Wiggly in Angie, La. — but he didn’t forget about Gloster.

“I came back here when I was financially able to,” Cook said, “just because after having talks with the community I knew how bad it was here. So the Lord led us back here.

“Most companies will turn their nose up at a store doing under $100,000 a week in sales. My approach is a little different; I do it to operate a business, but I also do it out of just having humanity and compassion. The way I do things aren’t necessarily the way anyone else does them.”

The city approved a tax incentive for the store, which will reimburse Cook for exterior improvements like the parking lot and sidewalk repair. Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened. The store created 22 jobs.

“If you can get into a town where the government will help you get established there to lower your overhead (cost), then you can make it,” Cook said. “You don’t get greedy, and you don’t take advantage of people, you just operate. I live within my means. I’ve got to make a profit in order to pay the bills, but I’m not trying to become a millionaire off of it.”

After years of driving out of town, often out of county, to find fresh produce and essentials, residents were prepared to fill Piggly Wiggly; by 3 p.m. on a Monday, the grocery store was the busiest place in Gloster.

“It’s brought some life back to the town,” said Rachel Stevens, 54, who works at a business on Main St. around the corner from the new store.

Stevens and other residents discussed having to cram all their grocery shopping into a couple trips a month.

“We’d have to stock up. It’s really inconvenient when you run out of stuff. We had no choice, no options,” she added.

More than just the convenience, residents think the Piggly Wiggly will lift spirits and create momentum for the town.

“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago. “I knew it was hyped up when people, even in the other counties, would say, ‘Did you hear about the Piggly Wiggly?’ It’s the biggest thing in a long time in this area.”

“It’s gonna be some more changes coming,” Sanders said. “I believe.”

“To hear over the course of several years how badly a grocery store was needed and wanted in the town, and now that the town finally has it, it really is a feeling of bliss and happiness,” said Rep. Angela Cockerham, D-Magnolia, who represents Amite County.

Cockerham, an attorney at Wise Carter, also serves as Gloster’s lawyer. She added that the incentives Piggly Wiggly received could help attract business in other places in Mississippi.

“In the future, I’m hoping that there will be other mechanisms that will help areas like Southwest Mississippi that encourage partnership (between towns and businesses),” she said.

Statewide solutions and the Legislature’s role

Much of the state — about 1 in 5, according to Hunger Free America — struggle with consistent access to nutritional food.

The phenomenon ranges from urban areas, like Hinds County, where 1 in 4 are food insecure, to rural areas like Jefferson County, which had the highest food insecurity rate in the country in 2016 at 36 percent, according to Feeding America.

Can the public-private partnership in Gloster work in the rest of the state? What can the state Legislature do to help?

Every year, lawmakers propose legislation ultimately aimed at reducing food insecurity by either helping grocers located in low-income communities mitigate losses or making groceries more affordable for the general public.

Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Jackson, has pushed for legislation to give tax credits to grocers locating in underserved communities. A 2018 bill would have given these stores a job tax credit equaling 10 percent of its payroll.

Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, authored a 2018 bill to give income tax credits to grocers to offset the cost of purchasing locally grown produce in an attempt to incentivize stores offering healthier food options.

Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, has introduced bills for the last several years to allow state funds to be used as a direct source of funding for grocery stores under the Small Business and Grocer Investment Act passed in 2014.

Each of these bills died in committee with little fanfare.

Simmons said his proposal to use state dollars directly is unlikely to garner the support of leadership. Tax incentives, similar to those Mississippi gives large companies like Nissan and Continental Tire, might be more palatable, Simmons said.

Right now, Mississippi is leveraging tax incentives for industries to locate in the state, but those benefits do not apply to businesses like grocers.

“Because of the number of employees, the kind of wages they’re paying, (grocers) wouldn’t qualify for the same type of incentives that an industry would,” Simmons said.

The federal government’s primary vehicle for providing at least some food to the poor is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly allowances based on the size of the recipient’s household. Mississippi has one of the largest federal matches of any state for these assistance programs.

“We in Mississippi have depended so much on the federal government to feed the hungry in the state that we ourselves are not focused on it,” Simmons said. “We have not stepped up to the plate to give adequate dollars to match that to help those citizens out of their particular situation … We’ve not had to.”

To slightly ease the burden of affording groceries for Mississippi residents, Rep. Jeramey Anderson, D-Escatawpa, repeatedly proposes legislation to remove the sales tax levied on food items for all shoppers. SNAP purchases are already exempt from sales tax. A version of the same bill from Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, would have also increased all other sales tax from seven to nine percent.

“In my opinion, the best way to provide a tax cut to our constituents, especially those in the middle and working class, is to eliminate this sales tax (on food),” said Anderson, who plans on reintroducing the bill next session. “And I know that of course there has to be a make-up of the revenue lost from taxes on groceries, but I think phasing it out, which is what this bill does over five years, is a responsible way of doing that without hitting the state’s revenue so hard. I think the sales tax on groceries is one of, if not the most, regressive taxes we have.”

Both bills also died, as well as several bills to raise the state minimum wage, which currently mirrors the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, to between $8.25 and $10.10.

Considering low wages across the state, Mississippi families cannot always rely on a job to provide food security. The “U.S. Hunger Atlas” also shows that nearly 13 percent of working adults, or 156,213 employees, also faced food insecurity between 2015 and 2017.

The report also calculated that Mississippi residents would need to spend an additional $273 million each year on food to meet their basic nutritional needs. That’s roughly one-third the amount Mississippi spent, $841.8 million, through the SNAP program in 2017.

“When you get into a situation and you do it for so long, it just becomes a way of life,” Simmons said. “If we do more at the state level, we could actually become a state of change, where we are transitioning our people from poverty to prosperity.”

At the Mississippi Center for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on racial and economic issues, Madeline Morcelle and Kathryn Rehner promote a wide-range of solutions to tackle the root causes of food insecurity.

“In order to achieve a food secure Mississippi, the state legislature will need to take on a broad range of social, economic, and physical barriers to healthy food access,” Morcelle said. “Those include everything from poverty, which is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of people still aren’t paid a living wage; measures to improve the minimum wage would improve food security. I think tax incentives and other measures to incentivize investments from food retailers are important.

“Ultimately, though, there isn’t one solution. It will take a combination of state reform addressing the multiplicity of factors that result in food insecurity, from lack of transportation, to inadequate income, to lack of opportunity in many communities, to protecting and strengthening our essential nutritional assistance programs like SNAP that provide that emergency lifeline to struggling families.”","But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving.

51,"May 28, 2020",TechCrunch,Amazon expands use of SNAP benefits for online grocery to 11 more states – TechCrunch,"Amazon customers in nearly a dozen more U.S. states are now able to use their SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits to purchase groceries online, the retailer announced on Thursday. The news represents a significant expansion of a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) pilot program introduced in 2019 that aimed to open up online grocery shopping to those on public assistance. This program is even more critical now, as in-store shopping puts consumers at risk of contracting the deadly novel coronavirus.

To date, participating retailers in the USDA pilot program have included Walmart, Amazon, ShopRite and other smaller chains.

Amazon confirmed to TechCrunch that the 11 new states that now support using SNAP for online grocery include those that were added starting last week through today, Thursday, May 28.

The initial expansion of the pilot added New Mexico, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, which all became active last week. On Tuesday of this week, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and New Jersey rolled out. And today, Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia were added as well.

With these additions, Amazon customers on public assistance can shop online for groceries across a total of 25 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. At checkout, they can pay for groceries using their SNAP EBT.

Including the new states, Amazon now offers the use of SNAP EBT for online grocery in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

However, Amazon is not the only retailer offering online grocery for SNAP EBT customers in these 25 states.

According to the USDA’s website, SNAP users can now order their groceries online through either Amazon or Walmart in these markets.

The site also indicates that Amazon is the only retailer supporting the District of Columbia at present. In addition, ShopRite supports the use of SNAP for online groceries in Maryland, New Jersey and New York. And Wright’s Markets is participating in the pilot program in Alabama.

The USDA’s website indicates several more states are now in the planning phase, so they can add online purchasing as a shopping option soon. These include Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wyoming.

As part of Amazon’s participation in the USDA program, it not only enabled the use of SNAP EBT as a payment method, it also made its Amazon Fresh service available to SNAP recipients in states where Fresh is available without requiring a Prime membership. And it offered free shipping on both Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry orders.

At launch, Amazon had said the USDA pilot program would “dramatically increase access to food for more remote customers.”

However, in the coronavirus era, access to online grocery can be a life-saving measure for some.

The pandemic has complicated access to food for those on SNAP benefits, and for high-risk individuals on SNAP in particular. These consumers now have to risk getting COVID-19 every time they go out for groceries themselves. And as more workers become unemployed due to the economic impacts from the pandemic, more people are joining public assistance programs like SNAP.

In light of the pandemic, the USDA said it would fast-track any state that wanted to join the pilot. California, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas, West Virginia, D.C., North Carolina and Vermont were just approved in April, for example. In May, the USDA approved Minnesota, Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, New Mexico and Wyoming.

In less than six weeks, the USDA has expanded access to the program to a total of 36 states plus D.C., it says, though many are not yet live. When they launch, however, online purchasing for groceries will be available to more than 90% of SNAP participants, the USDA has noted.","To date, participating retailers in the USDA pilot program have included Walmart, Amazon, ShopRite and other smaller chains.

54,"Jan 16, 2020",Washington Post,"14 states, D.C. and New York City sue to stop Trump plan to slash food stamps for 700,000 unemployed people","In the lawsuit, attorneys general from the District, Maryland, Virginia, New York, California and other states, warned that “drastic” cuts would affect 688,000 to 850,000 adults without children. They asserted the justification for the cuts were based on no evidence and ignored local labor market conditions.

“States are in the best position to evaluate local economic circumstances and to determine where there are insufficient job opportunities such that work requirements would be ineffective,” they said in a 99-page lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Washington. The new rule “eliminates State discretion and criteria” and will terminate “essential food assistance for benefits recipients who live in areas with insufficient jobs.”

The lawsuit is the latest confrontation between the Trump administration and Democratic-governed states, one set off by aiming changes at a program that serves poor and unemployed people and disproportionately affects large cities. Other proposed changes would push 3 million off food assistance.

In the lawsuit, states along the northeastern U.S. corridor joined by California, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Oregon said their governments would face heavy new administrative and financial burdens, economic damages and increased costs from “the negative health effects of malnutrition and instability.”

“President Trump’s unlawful changes to the SNAP rule will strip nutrition assistance from tens of thousands of struggling District residents, putting their health at risk while driving up District health care costs and needlessly hampering our economy,” D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) said in a statement.

“We are bringing this lawsuit to protect SNAP recipients nationwide and to check an administration that is attempting another end-run around Congress to advance its heartless agenda,” Racine said, adding the Republican-led Congress in 2018 rejected the changes as punishing people struggling to find jobs.

Racine said in the District, for example, while the region is booming for high-income workers, many of the 13,000 recipients directly at risk of losing food aid each month once cuts take effect in April are low-skilled adults without degrees or training who must compete for a small slice of low-wage jobs.

AD

“Locking them out of food assistance will not encourage them to work. . . . It will force them to choose between putting food on the table or keeping a roof over their heads,” Racine said., making “it harder for them to acquire the skills and training they need to find jobs.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents between the ages of 18 and 49 can receive benefits for a maximum of three months during a three-year period, unless they are working or enrolled in an education or training program for 80 hours a month.

States have been able to waive this time limit to ensure access to food stamps during the ups and downs of reentering the workforce. Before this rule, counties with an unemployment rate as low as 2.5 percent were included in waived areas.

AD

AD

The new rule, set to take effect on April 1, 2020, will tighten the criteria for states applying for such waivers, making 6 percent the minimum unemployment rate for a county to receive a waiver.

In announcing the change last year, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said, “This is about restoring the original intent of food stamps . . . moving more able-bodied Americans to self sufficiency.”

Perdue cited the economic expansion as a basis for tightening states’ waivers. He said the number of Americans receiving benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has grown from 17 million to more than 36 million since 2000, although the unemployment rate is now lower.

AD

Two other proposed rule changes, not yet final, aim to cap deductions for utility allowance and to limit access to SNAP for working poor families.

AD

A study by the Urban Institute shows the combined impact of these rules would cut 3.7 million people from SNAP in an average month. Benefits would be reduced for millions more, and 982,000 students would lose automatic access to free or reduced-price school meals.

Critics say the changes would bite even harder during the next economic downturn.

In a joint conference call with reporters, New York State Attorney General Letitia A. James (D) added, for unemployed people from rural Appalachia to the Mississippi River delta to the Bronx in New York, “SNAP benefits are often the difference between eating and going hungry. It’s that simple.”","Other proposed changes would push 3 million off food assistance.

55,"Aug 21, 2019",Mississippi Today,Meat processing companies targeted in ICE immigration raids awarded millions in state grants,"help

Peco Foods Inc. and Koch Foods, both

food processing companies targeted in immigration enforcement raids in early August.

Since 2009, Mississippi taxpayers paid nearly $4 million toMississippi offers a variety of economic development programs to businesses, including tax incentives, grants and loans to encourage companies to locate or expand in the state, with the ultimate goal of bringing jobs to Mississippians. Mississippi Development Authority spokesperson Melissa Scallan said that none of the food processing companies raided in the recent immigration enforcement operation — the nation’s largest in a decade — received traditional tax incentives from the state.The companies benefited from other incentives awarded to local governments for help with infrastructure improvements, including road construction and water and sewer systems. In some cases, the awards went unspent and returned to the state because either the company or local government could not meet certain requirements. When taking the unspent funds into account, the state has earmarked close to $9 million for the Peco and Koch companies in the past decade. MDA, the state’s economic development agency, administers grants through its Community Services Division, its Financial Resources Division and the federal Hurricane Katrina Community Development Block Grant to assist communities affected by the 2005 hurricane. The development authority awards grants through its Community Services Division and the federal Katrina grant to local entities, such as towns or counties, to make public improvements benefiting nearby plants in exchange for those companies’ promises to add jobs to their facilities. Grants from the Financial Resources Division go directly to companies, but they must have a local sponsor, such as an economic development group. Regional development agencies also assist companies in receiving similar grants. In 1999, the Central Mississippi Planning and Development District prepared a grant application for the city of Canton, according to a 2018 report celebrating it’s 50th anniversary , which led to $1.2 million in infrastructure improvements to support expansion at the local Peco plant. Here is a list of grants the state awarded to three of the companies — Peco Foods, Inc., Koch Foods and Pearl River Foods — targeted in the raids:Bay Springs received a $1,093,480 Katrina block grant and spent $1,092,800 of it “to replace damaged and underperforming equipment at the city’s existing wastewater treatment facility.” In exchange, Peco promised to retain 550 existing jobs at its Bay Springs plant, one of those raided in August.The town of Lake received a $1.3 Katrina block grant and spent $1,289,416.26 on infrastructure improvements, such as water and wastewater extensions and a new access road for Peco’s new feed mill in exchange for 28 new jobs.Morton received $712,500 in Community Service Division funds and spent $712,326.78 making improvements on publicly-owned Koch access roads. Koch created 36 jobs.Morton received $1.06 million in Community Service Division funds and spent $897,639.50 making improvements on publicly-owned Koch access roads. Koch created 80 jobs.Leake County received a $1.5 million Community Service Division award for improvements to publicly-owned sites and buildings, but bids for the project came in much higher than $1.5 million and the county could not make up the difference. It left the money on the table and Pearl River Foods paid for the improvements.On behalf of Peco, local development agency Golden Triangle LINK received a $2.5 million grant for building improvements and $500,000 in “MS Works” funds for workforce training through the development authority’s Financial Resources Division. Peco acquired an empty warehouse in West Point to transform into freezer, cooler and storage space. The state awarded Peco the grants in exchange for 300 new jobs, but Peco “was not certain it would be able to create 300 jobs,” Scallan said, so the funds were never transferred. Peco received 10 years of ad valorem tax exemptions from West Point and Clay County and reduced rates for city water, according to a May, 2018 story in The Columbus Dispatch .

56,"Apr 30, 2018",,Peco Foods to open $40M Mississippi plant,"JACKSON, Miss. — An Alabama-based chicken processor will open a plant in northeast Mississippi to make and distribute frozen chicken products.

Peco Foods on Monday announced its plan to invest $40 million in West Point, hiring 300 people over the next four years.

The nation's eighth-largest poultry processor, Peco says it needs more capacity to supply its customers, including restaurants, grocers and food service distributors.

""The addition of this new cold storage facility is a key component of our growth strategy and is perfectly tailored to meet our current needs as well as future plans,"" Peco Foods CEO Mark Hickman said in a statement.

State and local incentives, including grants, property tax reductions and a discounted water and sewer rate, could benefit Peco by $13.7 million over 10 years.

Tuscaloosa-based Peco bought a vacant 185,000-square-foot cold storage warehouse in December that it plans to renovate to house the operation, said Mississippi Development Authority spokeswoman Tammy Craft.

She said the state will give Peco a $2.5 million grant to improve wastewater treatment and infrastructure. West Point has approved a cheaper water and sewer rate for high-volume users, which will save Peco up to $3.9 million over 10 years, depending on usage.

Peco will build a plant to pretreat its wastewater before sending it to the city for further treatment. West Point has additional water and sewer capacity to offer because it previously served the Sara Lee/Bryan Foods complex, which closed in 2007.

The state will also provide $500,000 for worker training.

West Point and Clay County have approved 10-year property tax breaks worth an estimated savings of $6.8 million over that time.

Clay County had suffered for years from persistently high unemployment. The county had a 5.4 percent jobless rate in March, compared to a 4.5 percent jobless rate statewide. Officials said last fall that the company will pay workers $15 to $17 an hour.

57,"Dec 2, 2020",Eater,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped From the USDA’s Food Box Program,"This story was originally published on Civil Eats.

Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation. “‘Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes — part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program — came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South with diminished access to produce.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers — giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce. “When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director. “They were just left out. There was a big void that was left.”

Despite challenges, program helps farmers, families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers — a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss. “Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit. “This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale because of an incredible upswelling of community support. “Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” Burkett said. “It brought the community together.”

It all seemed like a grand success. So, the Federation and its farmers were surprised when then USDA rejected its application for the third round of Farmers to Families. The sting was especially severe given the long history of discrimination against Black farmers by the USDA. And they weren’t alone; other small farmers were also caught off guard by the lack of new contracts, and some were stuck with unharvested crops they had planted for the boxes.

A USDA spokesperson told Civil Eats by email that the agency modified the program after the first two rounds “to address feedback from nonprofit organizations that there was not adequate distribution of all different types of food boxes.” As a result, vendors had to bid for new contracts. They are now required to provide “combination boxes” (a mix of meat, dairy, and produce), identify their community partners and “last mile delivery” arrangements (in response to previous criticism about lack of such services), and gear their distribution to so-called “opportunity zones.”

Due to the shift, the contracts went exclusively to a small number of large national food distributors. At least half of the initial contracts were not renewed in the fall, and that number has been whittled down even more in the final months of the program.

For Burkett’s co-op, the loss of the contract meant a slew of surplus crops with no customers. And while restaurants had started reopening, most are only operating at one-third of their typical capacity, he said.

Now, says Burkett, “the food service companies don’t put much produce in their boxes.” His co-op is hopeful it can get another contract, if the program continues — but the farmers must make alternative plans for now. And without a sense of where he can sell next year’s crops, he doesn’t know what to plant.

Communities left without food

The changes to the food box program have also led to chaos and hardship for many of the organizations on the receiving end, according to interviews by Civil Eats and several complaints filed by lawmakers. (One of the largest recipients is alleged to have redirected $3 million to its own nonprofit despite a lack of track record in delivering food to people in need, House Democrats have alleged.)

The USDA acknowledged that while some nonprofits that did not receive boxes in the first two rounds received them in the third round, others received fewer boxes or none at all. “USDA made painstaking efforts to ensure comprehensive coverage for the states, with the goal of covering every county in the country,” the spokesperson said.

But none of the groups previously served by the farmers affiliated with the Federation are currently participating in the program, and that means thousands of families in the South are lacking access to food.

The Federation has intimate knowledge of the Black community in the South and the local groups and community organizers who serve it. As a result, its boxes reached people who “are usually not on anyone’s radar,” said Chawnn Redden, the Federation’s regional marketing coordinator. “We sought out where the real need was, as opposed to just taking the easy route and giving it out to the nearest food bank.”

“We sought out where the real need was, as opposed to just taking the easy route and giving it out to the nearest food bank.”

The senior center in Laurel was one such example. The boxes that landed there were directed to hundreds of families. Cooley, the coordinator, ran food drives, worked with local pastors and community organizations, and drove to the homes of elders who were stuck at home. Reaching people by word of mouth and finding elderly men who seldom ask for help was especially important, Cooley said, and it’s something that traditional food banks rarely do. “Some people have a lot of pride, but when they had a chance to get the food, they would reach out to me,” she said.

Since the Federation’s contract ended, area churches have continued giving limited assistance, but they haven’t had the capacity to fulfill the community’s growing need, Cooley said. She hasn’t found another food box distributor.

“People still call me,” she said. “They ask: ‘Miss Cooley, when are we going to get some more food?’ I don’t feel good at all when somebody truly needs help and we have nothing to give them.”

Another of the Federation’s partners was Mississippi Rising Coalition, a nonprofit that delivered about 500 food boxes every week to both rural and urban communities across the state over the summer.

“These areas are not only impacted by COVID, but they’re also food deserts where nutritious food is hard to come by, expensive, or inaccessible,” said Lea Campbell, the organization’s president. “The food box program filled a really desperate need and I don’t understand the rationale behind ending the [Federation’s] contract.”

James Skinner, the director of the group’s Food Security Initiative, personally drove a rented U-Haul truck from the Gulf Coast to Mississippi’s Pine Belt to deliver the boxes to community centers, immigrant advocacy groups, international students, and a university food pantry. Hundreds of volunteers worked to make the deliveries and distribution a success. “It was very disappointing when the contract ended,” Skinner said. “The hardest thing was to turn people away.”

Mississippi Rising has not been able to connect with one of the new USDA-approved box distributors since its contract ended in September. The group has continued to occasionally provide food when they receive direct donations from farmers, but Skinner and Campbell say the donations in no way match the consistency and volume of the food box program.

Gainesville-based Hispanic Alliance of Georgia, another group the Federation supplied over the summer, is having a similar experience. “The company that supplies [food boxes to] Georgia is in Florida and is not answering the phone,” said Vanessa Sarazua, the Alliance’s executive director. “We can’t reach them and we need to be able to provide this food.”

In Gainesville, where the Latinx community is more than 40 percent of the population and most Latinos toil in low-wage jobs such as poultry processing plants, the more than 40 agencies that are part of the food bank distribution system rarely serve their needs, said Sarazua. The boxes helped fill this gap.

For communities that are still receiving boxes, the contents have changed significantly. Despite the promise of “locally sourced” produce, as touted in Trump’s letter, many of the boxes now come packed with processed meat and other commodities. According to the USDA, for rounds three and four, contractors were required to include “1 or 2 locally grown fruit or vegetable items, as available, and if none available, add additional items of vendors choice.”

“In essence, it’s gone from a model where we’re serving collard greens and peas to serving hot dogs,” Blanding of the Federation said. “Yeah, people are eating. But I think it matters [what they eat]. So, this shift is concerning.”

Limited model program continues

Knowing the program had been a lifesaver to both farmers and hungry families, the Federation is working to build off of the USDA model and continue providing its own food boxes. The organization has started using private funding to pay member farmers for their produce and continue to send food boxes to its partners.

But the Federation’s private efforts have only been able to provide a fraction of the previous amount of produce, said Redden. “[The shift] dramatically reduced what we could purchase from farmers who had hopes they would be participating through the end of the year.”

Moving forward, Blanding says that providing families with a box of raw ingredients direct from farmers is an approach that makes sense with or without the pandemic: “It’s a model to build off for providing food during disasters, as well as something that could be extended as part of the social programs of our country.”

Sarazua of Hispanic Alliance of Georgia agrees. “Hopefully, the USDA can look at it as a future model to more directly reach vulnerable children and families.”

Struggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloat

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state's food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a long-standing initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

""All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,"" said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. ""When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.""

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don't have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic's early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

""If food banks can't take more product (from the California program), farmers are going to go out of business,"" Linkhart said. ""That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.""

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

""That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,"" said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. ""It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.""

Raudabaugh said the state's dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers' distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don't make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

""We're providing many hundreds of percents more (to food banks) than pre-pandemic,"" Raudabaugh said. ""Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these (partnerships). It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.""

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

""The money has to be there to justify the harvest,"" Michael said, ""and this solves some of that problem.""

On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen's small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers' pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

""It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,"" Van Laanen said. ""It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.""

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he's already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi's Farm stay afloat.

""It was really timely,"" Chichester said. ""It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early time frame.""

Karen Affeld, the development group's executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

""Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,"" she said. ""That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.""

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state's Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California's that launched in 2014.

It's a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they're harvesting crops bound for food banks.

""Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,"" said David Bobanick, the group's executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another 4 pounds are donated by farmers.

""Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,"" he said. ""It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.""

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

""Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,"" said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets' food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she's heard from parents who couldn't otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture _ known as CSA _ in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program's website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

""You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,"" said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. ""People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.""

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

""We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,"" Lebeaux said. ""Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.""

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

""We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,"" said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. ""One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.""

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

""If there's one silver lining,"" she said, ""it's that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.""","Farmers and food banksStruggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloatAs the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers.

During World War II, approximately 40% of recruits couldn’t enlist due to poor nutrition. Today, over 70% of would-be recruits are ineligible for a number of contributing factors, including nutrition and obesity. It’s become a matter of national security, according to an organization of retired generals.

""Seventy years ago, a military leader said a lack of nutritional food in our children and young adults contributed to military readiness,"" said retired Army Maj. Gen. Larry Harrington. ""We've made some improvements but we have a long, long way to go.""

Mission: Readiness is a national group made up of over 75 retired admirals and general across the country that focuses on helping children stay in school, in shape and out of trouble. The organization issued a report Wednesday, Improving Childhood Nutrition in Mississippi, that highlighted the need for federally funded programs that give children access to fresh and healthy food.

Wednesday morning, three generals from Mission: Readiness met with agencies from across Mississippi in a roundtable discussion in Jackson about child nutrition.

Nationally, 72% of those 17 to 24 years old are not able to qualify for the military due to lack of education, criminal background, substance abuse or medical disqualifiers. Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility in the nation, with 76% of eligible 17- to 24- year-olds not being able to qualify, said retired Army Brig. Gen. Roger Shields.

Obesity is one of the leading disqualifiers, he said. Twenty-five percent of 10- to 17- year-olds were obese in the state in 2018, while 40% of adults were obese.

""We believe that America must prioritize efforts to combat childhood obesity as a matter of national security,"" Shields said in a written statement released after the roundtable. ""Improving access to fresh and nutritious foods for all children will help reduce childhood obesity and ultimately ensure that the military has a pool of recruits.""

There is a ""network"" of federal nutrition programs available across Mississippi working to combat the issue but many don't know what is available to them, said retired Army Maj. Gen. Augustus Collins, a former adjutant general of Mississippi.

Collins cited the National School Lunch Program, Summer Food Service Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

According to the Mission: Readiness report, in 1945, Gen. Lewis Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, testified in front of Congress that at least 40% of recruits were rejected during World War II for reasons released to poor nutrition.

The National School Lunch program was founded the following year ""to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals,"" Collins said.

Recalling Hershey's testimony, Collins said, ""The lack of nutritious food for our children is actually a threat to national security.""

""It was back in World War II and it is today,"" he said.

Statistics: Nutrition, obesity and the military

In Mississippi, 76% of youth between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot serve in the military due to issues such as lack of education, a record of crime or substance abuse, or medical disqualifiers; higher than the national average of 71%.

Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility among all 50 states.

Obesity is one of the main medical disqualifiers. Individuals who would otherwise be eligible to serve in the military are being disqualified due to excess weight.

In Mississippi, nearly 40% of adults and 25% of children ages 10-17 were obese in 2018, the highest in the nation. In some counties, the percentage increases to 45.

Mississippi has the second highest rate of child food insecurity in the country. In 2016, over 24% of Mississippi children experienced food insecurity. The national average is 18 percent.

Between 2015 and 2017, over 17% of all households in Mississippi experienced food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at a higher rate for obesity.

Mississippi has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country at 17%.

In Mississippi, 37,000 participants, or 7% of National School Lunch Program participants, accessed the Summer Food Service Program, meaning a large majority of students may not have access to healthy food during the summer break.

61,"Dec 21, 2019",NPR,New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion,"New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Danny Moloshok/AP Danny Moloshok/AP

Some low-income college students are among the 688,000 food stamp recipients projected to lose benefits as a result of a Trump administration rule announced Dec. 4. While the rule explicitly targets ""able-bodied adults without dependents,"" it also limits food assistance for a share of college students at a time when campuses across the country are grappling with how to respond to food insecurity.

The new rule makes it harder for states to waive the requirement that adults work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — benefits. Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.

""As long as a student is at least half-time, they are not considered an [able-bodied adult without dependents] subject to SNAP work requirements, so that new rule would not impact them,"" says Kathryn Larin, director of the Education Workforce and Income Security Team at the Government Accountability Office. ""The group that it would impact would be students enrolled less than half-time.""

Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

This is because Congress created the program with the image of a ""traditional"" student in mind: someone entering college directly from high school, financially reliant on their parents, with no income or dependents.

But this archetype is far from universal, says Parker Gilkesson, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy who specializes in income and work supports. Only about 1 in 4 students attend a four-year institution immediately after high school.

Many college students are older or are parents themselves. And few have a financial safety net: Countless families are spending all they have just to send their children to college, let alone pay for their food and other necessities, she says.

""[Congress] did recognize there are circumstances where students could and should be eligible for SNAP, and so they set up a number of exceptions from this prohibition against college students getting SNAP,"" Larin said. ""What are those exemptions, who is eligible for them, how do you meet those exemptions? That's where the confusion comes in.""

In order for college students to be eligible for SNAP, they must first meet income and asset limits, household qualifications and immigration status requirements. Those who are enrolled less than half of the time — as defined by their school — can then qualify under standard SNAP rules.

Students enrolled more than half of the time may qualify for SNAP by meeting one of a number of criteria, which include being responsible for a dependent child younger than 6, working at least 20 hours a week in paid employment, receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, participating in an on-the-job training program, being outside the 18-49 age range, and being unable to work for health reasons.

""No matter if they're full time, part time, half time, even taking one class, [students] are taking the initiative to really better themselves and grow and further their academic career,"" Gilkesson says. ""They shouldn't be punished for not being able to find steady employment in the economy that we are in today.""

Gilkesson says it is unclear exactly how many students will lose benefits as a result of the new rule, particularly because able-bodied adults without dependents are not necessarily also classified as students if they are enrolled part time. But she adds it is clear that the rule will disproportionately impact young people, people of color and those who struggle to find employment, leaving them without much-needed food assistance.

""Most people who receive SNAP who can work, do work,"" she says. ""But there are a lot of jobs and specifically low-wage jobs out here that have volatile schedules ... people can be let go at any time, so we shouldn't allow people to go hungry just based on their ability to maintain work.""

According to National Center for Education Statistics data on unduplicated year-round enrollment, 5.8 million students were enrolled in public two-year colleges in fall 2017. About 2.1 million were full time, and 3.7 million were part time. Gilkesson says that while there are more students enrolled part time in community colleges than in four-year institutions, food insecurity exists on all types of campuses.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat. This was among the findings of a 2018 Government Accountability Office report that also said almost 2 million at-risk students who were potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits in 2016.

Only 4 in 10 students who are potentially eligible for SNAP are actually enrolled in the program, according to Gilkesson. This is due to perceived stigma as well as confusion about who can apply for SNAP and how to do so.

""The information that's available from the USDA ... is difficult to find on their website and also hard to understand, it's very legal language,"" says Larin, adding that people whose jobs it is to connect college students with these resources may struggle to understand the criteria. Advocates worry that the new rule will exacerbate this confusion.

The GAO report released last December made two recommendations: that the Food and Nutrition Service (which is part of U.S. Department of Agriculture) improve the information on its website to make it easier to find and understand, and that it take a more active role in sharing states' best practices for connecting students to SNAP. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations but has not yet implemented them as of mid-December 2019.

Gilkesson received SNAP in college and was a SNAP worker at a county agency in North Carolina prior to her current job. She says it was not until she saw the other side of the ""intricate"" process that she realized how much information she never received as a student, both because she didn't know what to tell workers and because they didn't always know what to ask.

As a SNAP worker, she saw the impact that fresh food and hot meals had on clients' lives.

""You need food to live, you need food to work, you need food to thrive,"" Gilkesson says. ""And hunger does not make people more employable either.""

In fact, she adds, hunger makes it harder for people to find well-paying jobs that align with their skills and often leads to cycles of being laid off, having to find a new job quickly and missing out on the opportunity to gain the education, training and skills necessary for more meaningful and sustainable employment.

She says research shows that SNAP encourages work and that the idea that people experiencing poverty don't want to get jobs is ""implicit bias.""

The Trump administration says the new rule is intended to promote SNAP recipients entering the workforce. Critics have slammed the change for eliminating food assistance for nearly 700,000 people, many of whom already struggle to find work.

Gilkesson says it is concerning that college students will lose benefits, but the prevalence of food insecurity should be an issue regardless of who is experiencing it.

""No one should be hungry,"" she says. ""That's a basic necessity. And when we start to think about it in that way, we really will start to see the policy change that we need to see.""

62,"Aug 27, 2020",WSAW,Chopped champ Nick Wallace raises awareness about food insecurity and how communities can help,"WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Having access to healthy food is a global challenge and one that impacts thousands of US cities and over 40 million people nationwide. For many Americans -- particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and rural areas -- small grocery stores that once helped to feed the community have been closed and replaced by convenience stores, and liquor stores that primarily sell ultra-processed junk and snack foods.

According to Feeding America, even in the world’s greatest food-producing nation, children and adults face poverty and hunger in every county across America. The statistics are alarming:

In 2018, more than 37 million people struggled with hunger in the United States, including more than 11 million children.

A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life.

Children are more likely to face food insecurity than any other group in the United States.

In Mississippi—which has the highest obesity rate of any state—over 70 percent of food stamp eligible households travel more than 30 miles to reach a supermarket. Adults living in “food desert” counties lacking large supermarkets are 23 percent less likely to consume the recommended fruits and vegetables than those in counties with supermarkets. As part of Dole’s promise to sustainably provide good nutrition for 1 billion people by increasing access to under-served communities, the brand recently launched an initiative, partnering with Boys & Girls Club, Up in Farms, Smoothie King, which addresses nutritional access and education needs in one of America’s largest food deserts.

Nationally recognized Chef Nick Wallace joined NewsChannel 7 at 4 on Thursday to discuss food insecurity, how we can educate communities about proper nutrition, and how people can help in their own communities. He also showcased simple, healthy dishes that promote optimal nutrition and discussed the unique approach Dole is taking by empowering kids to make better choices by learning about where their food comes from and how to cook it.

63,"May 8, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Mississippi identified as most food insecure state in U.S. - The Vicksburg Post,"By Mississippi Today

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.
The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates.

Dole chose Jackson, Mississippi, due to the city being one of the nation’s largest food deserts.

“Our program goes beyond donations to address the critical challenges of accessibility and affordability, as well as nutrition education in communities around the world,” said Pier Luigi Sigismondi, President of Dole Worldwide Packaged Foods. “Jackson will serve as a blueprint for how we’re going to tackle these challenges in other food deserts using a hyper-local model. Together with partners, we’re building a foundation that will drive systemic change within individual communities and our society at large.”

Dole has seen the negative impact on the community of Jackson due to the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of access to full-service grocery stores, farmers’ markets, and other vendors that sell nutritious fruits and vegetables has created food deserts and food swamps across the country, a press release explained.

Shoppers can nominate the next city that will be named as Dole’s Sunshine for All location. Selections will be made by Dole based on needs such as access to fresh foods. The second Dole Sunshine for All destination will be announced on Giving Tuesday, December 1, 2020.

As noted earlier, Jackson was chosen because it represents the conditions of a food desert. It has only 20 grocery stores, and of those stores, less than 5 percent stock locally-grown fresh produce. In contrast, there are 70 fast-food restaurants, 60 convenience stores, and 150 gas stations that primarily sell unhealthy options.

Dole has partnered with local chefs and organizations to help get the word out and spread the word about the benefits and ease of working with fresh produce.

With the confidence of a Food Network chef, Braxton, a parent of five and grandmother of three, put a skillet on the burner, poured some oil into the pan, and let it heat up before throwing in some chopped onion, frozen corn, frozen lima beans (called butter beans in the South), and black-eyed peas, narrating all the while. After covering the pan and letting it all heat up, she added stewed tomatoes, okra, and seasonings.

“Okra is the last vegetable I put in because it’s easy for it to fall apart,” said Braxton, who hails from Mississippi. “Okra has a bad rap. I’m standing up for okra!”

This virtual dinner party is part of a Portland, Oregon-based program called Grandma’s Hands, a platform for Black grandmothers to share family recipes and food traditions with future generations. So far, the 12 grandmothers involved have prepared four monthly meals for 30 to 40 participants at a time. In addition to delivering the food they make along with a bag of fresh produce grown by farmers of color to the participants throughout the community, the program brings everyone together virtually to partake of the food while sharing recipes and tips.

Though the focus of Grandma’s Hands is to facilitate community engagement and reconnect community members with culturally grounded natural foods and agricultural practices, the program may also help reduce food insecurity by teaching the younger generation the economic benefits of cooking at home for their families.

“Our [modern] life is not conducive to being healthy,” says Chuck Smith, co-founder of the Black Food Sovereignty Coalition (BFSC), which helps run the program. “Cooking as a regular family activity has been squeezed out of people’s schedules.” And yet, he stressed the fact that connection with food is a pathway to stronger identity in the Black community. “When your [diet] is consciously connected to your cultural identity, then you can be more intentional in selecting what you eat and how you prepare it,” adds Smith.

The idea for the series grew out of freewheeling conversations about sustainable food and food access that Willie Chambers and Lynn Ketch from the Rockwood Community Development Corporation (CDC) had with Lisa Cline and Katrina Ratzlaff, the CEO and advancement director at Wallace, a community health clinic.

Cline and Ratzlaff were eager to find out more about food access in Rockwood, a diverse neighborhood of the Portland suburb of Gresham, because many of their patients at Wallace are food insecure. Rockwood, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Multnomah County, has many fast food outlets but only one grocery store. And that lack of access to nutritious food has alarming health consequences for residents, who suffer from diet-related illness at a higher rate than residents of any other part of Oregon. According to Brad Ketch, president of the Rockwood CDC, life expectancy there is a full decade shorter than it is in the rest of Multnomah County.

At the meeting, Cline and Ratzlaff began reminiscing about their own food traditions. “I said something like, ‘My memories of cooking and sharing food were standing by my grandma at the kitchen counter,’” Ratzlaff said. “‘I think a lot of folks are like that. Grandmas are the anchor. In many communities, they take care of the kids and do the cooking.’” Chambers, in turn, reminisced about his wife, Vanessa, a grandmother of eight who loves being in the kitchen with their grandchildren. “She’d give them aprons, and they’d all have a tool,” he said. “And they enjoy it!”

Chambers was reminded of the Bill Withers’ song Grandma’s Hands, and before he’d even nailed down the concept, they had the perfect name. The idea for the dinners took shape quickly.

Connecting Over Food

Grandma’s Hands started in June and takes place on the third Saturday of every month. It’s funded by a specialty crop grant from the Oregon Department of Agriculture and run by the Rockwood CDC and BFSC. Originally, the plan had involved in-person dinner parties at Rockwood’s Sunrise Center, which has a spacious commercial kitchen, but COVID-19 toppled that idea and they moved the gatherings online.

Every month, a group of six to 10 grandmothers, recruited through word of mouth, gets together in person at the Sunrise Center, dons masks, and cooks up meals for the participants. One grandma takes charge of each month’s meal and also offers to answer questions about the recipe or culinary tradition. Some participants pick up their meals at the center, while others have volunteers deliver them.","I’m standing up for okra!”This virtual dinner party is part of a Portland, Oregon-based program called Grandma’s Hands, a platform for Black grandmothers to share family recipes and food traditions with future generations.

Mississippi is one of just three states without a tax break on groceries — a choice that directly contributes to suppressed economic opportunities for grocers, farmers and their employees; the most severe hunger epidemic in the nation; and costly public health consequences.

In short, our sales tax on groceries is financially and morally irresponsible, and it must go.

Eating is necessary for survival, yet satisfying this basic human need takes a bigger bite out of the household budgets of low-income families than wealthier ones. This is especially true in Mississippi, where one in five Mississippians and one in four children statewide lack adequate access to safe and nutritious food — the highest hunger rates in the U.S.

In 2017, our 7% sales tax on groceries cost an average-sized household an average of $604 based on average meal costs statewide. With less to spend on groceries, low-income Mississippians cannot afford fresh and nutritious food options. Instead, they are forced to turn to low-cost and unhealthy alternatives that contribute to high rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and infant mortality.

With policies like the grocery tax in place, it is no wonder that hunger cost Mississippi’s health care system an estimated $1.08–2.22 billion in 2015 alone.

By reducing consumers’ food purchasing power by hundreds of dollars each year, the grocery tax hurts economic opportunities and earnings for Mississippi’s grocers and other food retailers, farmers, and their employees. Past research on grocery taxes across the U.S. illustrate these financial harms.

For example, a 2015 study found that even when compared to an alternative income tax that would produce an equal amount of state revenue, Kansas’ sales tax on groceries reduced rural grocery stores' economic output, decreased employment opportunities, and lowered wages for workers.

A number of studies also suggest that grocery taxes can drive cost-conscious shoppers across state lines to purchase food. Every state that borders Mississippi beats our 7% sales tax on groceries.

Like the vast majority of states, Louisiana exempts groceries from its state sales tax.

Arkansas taxes groceries at less than 1%.

Alabama and Tennessee tax groceries at 4%.

Mississippi’s regressive grocery tax policy may cost grocers, food retailers, farmers, and their employees in Mississippi’s 33 border counties significant economic opportunities.

Mississippians overwhelmingly support grocery tax reform. An April 2019 Millsaps College/Chism Strategies poll found that 69% of voters believe that Mississippi should change how it taxes groceries. Will newly elected and returning lawmakers in 2020 answer their rallying cry for change?

By Patrilie Hernandez, MS

It was almost one in the morning when I ended my shift as the hostess of an upscale Latin American restaurant in downtown St. Louis city when I got a glimpse of something I will always carry with me; a small group of young Black men gathered around a trash dumpster, chuckling amongst each other as I exited the restaurant through the kitchen’s back door into the employee parking lot. The first thing I noticed about them was their unkempt clothes, so my immediate assumption was that they were experiencing homelessness. Some were smoking cigarettes while others picked through the discarded food that had been dumped by the nearby restaurants after the dinner rush a few hours before.

One of the men quickly mumbled something towards me as I made my way towards my car (probably asking for some change) but the rest of the group ignored my presence as I unlocked the door, sat in the driver’s seat, put on my seatbelt, and turned on the car engine.

The reason I will always remember these few moments is that they stirred up so many unexpected feelings that I ended up spending many years trying to sort them out.

The main feeling was confusion. Why did seeing them dig through a dumpster for food surprise me so much? As the daughter of young, working-class Puerto Rican parents living in the South Bronx and other parts of New York City during the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had seen my fair share of hungry addicts asking my parents for money or something to eat outside of our apartment building or the subway.

When we moved into the suburbs some years later, we would often go into the city to visit extended family and I vividly remember seeing similarly unkempt people lined up outside of homeless shelters or under bridges as we would drive by on our way through Queens, to the lower east side of Manhattan, before we entered the Holland Tunnel to cross the river to “safety,” otherwise known as northern New Jersey. As hard as my parents tried to move farther and farther away from the face of poverty (both literally and figuratively), I never forgot what people that were chronically “hungry” looked like: people that had no clue where their next meal was coming from, people that would eat as much as they could when they could, because food for tomorrow was never guaranteed.

Sitting there in my car, I was thinking about how just a few hundred feet away and just a few hours ago, it was common for customers to wine and dine their paychecks away on steaks, ceviche, and cocktails while we (the servers and front of house staff who depended on decent tips to pay rent) catered to their every request and food allergy. Meanwhile, a few hundred feet away in the opposite direction, the nonprofit housing organization next door had their own daily food lines; serving meals nowhere near as decadent to predominantly Black folks that had been pushed out of this neighborhood by “urban renewal” the decade prior.

A wave of anger and sadness then started to sink in.

During the first few years of my life, my parents used SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps or EBT) and WIC and I was on SNAP for a good part of my 20s. So it’s safe to say I knew how it felt not to make enough money to put food on the table. But it had never really dawned on me that in a country where we produce and throw away more food than nearly a dozen developing nations combined, whether you were truly hungry (or food insecure) was never really a matter of proximity to the nearest grocery store, farmers market, or restaurant, but a matter of proximity to power. I realized there in that parking lot that I was occupying a food landscape with vastly different realities depending on your socio-economic class (the one you were most likely born into) and the shade of your skin.

I wish I could say sitting in my car on that cold winter night in 2007 jolted me into the right side of fighting for a racially just food system. The truth is, even as a mixed-race, working-class Puerto Rican (albeit with light skin privilege), I was still complicit in perpetuating problematic, particularly anti-Black behaviors and ideas around the health and social disparities experienced by urban, low-income BIPOC communities.

It wasn’t until I was confronted with my own internalized anti-Blackness and anti-Indigeneity (manifested through my family’s aversion to our own Afro-Indigenous roots, my deeply dysfunctional relationship with food and my body, and ultimately, an eating disorder diagnosis), that I began to come to terms with the role that white toxicity and colonization plays in how I thought about food insecurity and food access.

The Civil Rights Movement and Hunger in America

We can’t talk about the politics of food insecurity in the United States without talking about systemic racism. At first glance, the magnitude of the issue seemed to enter the public eye on the heels of the Civil Rights Movement, when Senators Bobby Kennedy and Joseph Clark toured the Mississippi Delta for the 1968 CBS television documentary, Hunger in America.

While many historians and academics are quick to assert that the documentary was the first to highlight food insecurity in the United States, Dr. Laurie Green, author of the book “The Discovery of Hunger in America: The Politics of Race, Hunger, and Poverty, 1967-1977”, contends that Black and Indigenous civil rights activists were the true force behind the federal response. The 1967 hearings held in Jackson, Mississippi by the Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Manpower, and Poverty centered the testimonies of voting rights activists and labor activists on the negative impacts of food insecurity, not only on the physical body but also on brain development and mental health. Another important part of this movement were the successful breakfast programs founded by the Black Panthers (that the federal government later adopted after criminalizing the Black Panthers). Initiatives by those centering Black liberation were the real heroes behind pressuring the federal government to fund programs and projects to address food insecurity in the US.

But this history was never shared with me in the ten years I spent in predominantly white-led food justice and advocacy circles. Past and current Black and Indigenous food sovereignty efforts were rarely centered; many nonprofits and food banks would love to pitch ideas like subsidized voucher programs for farmers markets or corporate food drives where employees would be incentivized to donate the dusty canned and shelf-stable items that sat in the back of their cupboards as primary ways to address food insecurity. Additionally, “healthy eating” and cooking education programs for these communities would be touted as the key that would make these efforts even more successful. It was common for these institutions to recruit and send white or white-adjacent individuals (like myself) into low income Black and brown communities to conduct “mission” oriented work, and implement programming derived from the deficiency-based, “white man’s burden model” more commonly known as “the white savior complex.”

For the majority of my career, I volunteered/worked for organizations that maintained the idea that neighborhoods with concentrated areas of Black and Indigenous people living in poverty are lacking or broken, and that we were here to “fix” their lives. For many years, I chose to exploit my proximity to whiteness as a way to justify entering “underserved” or “under-resourced” communities as a cooking instructor or nutrition educator in order to “save them from themselves.” The reality, however, is that I was a part of a rotating cast of privileged outsiders who would show up at schools or local recreation centers attempting to relate to the program participants for a short period of time, and then move on when grant or program funding ceased. What it took me a long time to realize is that I was often causing more psychological harm and trauma to the children and communities than if I had never entered their lives in the first place. Not only that, but I was also projecting my disordered body beliefs and food behaviors onto children and families that looked up to me because of my professional expertise and nutrition degree.

The “Obesity Epidemic”: Food Policing and Fat Phobia

About two years after Michelle Obama revealed her “Let’s Move” campaign in 2008, I was already part of a larger food justice community eager to partner with “anti-obesity” programs that aimed to tackle the “Hunger Obesity Paradox.”

This “paradox” was first introduced in 1995 after a leading pediatrician published a report suggesting a relationship between food insecurity and “obesity.” This report seemed to provide “evidence” validating the argument that lack of “healthy” food choices resulted in higher weight status among food insecure individuals, thus explaining their poor health outcomes. Of course, there was no mention of how medical neglect and discrimination due to classism and racism negatively affect health more than individual health behaviors, which has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A few years after this report was published, a panel of NIH tapped medical experts lowered the BMI cutoff for the “overweight” category from 27 to 25 (reportedly because it was easier to remember) thus making millions of people suddenly “overweight.” As overweight and obesity rates literally grew overnight, the fear-mongering behind the dangers of a possible “obesity epidemic” was thrust into the spotlight by media outlets and an already fatphobic medical field.

Nonprofits and policy experts leveraged these headlines and studies over the next decade in an effort to bring attention to the ways that not having reliable and affordable access to a variety of food on a consistent basis did, in fact, harm health. Even if this implicated body size as the primary driver of health, which many know is not the case.

Still, many food justice activists and advocates were adamantly convinced that poor people suffering from food insecurity also often lived in fat bodies because: 1.) they didn’t know how to prepare healthy meals on a limited budget, 2.) they made unhealthy food choices and were too lazy to exercise, or 3.) they were simply unfamiliar with healthy food because of the lack of high-quality grocery chains in the area.

But thinking that food insecure individuals mainly experience poor health because they make “unhealthy”, “uneducated” or “irresponsible” decisions about what they eat, and not about the larger systems of oppression that impede equitable access to health services and care, is rooted in white toxicity and colonization.

Dr. Ashante Reese, food anthropologist and author of “Black Food Geographies: Race, Self Reliance, and Food Access in Washington D.C.” says these widely-circulated beliefs result in a narrative that “African Americans and other people of color are reduced to bodies that need to be regulated and changed” and efforts that focus solely on individual behavior changes as the solution only further perpetuate the idea that “Black people need fixing.”

What we consistently see is that poor people experiencing food insecurity are more likely to be publicly shamed for their food choices, their body shape, and weight. We also see the same food moralizing, food policing, and fatphobia sustained through proposed policies like SNAP restrictions, Soda Taxes, initiatives like Healthy Corner Stores, Produce Prescription programs, and community nutrition programs that are very often led by white women unloading their fatphobic and healthist ideology on women of color.

What these programs and policies actually do is further marginalize low-income Black, brown, Latinx women and mothers, who are often forced to restrict their own food intake and sacrifice their own ability to properly nourish themselves in order to make sure their children have enough food to eat. There is a questionable level of hypocrisy in suggesting (and even promoting) that women of color who are already experiencing food insecurity should restrict or modify their food intake even more in order to lose weight or avoid gaining weight.

There is an abundance of evidence that our food system is steeped in white supremacy, systemic oppression, and colonialist ideology. Food justice/food access activists and advocates should be asking ourselves if we are equally as committed to examining how we are internalizing harmful, especially anti-Black narratives around food choice, interrogating what is deemed “healthy” by dominant, white supremacist power structures, and asserting that our worth is not reflected by the shape and size of our body.

The time needed to travel to stores to access healthy food can be a burden for many families, particularly in rural areas and urban areas located in food deserts. This problem is further exacerbated in tribal communities where the healthy food options can be limited and travel requirements to access stores with a variety of healthy foods are significant.

An evaluation by the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (ITCA WIC) found that by setting travel distance goals for healthy food access to nearest authorized stores they could evaluate the overall efficiency of their store network and recommend new stores that would reduce travel-related costs to WIC participants. The travel distance objective identified by ITCA WIC for urban and non-urban areas (as designated by the US Census 2010) was one and five miles, respectively.

Using these service area objectives, ITCA WIC found that in 2014, the store network served 39% and 66% of urban and non-urban clients, respectively. With the strategic addition of eight new authorized stores in 2016, the service area improved to 41% and 74% for urban and non-urban areas, respectively. Overall travel time was reduced by 15 minutes for WIC participants who lived more than 10 miles from the nearest store.

The study, “A Spatial Evaluation of Healthy Food Access: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants,” mapped 11,000 ITCA WIC participants from 2014, and 12,000 ITCA WIC participants from 2016, with authorized stores and nearby potential stores. The study was published in September 2019 in a special supplement issue of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice (JPHMP), highlighting the work of Tribal Epidemiology Centers.

Dr. Ritchey, ITCA Tribal Epidemiology Center (TEC) Director noted that, “In public health practice, we know that access to healthy food is largely reliant on built environments where individuals work, live, and spend leisure time. The inability to access healthy foods can lead to adverse childhood health consequences, including obesity and nutrient deficiencies, and increased the risk of chronic diseases later in life.”

“The ITCA WIC program is instrumental in supporting clients with access to breastfeeding support, improved household food security status, and children within WIC programs have been shown to have higher academic achievement than low income children not in the WIC program,” says ITCA Assistant Director, Travis Lane. “Our ITCA program serves both Tribal and non-Tribal members in Arizona in an effort to improve health for all.”

“Seeing where our participants are located in relation to our current authorized stores is a considerable asset in identifying areas for improvement within our service areas,” said Jonathan Davis, GIS Analyst for ITCA TEC. “By repeating this analysis, we can see if our clients are moving and can adjust our service network to continue to best meet their needs.”

Dr. Pijawka, Arizona State University, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning Professor added, “Geospatial analysis provides critical decision support and insight, which allows us to see the impact a single store has on the whole service network. Even if a potential store doesn’t improve the service area, we can see if it can reduce the travel burden for our participants.”

Mindy Jossefides, ITCA WIC Director, noted that “This work shows us that we are successful in meeting the vast majority of WIC clients’ shopping needs, while challenging us to work to improve access to stores, which will ultimately improve their nutrient intake and health.”

Mallory Phelps, ITCA WIC Vendor Manager, related that “This study has greatly assisted our program in maximizing our resources to strategically serve our communities.”

This evaluation framework uses secondary data, and is a cost-effective method to evaluate WIC participant access to stores with healthy food. Authorizing additional stores for WIC improves overall population access to healthy foods beyond those that are WIC eligible. This is particularly important in remote and rural areas where stores may be less inclined to serve a variety of fresh produce and dairy products if they were not required to do so in order to comply with WIC requirements. Authorizing only needed stores ensures that WIC state agency resources are utilized effectively and efficiently. Reducing travel distances and travel times for WIC participants reduces stress and commuting expenses that can be used for other important items.

The travel distance objective identified by ITCA WIC for urban and non-urban areas (as designated by the US Census 2010) was one and five miles, respectively.
Using these service area objectives, ITCA WIC found that in 2014, the store network served 39% and 66% of urban and non-urban clients, respectively.
The study, “A Spatial Evaluation of Healthy Food Access: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants,” mapped 11,000 ITCA WIC participants from 2014, and 12,000 ITCA WIC participants from 2016, with authorized stores and nearby potential stores.

The 120 Morgan Ave. location offers nutritious food, professional clothing, toiletries and other basic items free of charge to MSU students. Students only need to present their current MSU I.D. to access these resources.

Regular operating hours are 1-6 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

“Bully’s Closet and Pantry really speaks to who we are at Mississippi State,” said MSU President Mark E. Keenum. “As Bulldogs, we look out for, care for and love one another. That’s what makes this university so special. I thank all who have had a role in making this wonderful facility a reality for our students.”

MSU Vice President for Student Affairs Regina Young Hyatt thanked multiple campus and community organizations for contributing their time, energy and resources to this “wonderful gift for our students.”

“When I mentioned the idea of a food pantry to President Keenum, he had a few simple words for me—make it happen. From idea to reality, it took a lot of hands,” she said. “We are grateful for our student body leaders and university partners, including our colleagues in the food science, nutrition and health promotion department who are conducting research here at Mississippi State, so we can understand more about food insecurity.”

Hyatt recognized external university partners United Way of Central Mississippi and Extra Table, both providing pantry food every month. She also expressed particular appreciation for Montelleo Hobley, behavioral intervention team coordinator in the MSU Dean of Students’ Office, whose “leadership and countless hours organizing, promoting, stocking and cleaning helped make Bully’s Closet and Pantry come to life.”

73,"Sep 15, 2020",Civil Eats,Connecting Fishermen with Hungry Communities Can also Benefit Local Food Systems,"While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw. Tribal members were living in campers and RVs with no electricity and a single hose for running water. Meant to be temporary, these “in-lieu fishing communities” were created in the 1950s when the federal government-built dams that forced tribal members to leave their ancestral fishing grounds.

It was like “being in a homeless shelter, without the infrastructure,” said Rodrigo, who is part Mohawk, a member of the Native American Committee of the American Bar Association, and legal and operations director for We Do Better Relief.

Rodrigo was handing out food boxes as part of a pandemic relief effort led by a new Pacific Northwest coalition called The Wave. Efforts started earlier that day at an event in Cascade Locks, Oregon, in collaboration with the Columbia River Inter-tribal Fish Commission and other groups, before moving out to the in-lieu fishing communities. The event focused on tribal members but was open to the public.

Rodrigo brought 850 pounds of fresh-frozen Alaskan lingcod, a type of groundfish, to provide alongside U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Boxes provided by the Oregon Food Bank. The Wave also provided a food truck, KOi Fusion, that served 400 free teriyaki fish rice bowls, cooked with more of the lingcod.

A partnership with the community-supported fishery (CSF) Alaskans Own, the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, and the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association, the Wave’s fish donation program involves a slew of Northwest food security groups, tribal organizations, chefs, food trucks, and seafood groups. The groups received funding from a nonprofit accelerator group, Multiplier, to purchase 130,000 pounds of fish from small boat, Alaskan fishermen to provide to food-insecure communities in Washington and Oregon.

While the program focuses on rural, and/or predominantly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), communities, it’s recently pivoted to feeding firefighters and evacuees as deadly wildfires sweep Oregon. Getting seafood—or, truly, any fresh and healthy food—to communities like those in-lieu settlements in Oregon and Washington poses additional challenges, but those are precisely what these partners aim to solve.

The partnership is one of six U.S. fish donation programs funded by Multiplier through its Catch Together program, which supports community-based fishermen. At its core, Catch Together’s grant program aims to provide fishermen a living wage to help feed food insecure families a highly nutritious, lean protein—locally caught seafood—that is rarely, if ever, included in food relief efforts.

“My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

But the fishermen groups it supports, from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, view the program as a bigger opportunity to reconnect local fishermen with their communities, at a time when many feel disconnected by global markets that whisk their catch from the dock to far-flung corners of the world. And they seek to leverage the grant funds to overcome barriers that have made it difficult to integrate their sustainably harvested catch into local and regional food systems.

“All of these different organizations and fishermen, they’re really getting excited about . . . how do we get a little bit closer to the people we’re feeding, and how do we support our communities,” said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, one of the grantees. “My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

Shoring Up Fishing Communities

Prices paid fishermen have plummeted everywhere during the pandemic as restaurants have closed or scaled back services. Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, for example, is selling for half the price fishermen were paid in 2019, according to Elizabeth Herendeen of Alaskans Own.

The Catch Together funding allows the groups to buy sustainably harvested fish and pay fishermen a stable price to keep them fishing at a time when one in eight households don’t have enough food to eat. In some cases, as with the lingcod fishermen in Alaska, the grant funds have tipped the balance: Without that funding, the fishermen wouldn’t have been able to go out fishing.

Catch Together encourages its grantees to use its funding as seed money to help them achieve longer term goals to shore up their resiliency—such as by creating a sustainable value-added product, like a fish cake or fish soup, that they can eventually market or get the USDA to purchase for one of its national food assistance programs.

“Our hope is that they’re able to use our grants to create a runway to a sustainable product, or think through how they can serve underserved parts of the community,” Paul Parker, Catch Together’s managing partner and president, told Civil Eats.

Describing Catch Together as a “hub in the middle,” Parker said it’s “uplifting to watch all the different fishing communities come up with ideas about how to serve this need, and then building the programming and cross-pollinating to one another.”

Figuring out the food donation piece can be challenging, however. First the groups need to select the species and harvest the fish, which isn’t always easy. Then they need to turn the fish into a product that’s readily usable by food assistance programs, which can also be tricky: Some programs don’t want seafood because their clients aren’t accustomed to eating it. Last, they need to work out the logistics of the distribution.

“Most of the organizations of fishermen we’re working with have deep experience in one or two of those areas, but not all three,” said Parker.

That’s why Alaskans Own and the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, which received a grant to harvest lingcod and sablefish, teamed up with the Wave, said Herendeen. “We knew the Wave had the structure in place to help move the fish to families in need.”

Reaching In-Lieu Fishing Communities

The Wave program aims to feed more than 600,000 people in rural and BIPOC communities through early November with a combination of hot meals and fresh-frozen fillets, and it piggybacks off the efforts of other food relief organizations. That means “things change on the daily,” notes Keri Johns, a manager at The Wave.","While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw.

74,"Aug 14, 2018",The Hechinger Report,"At more than 25 percent, Mississippi’s food hardship rate highest in nation","In a 12-month period in 2016-17, more than one of every four Mississippi households with children — 25.8 percent — lacked enough money to buy the food they needed, according to a new report by the Food Research & Action Center. That rate is the highest of any state in the nation, and over 7 percentage points higher than the 2017 national average.

At 19.7 percent, Mississippi’s food hardship rate for households without children is the second highest in the nation; only Louisiana, at 19.8 percent, has a higher rate.

The Jackson metropolitan area ranked fourth out of 108 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, with more than 21 percent of households reporting an inability to afford enough food. That rate is nearly the same as the 20.8 percent of people who live in poverty state-wide.

Research shows that when children lack access to food, they are more likely to have poor health, lag developmentally, exhibit negative behavior, and suffer anxiety or depression. These negative effects can, in turn, lead to poor academic performance.

Mississippi’s overall food shortage rate has dropped since 2008 when it hit a high of over 27 percent for all households. Nationwide, the rate of food hardship has dropped from nearly 18 percent in 2008 to just over 15 percent in 2016. The southeast and southwest regions experienced the highest rates of food shortage between 2008 and 2017.

Mississippi not only has the nation’s highest food hardship rate, it also struggles to provide summer and afterschool meals to kids who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch during the school year.

To improve access to food, the authors of the food hardship report say more jobs and higher wages are essential, as well as improved government income-support programs for struggling families. The authors encourage states, local governments and nonprofits to collaborate to enroll more families in federal nutrition programs.","At 19.7 percent, Mississippi’s food hardship rate for households without children is the second highest in the nation; only Louisiana, at 19.8 percent, has a higher rate.

75,"Nov 30, 2019",NBC News,Trump administration proposals could cause millions to lose food stamps,"Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

Over the past year, the Department of Agriculture proposed three changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. The new rules create stricter work requirements for program eligibility, cap deductions for utility allowances and “reform” the way 40 states automatically enroll families into SNAP when they receive other forms of federal aid.

A study by the Urban Institute released this week examined the three rules in combination for the first time and found that 3.7 million fewer people would receive SNAP in an average month, 2.2 million households would see their average monthly benefits drop by $127, more than 3 million others would see an average drop of $37 per month, and 982,000 students would lose access to free or reduced lunches.

“What we found is that overall the three proposed changes would reduce the number of households participating in SNAP by about 11 percent if this was implemented in 2018,"" said Laura Wheaton, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who conducted the study. ""It’s about a 9.4 percent reduction in the number of people participating and about an 8 percent reduction in overall benefits.”

Critics and experts say that would be antithetical to the program's goals to address food insecurity in the United States.

Craig Gundersen, an agricultural and consumer economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has studied the program for more than two decades, said that about a million people could become food-insecure because of the change. He added that 50 percent of those 3.7 million SNAP beneficiaries were already food insecure despite the assistance.

The changes, he said, would put many Americans in a worse position, increasing hunger and health issues. Each additional adult who becomes food-insecure sees an additional $2,000 in healthcare costs, Gundersen explained.

""The essential goal of the program is to mitigate hunger and its consequences in the United States,” he said. ""Anything that impedes SNAP of doing that is very problematic as it leads to food insecurity in our country.""

The USDA, meanwhile, estimates that the changes would reduce the SNAP budget by about $4.2 billion.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the work requirements in a USA Today column, emphasizing that it would save taxpayer dollars.

“At USDA, our informal motto is ‘Do Right and Feed Everyone,’” Perdue wrote. “With these proposed improvements, we will ‘do right’ by the taxpayers and restore the dignity of work to the able-bodied who receive SNAP benefits. And, we will ‘feed everyone’ by ensuring the health and stability of SNAP for those who truly need it.”

All of the new rules have gone through a comment period with the changes to utilities currently taking feedback until Monday. Tens of thousands of people have already responded, with most providing negative responses.

The latest rule change proposed by the Trump administration would cause millions of people to take smaller deductions for shelter and utility costs, which are considered when a person applies for SNAP benefits. Critics say that would force people to choose between buying food and paying for housing.

Gundersen said this change will prove to be a major cost for those living in metropolitan areas with high living costs.

It could also create a steeper financial cliff for some beneficiaries. Those in danger of losing access to SNAP might be discouraged from working because the new calculation would put them in a higher income bracket, causing them to lose access, Gundersen explained

“On the one hand they want to encourage people to work, but on the other they would be taking away that incentive,” Gundersen said.

But the main issue is that SNAP is not intended to be a work program in the first place, Gundersen said, but is instead intended to address food insecurity within the United States.

As it operates now, SNAP does not discourage people from participating in the labor market, he said.

""There are some assistance programs that do discourage people to work, but this is not one of them,"" Gundersen said, adding that what lawmakers should be asking is: ""What makes this program work so well and why does it work well as compared to other programs?""

These new rules also have advocates in states like Nevada worried. Nevada could see up to 22 percent of recipients lose access to food stamps, which could be devastating in a place where 12.3 percent of households face food insecurity, according to the USDA.

“SNAP is related to hunger and getting people the nutrition they need,” said Jocelyn Lantrip, the communications director at Food Bank of Northern Nevada. “Food shouldn’t be a luxury.”

With a tech boom raising income levels but not enough to cover rising housing costs, Lantrip said that these changes could create further food insecurity issues, which remain close to the levels that the Food Bank of Northern Nevada saw during the recession.

At the height of the recession, Lantrip said her food bank helped 103,000 people per month. Now, during a period of perceived economic stability, she said they are helping 91,000.

Food banks like hers wouldn’t be able to accommodate for the needs of an additional 196,000 people, which is the number in Nevada who would likely need help accessing food if these rules were to go into effect, Lantrip said.

“That’s really hard for food banks to keep up with if you have that kind of decline in benefits,” she said. “We support people if they fall outside of the safety net, but we can’t replace the safety net as a food bank. We’re spinning our wheels already, because when unemployment is low people assume hunger is low, but we’re just helping more working poor than before.”","Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

""Within that area, only about 5 percent of those grocery stores supply locally-sourced produce, he said. ""There's about 20 grocery stores in the city. That's about one for every 10,000 people.""

When it comes to assessing a location as food insecure or not, Bartlett said there are a number of factors that come into play.

""It really has a situation of numbers of people, grocery stores, and the amount of fresh produce and nutritious foods that are available in a particular populous. Really, within a food desert only about maybe 23 percent or so of the people have access to fresh produce,"" he added.

Dole decided to first introduce its #SunshingForAll campaign to Jackson due to the city's lack of accessible public transportation, a surplus of fast food establishments, and a median income of just over $35,000, Bartlett said.

While many communities are impacted by a lack of adequate access to healthier food options, Dole is leaning on the public to help the company decide which locations should be next. Bartlett said all people have to do is log on to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter and explain to the company why their location qualifies as a food desert while using the tag #SunshineForAll.

""We're looking forward to expanding this. This is something that is an ability for us to get in and help to spread knowledge and awareness, affordability, accessibility, and also to improve the education of an area about healthy products, nutrition,"" Bartlett said.","The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

The state of Mississippi has long ranked at the bottom when it comes to obesity, with data suggesting that nearly 75 percent of residents in the Magnolia State are overweight.But not everyone is getting a seat at the table. There is also research showing that many people, including children, are living hungry in Mississippi.“I don’t understand how, and why, you know, people go hungry in Jackson,” said Dave Melton, sensei at Melton School of Martial Arts.Feeding America says more than 61,000 people living in Hinds County are food insecure, meaning they can’t afford to consistently feed their families. That’s 25 percent of the county's population.“But in some areas, it’s up to 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent of the residents are dealing with food insecurity,” said Tyson Jackson, program coordinator for Jackson Meals Matter. To make matters worse, a lot of residents live in food deserts, which are in areas without grocery stores.“Growing up in Jackson, there were grocery stores everywhere, and we've seen, again, that economic divestment, and so, when individuals don't have access to sustainable food, healthy fruit, vegetables, meats, dairy products in walking distance of where they live, then that limits their access,” said Dr. Ebony Lumumba, first lady of Jackson.The Jackson Meals Matter program is getting a strong push from Lumumba.“I think our overall goal, to summarize it, is: Make sure that every child in the city of Jackson has access to three meals a day, every day,” Jackson said.“We’re at schools, community centers, churches, community organizations,” Lumumba said. “We simply need people who have the facility to prepare the meals and to serve them to the population. We’re hoping to bring them into the community and not ask the community to come to us.”Lumumba said this is phase one of Jackson Meals Matter. It’s already paying dividends for the children at the Melton School of Martial Arts.“The food is really good, but it’s not enough for some,” Melton said.Melton would like to see the program allow children to take food with them.

78,"Jun 10, 2020",Business Insider,Millions of kids go hungry in the US every summer without school lunches. These striking facts reveal the scale of the problem.,"In the US, 22 million kids get free or reduced-price lunch during the school year.

These school-lunch programs are an important source of food for many children.

But during summer vacation, only 16% of kids who need USDA-funded summer meals are able to access them.

This makes summer the hungriest time of year for lots of children, and it can have long-term consequences.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In the United States, over 11 million children live in food-insecure homes. That term refers to households in which there isn't enough food available for everyone in the family to lead a healthy life, according to national campaign No Kid Hungry.

To support these families, several federal nutrition programs provide assistance: 22 million children rely on free or reduced-price lunch at school, which is funded by the National School Lunch Program.

However, when summer comes around, these meals are often no longer available, which means millions of children don't get fed as they usually would. The USDA and many nonprofits are trying to fill that gap, but the problem hasn't yet been alleviated. School closures due to the coronavirus pandemic put even more children at risk of going hungry.

Here's a glimpse at what happens each summer in the US.

Summer can be the hungriest time of year for kids

Millions of children in the US suffer from hunger and food anxiety during the summer months, since they rely on free or reduced-price meals during the school year.

To address this, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds the Summer Food Service Program, which enables community leaders to establish summer meal delivery sites around the country. Child nutrition programs received an additional $8.8 billion of federal funding this summer to address the pandemic's impact on access to free meals.

However, meals from the summer meals programs only reach only 16% of the children who might need it, according to No Kid Hungry.

One reason for this lack of participation in summer-meals programs is that many families simply aren't aware they exist or don't know how to access them.

Access to summer meals is limited by transportation issues, weather, and other factors

The Summer Food Service Program normally requires children to eat their summer meals on site at the location they're distributed. During the school year, many children rely on school buses for transportation. Without them, it can be difficult for kids to get to summer-meal sites, especially if their parents are working all day.

The requirement to eat summer meals in a group setting has been waived for the summer of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, more meals are being delivered to individual homes. Restrictions around meal deliveries have also been waived.

But about 30% of children who are eligible for free summer meals live in communities that aren't eligible to host meal sites. The program stipulates that summer-meal sites can only be established in areas where at least 50% of children are eligible for free and reduced-price lunches. But poverty exists in economically diverse communities, of course.

There are additional issues that block children in need from accessing nutritious meals. Severe weather can prevent some kids from getting to summer meal sites. Many communities in the US experience dangerously high temperatures, thunderstorms, and other severe weather patterns that can make it difficult for children to get to the sites where meals are served. Some sites are located outdoors, so are particularly affected by weather.

Yet another challenge is that summer-meals programs are temporary in nature, so the sites and all the logistical aspects of running them must be reestablished every summer then dismantled at the start of the school year. This means that sites must re-submit applications every year, renew licenses, recruit staff members, and more. For organizations that have limited resources or small budgets, this can be quite challenging.

The end result of these challenges, according to the nonprofit Children Incorporated, is that there are only 36 summer food programs for every 100 school lunch programs.

Summer hunger can have long-term consequences for health and learning

During summer, families generally have to buy more food than normal because their children spend more time at home. This can strain families' budgets: 43% of low-income families say it's harder to make ends meet in the summer.

On average, a household's grocery costs rise more than $300 a month when school is out, according to No Kid Hungry.

Children who suffer from summer hunger can face more health challenges than their more affluent peers. For instance, many children from low-income families turn to inexpensive, calorie-dense foods during the summer, but those meals lack nutritional value. According to No Kid Hungry, many children who go without school meals during the summer gain weight two to three times faster than their peers during those months. This can lead to higher healthcare expenses for children experiencing obesity.

Additionally, children living in food-insecure homes are more susceptible to chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes , asthma, and heart disease .

Hungry children also are more likely to experience a ""summer slide,"" according to No Kid Hungry. This is when kids forget what they learned during the school year. Over the course of several years, this learning loss can add up and contribute to a significant achievement gap between children from low-income families and children from higher-income families.

Research suggests that as much as 80% of the gap in reading achievement between these groups of students may be attributed to the summer slide.","But during summer vacation, only 16% of kids who need USDA-funded summer meals are able to access them.

79,"Dec 21, 2020",The Counter,Hunger and food insecurity are not the same. Here’s why that matters—and what they mean.,"For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

But that number actually represented the lowest rates of food insecurity in nearly a decade. The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic.

A snapshot assessment led by the U.S. Census Bureau and designed to offer less-comprehensive but more immediate information on the social and economic impacts of Covid, showed that, as recently as the period between November 25 and December 7 (including Thanksgiving), some 27 million adults—13 percent of all adults in the country—reported their household sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat.","For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

80,"Nov 5, 2020",BetaBoston,Study: A million people in Mass. don’t have enough food,"Massachusetts has seen the highest percent increase of residents facing food insecurity of all states, according to new projections released by Feeding America last Friday. The hunger rate in the state has increased 59 percent since 2018, representing more than 1 million people who are now struggling to get enough to eat. The child food-insecurity rate has also worsened, with one in five children in Massachusetts now living in food-insecure households, a 102 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 levels. (Norfolk County in Massachusetts has the highest percent change in child food-insecurity in the country, with a 163 percent increase in 2020 versus 2018.)

As the country awaits the returns of the presidential election and any prospects of another economic stimulus bill, one thing has remained consistent amid the pandemic: People in Massachusetts are going hungry. And the problem is only growing.

The overall food insecurity rate in Massachusetts is projected to reach 14.2 percent this year. The highest rates in the United States will be in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, which could each have more than 20 percent of their citizens facing hunger. And California is predicted to have 6.2 million people who are having trouble getting enough to eat, the largest total number of any state in the country.

“The need isn’t going anywhere,” said Catherine Drennan, the director of public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, which served over 600,000 people in September, a 120 percent increase over last year.

November and December are typically some of the busiest months for local food banks, but the combined economic, political, and public health crises facing the Commonwealth will make this year unlike any other, said Drennan. She said the food bank is planning to provide 20 million meals as part of its annual Hunger Free Holidays campaign.

New issues with a federal food-distribution program have stoked anxieties further among local organizations working to provide food to those in need. Back in May, as part of the CARES Act, the USDA launched its $4.5 billion Farmers to Families Food Box program, working with US farmers to purchase and distribute boxes of agricultural products. During the first three rounds of the program, several vendors in New England were awarded eight-week contracts, and each built a network of local distributors to hand out hundreds of thousands of prepacked boxes filled with dairy, meat, and produce.

Many of the boxes ended up being distributed to local nonprofits — like the Brazilian Workers Center in Allston — which are operating outside the established regional food bank networks, having launched or expanded emergency food services as they saw the need in their communities.

“Since COVID-19, we’ve had to repurpose our regular services to meet food insecurity in the community,” said the Brazilian Workers Center’s executive director, Natalicia Tracy. “The Boston food banks weren’t equipped to handle the demand, and we saw a huge increase in need for food in Allston. So the USDA boxes were really critical.” The Brazilian Workers Center now feeds 500 families each week.

But the execution of the food box program has been fraught. Farmers who won contracts and planted crops for the program were left high and dry when they weren’t chosen as vendors in subsequent rounds. In some parts of the country, there were concerns about the nutritional value of the goods included in the boxes. The USDA also faced blowback last month after President Trump required that a signed letter from him be included in each box.

In the agency’s latest funding round announced last Friday, no Massachusetts vendors were awarded contracts. This will likely mean significant delays in getting the next round of local food distributions up and running, leaving partner organizations like Tracy’s scrambling to find sources for food as they head toward Thanksgiving. So earlier this week, she headed back to the store. “We’ve already purchased 1,200 pounds of rice, beans, and pasta, and some produce. We’re still trying to figure out whatever we can get our hands on,” she said.

Those who have been working with the USDA say that the changes will put undue pressure on the Massachusetts food bank system during its busiest season.

“In two weeks these pantries are going to burn through whatever dry goods they have in back stock,"" said Sean Buchanan, the vice president of sales at Costa Fruit and Produce, one of the local distributors whose vendor contract with the USDA was not renewed. He said Costa handed out more than 889,000 food boxes to 400 partners since the program launched, only to have to turn off the faucet for the distributions on Monday.

“It’s a perfect storm for food insecurity,"" he said.

The USDA’s decision also forced produce distributor Katsiroubas Bros. to lay off 40 staff members overnight, said Torry Katsiroubas Stamm, the company’s president. Over the past several months, the Boston-based distributor had set up an elaborate supply chain and partnered with the nonprofit Boston Area Gleaners to deliver more than 10 million pounds of food to nonprofits, public housing sites, and food banks throughout New England, she said. The program has helped keep her business afloat as her restaurant and food service accounts have cut back on orders amid the pandemic.

Now, that supply chain has been upended, and a new company in Long Island, N.Y., has been given the contract and has to start over creating a distribution plan from scratch, she said.

“Our partners have been calling us, and we don’t have anything to tell them,” Katsiroubas said. “They’re panicked."" She said she feels the same level of stress she heard from her customers back in March, “with everyone saying ‘What do we do?' We’re still here, it feels like it’s happening again.”

“Before this program got up and running, we saw a lot of nonprofits that had never moved food or dealt with food moving thousands of boxes or grocery bags a week,” said Dylan Frazier, the director of strategy for the Boston Area Gleaners, which worked as both a vendor and partner with local distributors to make USDA food box deliveries. “We’re telling people you have to call the food bank, we don’t have any food for you,” he said. “People are flipping out. It’s panic mode. There’s still a line of a thousand or two thousand people with no food.”

Food pantry lines have already been getting longer over the past several months at the Salvation Army of Chelsea and East Boston, said Captain Isael Gonzalez, who oversees the emergency food program there. So, having to wait for the USDA program to restart with new vendors from out of state means he’s now struggling to serve the 700 families that seek out his services daily.

“Through the USDA program, we’ve been distributing over 2,100 boxes each week to families out of our office, and the good part is the boxes come prepacked, and there’s no labor on our end,” Gonzales said. “Not having those boxes is going to have a huge impact: It’s more trips to the Greater Boston Food Bank, more relying on local donations from different resources, and a lot of labor intensity on our part too.”

Ultimately, the USDA Food Box program provides just a small percentage of the overall food assistance currently in place in the region. But “we’ll take every food source we can and it’s definitely helpful,” Drennan, of the Greater Boston Food Bank, said. More importantly, she added, the program is set to expire by year’s end, and “unless another stimulus package comes out and they decide to renew, I don’t know what will happen.”

81,"Jan 31, 2019",Mississippi Today,"Clarksdale ‘brought home the bacon,’ and landed a new grocer seen as vital to the Delta town’s economy","CLARKSDALE – Like many rural Delta towns, this community of 16,000 battles with poverty related issues and limited access to fresh high quality foods is a top concern for many. Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

But, now city officials have announced a new grocer will come into the city, bringing healthy, fresh eats to the residents and neighboring counties.

“Last year, if you all remember, we were pulling out our handkerchiefs and saying goodbye to a grocery store player that had been here for decades, and many of us felt that loss,” said Jon Levingston, executive director of the Clarksdale/Coahoma County Chamber of Commerce.

“Today, we got the promise of a new wonderful grocery store, a new choice to buy quality food for our citizens here in Clarksdale. … Every community that is economically and financially sustainable has choices — choices in housing, choices in grocery stores, good jobs … and this is one more piece in an economic puzzle that allows us to create a sustainable, financial platform for Clarksdale.”

Over the past year, citizens feared the town would not secure another grocery store after the departure of Kroger, a primary option for residents. Many were in disbelief upon hearing news of its closing. Kroger officials cited that profits were declining at the Clarksdale store.

But the Kroger here was profitable, said Mayor Chuck Espy, adding that their year-end balance sheet indicated the store produced $17 million in revenue. Rather it was the corporation changing “their business model to depart from rural communities that look like Clarksdale or Third Street in Memphis,” that resulted in store shutting its doors, he said.

“(Places) where there were people who didn’t have a large discretionary dollar, where there was poverty or high minority population, they pulled out of those communities,” said Espy. “I understand from a corporate aspect, they’re looking for higher profit margin … but pulling out of areas that is designated as a food desert is devastating to a community.”

Clarksdale wasn’t the only town to lose its Kroger. Two other stores in Memphis closed. And a host of other Kroger locations have closed within the past year, several media outlets reported.

The closing here has had an economic impact on the city. Sales taxes have plummeted. In just the past four months, sales tax revenue was down $54,000, said Cathy Clark, Clarksdale city clerk. Online shopping and the loss of Kroger are the two primary factors, officials say.

Last year alone, sale tax revenue was down $125,000. But despite the decrease in revenue and declining population, Clarksdale leaders see new developments like Piggly Wiggly, as a way to grow the community, create more jobs, and bring in more revenue.

Dwan “Dee” Brown, economic developer of P3 Group, Inc., announced the building of the new Piggly Wiggly that will create about 75 jobs, at the mayor and board of commissioners January meeting.

Instead of moving into the old Kroger building, Brown, who’s spearheading the $39 million Corey L. Moore Sports and Recreational Complex in Clarksdale, said that Piggly Wiggly will be located at the complex site.

“As mayor, I’ve been in negotiations with three other entities to take over Kroger. Every entity thought the footprint was too large of a grocery chain,” said Espy in a phone call with Mississippi Today. “(Grocery chains are) moving away from big box stores and moving to smaller intimate stores.”

Brown echoed the mayor, adding that after conducting a market study, the results indicated that equipment, such as HVAC systems and coolers, in the former Kroger dated back to 1981 and the newest in 2001. It would be more costly to move out the old equipment, bring in new equipment, upgrade electrical work, among other things, he said.

The closest Piggly Wiggly to Clarksdale is about 38 miles north in Batesville. But unlike other Piggly Wiggly supermarkets, this one will be tailored specifically to Clarksdale’s culture: focusing on the blues.

“The new store will basically be a blues city Piggly Wiggly. It’ll be more than a shopping experience, it’ll be a cultural experience for those who come and visit,” said Brown. “It’ll be designed to capture the culture and heritage of Clarksdale.”

Blues music will not only reach customers ears when they walk in, but the interior design will reflect the blues culture, said Brown.

Aside from the grocery store, other amenities include a fuel center, a loyalty program to tie rewards from shopping to fuel purchases, curbside pickup for groceries, and delivery services to retirement homes and Coahoma Community College students. Brown noted that CCC students can apply for work study jobs at Piggly Wiggly that will be subsidized by the operations, which means revenue from the store will provide additional funds for students to have work study jobs.

Building the store will cost around $4 million and the fuel center will cost around $500,000, said Brown. They are looking to secure new market tax credits for the project. The sports complex along with the Piggly Wiggly will start the building phase in tandem.

If the process goes as planned, Brown said he hopes to break ground on the public infrastructure in May, construct buildings in August, and open around January or February in 2020.

“We have looked at this area for quite some time, and we know that there’s a need for a grocery store here in this area where you don’t have to go out of town and spend three hours round trip out of your day,” said Tim Chaffin, sales manager of Piggly Wiggly in Alabama at the meeting.

“Piggly Wiggly is not a cookie cutter concept. You can’t drop this store in Nashville, Tenn., or Atlanta, Ga., and it have the same feel. …This is an original.”

Chaffin said that a project of this magnitude is not as easy as putting something on a shelf. He said there is a preliminary site plan in place, but this is time consuming due to putting infrastructure in place and building the store.

Piggly Wiggly is a grocery wholesaler who partners with independent owners, operators, and economic developers. This particular store is a partnership between Brown, his partners CORE Construction and Chasm Architecture, and Piggly Wiggly representatives.

Like this rural town, there have been other communities seeking grocery store options. Another small town in Mississippi, Gloster, struggled with getting one for decades. Finally, they were able to bring a Piggly Wiggly to their town.

The issue of limited access to grocery stores is all too common in rural areas across the state. Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Coahoma County, where Clarksdale is located, has one of the highest food insecurity rates in the state at 31 percent, eleven percent above the state average, according to data from Feeding America.

Though many citizens here were ecstatic about a new grocery store coming in, others questioned the location of the store via social media. A Mississippi Today reporter announcement of the store on Facebook, received 120 shares, 96 comments, and 176 reactions.

Residents argued it would be a hassle to get to the Piggly Wiggly location. Brown noted the distance of citizens driving to Piggly Wiggly versus citizens traveling to the former Kroger store is about a mile and a half for both.

Although the announcement came Monday, officials hope to have a ribbon cutting around this time next year.

“I have to say that I can’t pass this opportunity without saying, ‘Mr. mayor, board of commissioners, Tim, Dwan, y’all have really brought home the bacon, haven’t you?” said Levingston.

“They don’t call it Piggly Wiggly for nothing.”","Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

83,"Sep 17, 2019",Mississippi Public Broadcasting,Farmers Markets Bring Together Communities in Mississippi Delta,"Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming. It was founded by former slaves, and agriculture was part of its history from the beginning. But by the mid-1960s, many African Americans in this part of state were starving. It was so bad that then U.S .Senator Robert F. Kennedy traveled to Mississippi to investigate. Fast forward 50 years and food insecurity is still a problem. But as MPB’s Alexandra Watts reports, there’s a program that’s trying to tackle hunger – one fresh vegetable at a time.

It’s a Saturday morning in Mound Bayou, and LeBroderick Woods is making sure everything is in order for the day for the weekly mobile market put on by Delta Fresh Foods Initiative.

“These are some sweet potatoes that are about 89 cents per pound that were picked out at the Alcorn [State University] farm this morning,” Woods, who is the market manager, points out as he walks around the market. “Here is okra that’s about a dollar and 25 cents per pound.”

Shopper Angela Henderson eyes boxes of red and green tomatoes, potatoes and okra. She’s here because her small town does not have a grocery store.

“It helps us a lot to get everything we need in one place,” Henderson said after buying okra for her meal. “It is very economical and very healthy.”

In addition to Mound Bayou, the mobile market sets up in Shelby and Winstonville on alternating weekends. The market is always parked in a central location so people can walk to it.

Woods said the nearest grocery store is nine miles and a highway away.

“It’s been a struggle. Mound Bayou is considered to be a food desert because they’re so far away from your nearest Walmart – you have to go to Clarksdale or Cleveland, and if you don’t have transportation, that can be a big issue,” Woods said. “One of the hugest parts is transportation and getting to the locally grown food or fresh food.”

The options close by are not the healthiest options.

“[There are] no stores. We have a Bob's Express that sells fried chicken. But nobody around here in the Mound Bayou area sells fresh produce,” Tanielle Woods explains.

Woods is a college sophomore and youth ambassador with the market. Today, she is one of three youth ambassadors at the market.

Listen to Tannielle Woods on healthy eating:

“My name is Tanielle Woods, I am a sophomore at Mississippi Delta Community College and my major is physical therapy. I’m young and in college and I thought that maybe eating noodles and fried chicken was okay, but eating healthy is not bad.”

The youth ambassadors help grow the food and work in the market. As Woods describes it, they are there from “seed to consumer.”

“They'll bring the price down [on] the unhealthy things and the healthy things we have to pay an arm and a leg for,” said Samuel Ferguson, another youth ambassador. The market accepts cash, card and SNAP benefits.

“I think it's important for every community to have fresh produce and have it for cheap, affordable prices, so we can get it.”

Price and transportation concerns went into how the market runs. Before starting the market, Delta Fresh Foods Initiative surveyed community members to see what they wanted.

Rachael Carter of Mississippi State University said community engagement offers more to rural markets.

“In rural communities when they don't have those options of grocery stores, a market can come in and set up wherever they want to have it in the community,” Carter said. “You can put it where people can walk to the market [and] provide a variety of farm produced products. That’s a wonderful thing for a community that just lost a grocery store.”

In Bolivar County, more than one in four people don’t have reliable access to quality food. In Mississippi, around 16 percent of households are food insecure – and the state ranks second in the nation. Many of the most food insecure regions are in the Mississippi Delta.

A United States Department of Agriculture study found that food insecurity is associated with ten chronic diseases. According to County Health Rankings, Bolivar County’s quality of life ranks 72 out 81 Mississippi counties.

Down the road from the market is The Delta Health Center, which opened in the mid 1960s and was one of the first of its kind in the country. According to Out in the Rural: A Health Center in Mississippi and its War on Poverty by Thomas J. Ward Jr., current issues like transportation and health were prevalent in Bolivar County and the Delta years ago.

David Holben, a professor and director of Food and Nutrition Studies at the University of Mississippi, said these health issues still exist.

“I think people equate the health problems we have in our state and nation to over-nutrition and access to too much food,” Holben said. “When in reality, it might be [that] we have access to high fat and high sugar food that tastes good, and yet are lacking nutrients.”



But Holben said having farmers markets can benefit communities.

“So farmers markets do definitely increase access to healthy food available in rural communities,” Holben said. “They do play a crucial role in people having access to fresh and healthy food in their local area. We’re really talking about a local food system.”

“When farmers markets are in communities and people are using it, there is a health benefit in terms of improved diet,” Darcy Freedman of Case Western Reserve University said. But she also notes farmers markets is not a sole health solution.

“It’s going to be a compilation of many factors that are overall making healthy foods more affordable [and] making them more available in addition to other things like promoting walkability and economic opportunity.”

Back at the market, Henry Herman stands near a red wheelbarrow loaded with green watermelon. Herman had a stroke a few years ago, and said he’s learned about the importance of healthy eating.

“If you get healthy food like it was back in the day, I guarantee there would be a lot less people dying or having health problems,” Herman said.

Larry Haywood also stops by the market. He’s a local grower who is helping the youth ambassadors growing the food.

He, too, has had health issues and says there is a power in eating better.

“You don’t realize that until you start eating healthier...and you realize how to eat to live rather than live to eat,” Haywood said.

LeBroderick Woods on what a ""Good Food Revolution"" Means:



""Because it’s a change. It’s a paradigm change -- it’s a paradigm change for the community. We’ve gotten so stuck on instant gratification – your Big Macs, your quick meals and things of that nature. We’ve kind of gotten away from things we were raised on – the fresh produce and grandmama’s cooking and things of that nature. So good food is not just good tasting, it’s good for the spirit. It’s good overall. It build character even if you will.""

Right now, the market is only in Mound Bayou once every three weeks, but LeBroderick Woods wants to see it expand.

“I hope it grows to us having our own market here, and it being a consistent thing throughout the week -- not just a Saturday event,” says Woods, who comes back every week to his hometown. That it’s something that can be prominent and it lasts through seasons – summer, winter, fall all of the above. That it’s our own Walmart or grocery store here in Mound Bayou.”

Delta Fresh Foods Initiative hopes customers walk away with more than just fresh produce. The organization wants them to learn how to live and eat healthier.","Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming.

84,"May 20, 2020",PRNewswire,Feeding America Study Projects Local Food Insecurity Rates Amid Pandemic Could Reach Up To 1 In 3 Adults And 1 In 2 Children,"CHICAGO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will have a devastating impact on people facing hunger across communities nationwide, according to a new study by Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization. This study is the first of its kind to explore how food insecurity rates at the local level may increase in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity analyzes food insecurity rates for the overall population and children by state, county and congressional district. According to the study, communities that had higher rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will continue to struggle more than other areas. Meanwhile, communities with lower rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will tend to see the largest relative increases in food insecurity as a result of the crisis.

Pre-pandemic – and according to the USDA's most recent report on food security in the U.S. – 37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life. However, a recent Feeding America analysis demonstrates that this number is likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children. That means approximately 54 million people (1 in 6 people) may experience food insecurity in 2020, including 18 million children (1 in 4 children).

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

According to The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, the states projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity among the overall population include Mississippi (24.1 percent), Arkansas (22.5 percent), Alabama (22.2 percent), Louisiana (21.7 percent) and New Mexico (20.7 percent). Meanwhile, the states projected to have the highest rates of child food insecurity include Louisiana (34.5 percent), New Mexico (33.9 percent), Nevada (32.9 percent), Mississippi (32.6 percent) and Alabama (32.4 percent). One in three children in these states will likely experience food insecurity this year.

Specific counties projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity this year are:

Jefferson County, MS (34.2 percent for overall population)

(34.2 percent for overall population) Issaquena County, MS (33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children)

(33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children) East Carrol Parish , LA (33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children)

(33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children) Kusilvak Census Area, AK (33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children)

(33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children) Holmes County, MS (32.7 percent for overall population)

(32.7 percent for overall population) Sabine County, TX (49.1 percent for children)

(49.1 percent for children) Zavala County, TX (48.9 percent for children)

Additionally, the counties that may see the highest change in food insecurity rates for the overall population are:

Burke County, ND (157 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(157 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Renville County, ND (131 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(131 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Dickey County, ND (127 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(127 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Loudoun County, VA (125 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(125 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Eagle County, CO (124 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

""More of our neighbors in these communities and beyond are relying in part on charitable food assistance to make ends meet,"" said Babineaux-Fontenot. ""As a result, food banks are facing a 'perfect storm' of surges in demand, declining food donations, fewer volunteers and disruptions to our operating procedures. Regardless of these challenges, we will continue to stay strong and resilient and work our best to help ensure our neighbors have food on the table.""

This new analysis was conducted by building upon the approach Feeding America used in two earlier briefs to predict changes to national food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to changes to poverty and unemployment. The annual projected unemployment rate (11.5%) is within close range of expert estimates when annualized, including those from a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of more than 60 economists as of May (11.6%), the Congressional Budget Office (11.4%), and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (10.3%). To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national unemployment projection for job loss due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

The underlying analysis for the food insecurity projections was conducted by Dr. Craig Gundersen using the model developed for Map the Meal Gap, Feeding America's county-level food insecurity report.

Other key findings from this report regarding the overall population include:

The projected rate of food insecurity is highest for Mississippi (24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018.

(24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018. North Dakota has the lowest projected rate of food insecurity for 2020 at 12.0 percent. Still, it will see the largest increase in food insecurity rates (77 percent) compared to all other states.

In addition to North Dakota , states that are projected to have the highest change in food insecurity rates – from 2018 to 2020 – include Minnesota (60 percent change), Nevada (57 percent change), Wisconsin (57 percent change) and Hawaii (57 percent change).

Other key findings from this report regarding child food insecurity:

California will see the highest increase in the number of children living in food-insecure households (852,730) bringing the total to 2.2 million. Still, Texas will be home to the most children facing food insecurity (2.3 million).

85,"Oct 29, 2019",Washington Post,What parents should know about how living near fast-food outlets could affect their children,"The obesity figures dropped for every half block farther away that students lived from unhealthy food sources, the researchers found.

AD

Elbel said in a phone interview that the findings showed a new impact of “the potential role of the food environment” on public health.

Since 2007, schools in New York have tracked students’ height and weight. Elbel and his team used mapping software and the city’s restaurant inspection data to compare students’ addresses with their distance from fast-food outlets, corner stores, sit-down restaurants and grocery stores, all selling healthy food and junk food.

AD

The researchers used the inspection data to identify restaurants with counter service, including pizza, Chinese and any other kind of order-at-the-counter takeout.

The researchers were then able to correlate students’ body mass index data with precisely how close they lived to these kinds of restaurants.

AD

The comparisons made were “highly neighborhood specific,” according to the researchers. For example, youths in a small section of Harlem were compared only with other youths in the same part of Harlem.

“It really gets rid of a lot of the confounding data like socioeconomic status,” Elbel said. “We weren’t looking at Upper East Side kids versus Lower East Side kids. We were comparing kids that live in the same small neighborhood to each other. How does living close versus a little bit further away affect kids? There’s something about living within half a block to fast food that’s not great.”

The study, Elbel acknowledged, does not account for the rise of healthier counter-service eateries such as Sweetgreen, but he said that because the data was collected between 2007 and 2013, most of the eateries covered by the study were traditional fast-food restaurants leaning on hamburgers, sandwiches and such.

AD

AD

For Elbel, “food swamps,” or urban areas with a density of fast-food restaurants and corner stores stocked with unhealthy choices, present challenges.

“It’s about supply and demand, the structure of cities and historical zoning issues,” he said. “A bigger question is: What is it about access to these restaurants that’s triggering?”

The study found no increase in obesity risk based on the distance from home to grocery stores and sit-down restaurants. What appears to put youths at risk is how easily and quickly they can access junk food, Elbel said.

He said further research was needed to explore what happens when children pass fast-food outlets on the way to and from school.

AD

There has been a lot of voluntary regulation, he said, with the food industry agreeing to clamp down on advertising to children. But, Elbel said, government bears some responsibility to regulate.

AD

“Policy has been proposed that addresses the density of these kinds of restaurants,” he said. “London had considered restricting fast food around schools. We already limit liquor stores around schools and churches.”

Obesity rates for children have tripled since the 1970s, and experts say a drop of just a few percentage points could save thousands of children from diabetes, heart disease and other health problems.

According to a National Survey of Children’s Health report released this month, obesity rates among youths ages 10 to 17 averaged 15.3 percent nationwide, with a childhood obesity rate of 25.4 percent in Mississippi.

Nationwide, black and Hispanic youths had obesity rates of 22.2 percent and 19 percent respectively, significantly higher than white (11.8 percent) or Asian (7.3 percent) youths.

AD

AD

But the root causes are confounding — how to tweeze out genetic predispositions from lifestyle choices and income — and this muddies what can be done about it.

It has not been all gloomy news for children’s nutrition. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, over the past several years there has been a decline in obesity rates among some children.","The obesity figures dropped for every half block farther away that students lived from unhealthy food sources, the researchers found.

86,"May 1, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Drug felons can now receive food stamps in Mississippi,"CLOSE You hear it all the time, but do you know what SNAP is? Here are 6 things you should know about the program that started during the Great Depression. USA TODAY

As many as 67,000 Mississippians with felony drug convictions could become eligible for federal food assistance after the state Legislature opted out of a federal rule preventing them from receiving the benefits.

The change is part of criminal justice reforms lawmakers passed this year to try to reduce recidivism and prison population.

In 1996, Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. It disqualified people convicted of a state or federal drug felony from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families for life — unless their state legislatures opt out.

When the Mississippi Legislature passed House Bill 1352, the Criminal Justice Reform Act, this year, it opted out the federal ban on SNAP. The change becomes effective July 1.

Mississippi had been one of only three states that still had a full ban on those with a drug conviction that kept them from participating in the programs. The other two states are South Carolina and West Virginia.

Sen. Sally Doty, R-Brookhaven, successfully pushed to add the change to the reform bill.

Doty said eligible SNAP program participants must meet income requirements and either have a job or participate in workforce training or GED classes. But with the ban in place, the education and job training programs were unavailable to those with drug felonies on their records.

""I saw no reason to treat drug felons differently than those with violent offenses,"" Doty said. ""And the ban had a larger effect on women, who generally have lower-paying jobs and could greatly benefit from the education and training programs, as well as the nutritional support. The overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities.""

SNAP provides monthly benefits to help low-income households buy food. The federal program is administered by the Mississippi Department of Human Services.

Department of Human Services staff attorney Dewitt Fortenberry said the agency can’t answer with certainty how many more people will qualify because of the change.

The nonprofit Mississippi Center for Justice said as of 2017, an estimated 67,376 Mississippians who had state drug felony convictions could be affected by the federal SNAP ban at some point in their lives. Based on 2011 figures, an estimated 5,200 women statewide could be impacted by the TANF ban during their lifetimes.

The SNAP program is federally funded. Mississippi receives about $60 million a month in federal funds for the program.

There are limits on income for a family to receive SNAP benefits. The maximum monthly household income limit for a family of four is $2,665 and the maximum amount of SNAP payment would be $640 monthly.

MCJ said lifting the SNAP and TANF drug felony ban in Mississippi would significantly decrease recidivism and lift a lifetime punishment that heightens hunger, unemployment, and economic instability, especially for women and their families.

“One in five Mississippians and one in four children statewide are hungry — the highest in the nation,"" said Kathryn Rehner, an MCJ policy associate. ""Lifting the SNAP/TANF drug felony ban will help put food on the table for thousands of children and families in our state while increasing access to workforce training and helping reentering citizens find work and stability.”

MCJ said women — especially single mothers — are significantly more likely than men to participate in SNAP or TANF during their lifetimes but are also more likely to have a felony for a drug conviction. .

Editor’s note: This article will be continually updated throughout the COVID-19 outbreak and will remain in alphabetical order. Please email elena@foodtank.com if you would like to add an opportunity to our running list.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus, has disrupted most of the world in recent weeks. People are staying home from work, schools and colleges are moving online, and restaurants in many cities and states are mandated to serve eaters via takeout or delivery only. Farmers markets are closing or not opening at all. And, unfortunately, some cafes, bars, and kitchens have closed entirely. Food service workers—from chefs and line cooks to wait staff and dishwashers—are on the front lines of both the health and economic impacts of this disease.

But thankfully, in response, advocates around the country and around the world are gathering community support—and if you’re able, you can help too. These organizations are welcoming donations of food, money, and volunteer hours to aid restaurants, service workers, farmers, and people going hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. ALONE Ireland

With people self-isolating to prevent COVID-19 infections, senior citizens—already particularly vulnerable to the disease—may feel lonelier with limited social contact. ALONE is an Irish organization that recruits volunteers to call, visit, and befriend elderly people living at home. In response to COVID-19, they are looking for more volunteers to offer telephone support, by kindly checking in on those over 60, and practical support, by running errands like grocery shopping and pharmacy pickups. They have also launched a national helpline to answer questions and offer reassurance. People around the world are welcome to donate, and those living in Ireland can volunteer here.

2. ATL Family Meal

As a collaboration of more than 200 restaurants and businesses in the Atlanta area, ATL Family Meal delivers meals to hospitality workers who are facing either unemployment or hunger due to COVID-19. ATL Family Meal has delivered more than 15,000 meals during the pandemic. The initiative’s meal delivery network includes Butcher & Brew, Holeman & Finch, Empire State South, and more. Plus, Wild Heaven Beer, a local craft beer brewery, has created two new beers to support ATL Family Meal and is donating a portion of proceeds to the initiative.

3. Big Table

Operating in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and San Diego, California, Big Table cares for restaurant workers experiencing hardship, poverty, addiction, legal trouble, and more—all of which can be magnified by crises like COVID-19. Big Table works on a referral model, so rather than requiring a person in crisis to ask, Big Table allows a fellow employee or manager to submit a personal referral. You can donate online, or care for vulnerable members of your own community by taking on one of Big Table’s creative support ideas. If you are a food service worker and know someone in crisis, refer them here.

4. Boston Cares

A central hub for volunteering, Boston Cares helps more than 25,000 people annually give back to schools, nonprofit agencies, and other community programs. They recruit, train, and mobilize volunteers across the Greater Boston area. As many civic organizations adjust their programming models in response to COVID-19, Boston Cares is seeking volunteers to help the community. Boston Cares offers a virtual volunteer orientation program so people can begin to help others while maintaining their social distancing.

5. California Food Policy Advocates

With offices in Oakland, Los Angeles, and San Diego, California Food Policy Advocates (CFPA) pushes policy solutions to help low-income people across the state access healthy food. CFPA supported and will help implement national COVID-19 response programs in California, including those enacted by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. CFPA is also using its email newsletter as a way to keep the community informed about advocacy opportunities and policy responses to the coronavirus. You can donate here.

6. Chef Ann Foundation

The Chef Ann Foundation is a Colorado-based nonprofit helping schools around the country serve kids healthier, tastier, scratch-made lunches. As schools respond to coronavirus-related closures, the Chef Ann Foundation is sharing successful tactics and best practices from their partner districts. They’re working to make it as easy as possible to develop remote food programs and other support for students. In addition to accepting donations, the Chef Ann Foundation is also collecting messages for a nationwide Thank You card for school food workers across America.

7. Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE)

Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE) offers support to families of food and beverage service workers facing serious challenges, from serious illness and death to injury or eviction. CORE grants help families with everything they need to weather tough times — medical bills, gas, groceries, clothing, utilities, rent, and more. Since 2004, CORE has supported more than 600 families and raised over $4 million. Currently, CORE is setting aside grants specifically for families of restaurant employees who have tested positive for COVID-19.

8. City Harvest

As restaurants closed and events were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, much of the food that would have been served did not go to waste, thanks to City Harvest. The New York City-based food rescue organization received 50,000 pounds of donated food last week — five times their normal intake — and distributed it to food pantries, soup kitchens, and directly to families in need. Monetary donations to City Harvest will help provide more shelf-stable food relief to people in need and ensure their delivery schedule can meet the increased need.

9. Dining at a Distance

Dining at a Distance, created specifically to support food providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers dozens of local, community-sourced databases of farms and restaurants that remain open for business. Residents of nearly 50 cities of all sizes around the globe, from Berlin to Boston to Corinth, Mississippi, can find contact information for restaurants, takeout and delivery details, and comments from community members. Dining at a Distance also offers databases of farms in all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C., broken down by crop type, organic certification, and how consumers can pick up or receive fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, and more. You can get involved by adding restaurants and farms to the database or starting a new database if your city isn’t listed.

10. Family Agriculture Resource Management Services (F.A.R.M.S.)

Recognizing the systemic challenges and discrimination Black farmers face in the United States, attorney Jillian Hishaw founded Family Agriculture Resource Management Services. F.A.R.M.S. provides legal assistance to farmers with limited resources and helps them retain control and ownership of their land. The Farmers Emergency Fund, which is open to small rural farmers, but not farm employees, is aimed at making sure aging farmers and those from historically disadvantaged groups can stay afloat during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Stipends are limited to $500.

11. The Farmer Fund

Although The Farmer Fund was initially founded to help Georgia farmers facing destruction from natural disasters, “we have seen over the past few days that a pandemic like COVID-19 is its own natural disaster — and is certainly an emergency,” they write. The Farmer Fund, now run by Georgia Organics, has raised over US$50,000 to support farmers in the state since 2018. Now, donations to the fund will help farmers survive the pandemic, rebuild, and continue feeding Georgians through markets, CSAs, and restaurant sales.

12. Farmworker Justice

Through legal advocacy in government, regulatory agencies, and in the court system, Farmworker Justice aims to secure legal rights for agricultural workers and improve their working conditions. With dedicated attorneys on staff, Farmworker Justice represents agricultural workers in lawsuits and regulatory petitions. At the same time, they educate both policymakers and the public about the challenges they face. “All of these workers are in perilous situations and being given absolutely no respect in the narrative of COVID-19,” food activist and journalist Raj Patel told me on Food Talk with Dani Nierenberg.”

13. Feed the Front Line NOLA

In three steps, Feed the Front Line supports restaurants, musicians and artists, and hospital workers caring for those impacted by COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana. First, every donation goes toward ordering meals from local restaurants for ER shift crews. Second, local musicians and artists who have lost out on gigs are hired to pick up the food and deliver it to a local hospital. Third, the talented deliverers drop off the food with a side of morale-boosting “food love.” During the last week of March, Feed the Front Line NOLA fed 1,200 hospital workers with 35 deliveries, putting $10,000 toward local restaurants, musicians, and artists. On Saturday, April 4, alone, they served 1,800 meals. If you want to “send food love,” you can donate online.

14. Float Small Business & Portland Community SOS

Float Small Business and Portland Community SOS are two initiatives in Portland, OR, with similar missions: encouraging community members to support local businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Float Small Business has pages devoted to restaurants & bars, cafes, and grocers & specialty shops, with links to support funds so you can give money directly to restaurants struggling to survive. Portland Community SOS is focused on gift cards, and offers links to the websites of restaurants and cafes that offer them. Portland Community SOS also offers a page of resources for business owners.

15. Food Chain Workers Alliance

By uniting worker-based organizations into a broad coalition, the Food Chain Workers Alliance (FCWA) stands up for more than 375,000 workers who “plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, [by] organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain.” In a survey, the Food Chain Workers Alliance found that 80 percent of all food workers were not given paid sick days, and 43 percent said they feared they would lose their job if they took a sick day. In response to the dangers of COVID-19, the Food Chain Workers Alliance is fighting for the health and safety of workers, fair wages and working conditions, and support for street vendors and undocumented immigrants.

16. Food Recovery Network

Since its inception in 2011, Food Recovery Network has rescued more than 3.2 million pounds of food and has a presence on 230 college campuses across the United States. Food Recovery Network empowers students, communities, and food businesses to reconstruct their perceptions and habits around surplus food. To support businesses making difficult choices in closing or paring down operations, FRN has created a four-step COVID-19 Food Recovery Guide to make donating excess food as simple as possible.

17. Frontline Foods

Hospital workers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, often working day and night treating patients. Meanwhile, local restaurants are struggling financially. Frontline Foods aims to address both issues: With donations processed through Chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen, Frontline Foods pays local restaurants to cook and deliver meals to hospital workers in their community. With 28 chapters in 21 U.S. states, Frontline Foods has raised over US$1 million and delivered more than 7,000 meals during the COVID-19 outbreak.

32. The Power of 10

A new initiative that launched in response to COVID-19, The Power of 10 is a “restaurant revitalization plan” conceived by chef Erik Bruner-Yang. The Power of 10 aims to use one donation to fund restaurants, support employees, and feed food-insecure communities for free. If a restaurant could receive a $10,000 donation, it could re-employ 10 full-time staff and serve 1,000 free meals — hence, the power of 10. The initiative is being piloted at three restaurants in Washington, D.C.: Cane, ABC Pony, and Maketto, which is helmed by Bruner-Yang. The model is coming to Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, and is scalable for any size community across the country. You can make donations in amounts that are, appropriately, powers of 10, starting at US$10.

88,"Mar 24, 2020",Successful Farming,What farmers need to know about COVID-19,"As COVID-19 makes headlines and heightens uncertainty around the country, farmers and others in rural America are looking for answers. The new coronavirus has been disruptive to markets as well as farm families’ lifestyles.

Ag economist David Widmar predicts that the decisions made during the COVID-19 outbreak will be studied for years to come. He says four key sources of uncertainty make this time difficult for agriculture.

Relief for Farmers and Agriculture Industry

Congress allotted $23.5 billion for agriculture in the coronavirus relief package, but ""that amount of money will not sustain"" the farm sector, said Zippy Duvall, American Farm Bureau Federation president.

Markets and Prices

Stock prices have fallen over the last month, and commodity prices have followed.

Economists Brent Gloy and David Widmar explained the outbreak is costing farmers $50 to $90 an acre from the lost corn and soybean revenue that farmers expected this year.

However, market analyst Ray Grabanski says demand for food is going up much faster and more than even the most optimistic food producer expected.

As the virus continues to spread quickly, consumers are stocking up on necessities such as bread, crackers, and pasta. Grabanski says this is why wheat is trading higher than before the virus sell-off occurred on March 21.

Shoppers stockpiling meat has caused wholesale beef prices have jumped to record levels, but the spike in prices isn't helping cattle farmers. Cattle prices have actually declined since January, putting many ranchers in a precarious financial position.

In addition to groceries, live chickens are on some people's panic buying list. Poultry specialist and veterinarian David Frame shares eight important points to consider before purchasing chicks.

READ MORE: Baby chicks are on the panic buy list

Farmers who sell directly to the public or institutions are especially concerned about market closures.

David Newman of Missouri sells 95% of his pork to the restaurant industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. He says demand has still been good as restaurants have moved to take out and delivery options, but the situation has added new logistics challenges.

“Farmers markets are essential activities for the economic livelihood of farmers and for food access for millions of Americans,” says Ben Feldman, executive director of the Farmers Market Coalition. “The closure of markets has the potential to bankrupt farmers and force people to go without food.”

In a recent teleconference about farmland, Mark Dozour, former chief economist of the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M, and Steve Bruere, owner of People's Company, said farmland is holding relatively steady in the wake of COVID-19.

Banking and finance

Low interest rates have been dropped further creating an opportunity for some farmers to refinance. After a phone call and a bit of paperwork with his banker, Indiana farmer Brian Scott is on track to save $100,000 in the next four years by refinancing one farmland loan and his home mortgage.

READ MORE: Why farmers should talk to their banker about refinancing today

The Farm Credit Administration has urged the institutions in its system to work with farmers who have been affected by COVID-19. These institutions may be able to alleviate stress for farmers by extending the terms of loan repayments, restructuring borrowers’ debt obligations, or easing some loan documentation or credit-extension terms of new loans to certain borrowers.

Economist David Whitaker says he expects COVID-19 to be a small shadow compared with the economic downturn to come.

Ethanol

At the beginning of the month, some ethanol producers worldwide said demand was up for their products as people stockpiled hand sanitizer, which can be made from the biofuel.

READ MORE: Ethanol makers see demand surge on hand sanitizer stockpiling

Now, fewer Americans are driving to work, school, and events amid the outbreak. This could have a dramatic negative impact on corn demand by the U.S. ethanol oil industry, says Todd Hubbs of the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois.

Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper confirmed U.S. ethanol producers are on track to shut about 2 billion gallons of annualized output by then end of March because of the slump in demand for fuel.

Supply chains and logistics

COVID-19 is also creating supply chain concerns for farmers around the country. Iowa pig farmer Katherine Marcano-Bell says, “We worry about plants shutting down and us having to keep pigs for a longer period of time.”

Although the plant is not closing, the first confirmed case of a slaughterhouse worker infected with COVID-19 was reported Monday at a Mississippi poultry processing plant.

In a tweet last week, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said, “Food supply is sound, it’s stable & there’s plenty of food available. To the folks working in grocery stores & driving trucks full of products: Y’all are the heroes in the food supply chain.”

Farm labor

Many farm families with school-age children now must juggle childcare along with the usual farm chores. This may require relying on family members who normally work on the farm or are of higher risk for the virus.

For Marcano-Bell, labor issues are top of mind as COVID-19 shutters businesses and schools in the state. Her family does the work on the farm themselves.

The Iowa Department of Public Health has recommended farms and other businesses cross-train and prioritize critical functions.

In 2019 about 180,000 farmworkers from other countries worked in the U.S. under the H-2A program. More than half of all these workers are concetrated in five states and many come to work on large fruit and vegetable farms. Farmers who rely on these seasonal workers are concerned delays caused by COVID-19 will keep workers from arriving on time.

Planting Plans

Economist Todd Hubbs says, ""We'll be swimming in corn"" after farmers indicated they will plant a larger-than-expected 97 million acres of corn. That could produce 15.9 billion bushels of corn, assuming normal weather and yields.

Connectivity

With classes canceled across the country, parents and students are clamoring for educational activities that can be done in isolation. FFA Advisor Alex Rogers recommends a host of online activities for high schoolers interested in animal science, welding, and more while they’re away from school.

READ MORE: Ag students can learn online

While people are working and learning behind their screens at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, people in rural America are having a harder time getting connected.

Although online farm auctions have been a way of business for some companies for years, some farmers are buying equipment online for the first time as the CDC has recommended gatherings of no more than 10 people to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

Farmers’ health

Farmers are proud of being hard working and tough. “It’s not a time for farmers to be that tough guy,” says veterinarian Jim Lowe. “If you get sick, after getting on the tractor to plant, get yourself isolated and don’t infect your family.”

After a tiger at a New York zoo tested positive for the respiratory virus, the USDA says you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with other people.","As COVID-19 makes headlines and heightens uncertainty around the country, farmers and others in rural America are looking for answers.

89,"May 22, 2020",,"Trump’s Food Aid Program Gives Little Funding to the Northeast, Where Coronavirus Hit Hardest","ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

President Donald Trump’s signature food aid program is sending less relief to New York and New England than other parts of the country, even though the Northeast has the most coronavirus cases. Some states — Maine and Alaska at least — have been left out completely so far.

The regional imbalances are an unintended side effect of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s strategy in hiring private contractors to distribute food, the agency said. It is now looking for ways to reach areas that were passed over.

“USDA is evaluating how we might expand access to the program in areas that are underserved,” the agency said in a statement.

Out of $1.2 billion in the program’s first round, just $46 million is going to the Northeast. The region, which encompasses New York and New England, has the most coronavirus cases but received the least money of any region except the Mountain Plains, which has almost half as many people.

Help Us Continue Reporting on COVID-19 Are you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we’re on track. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.

By contrast, the Southwest (including Texas) is getting more than five times as much money even though it has only about 50% more people and a quarter as many coronavirus cases.

Food Aid Funding Is Lowest in the Hardest-Hit Areas In President Donald Trump’s signature food relief program for the coronavirus pandemic, the Northeast — the hardest-hit region — got the least amount of money per confirmed COVID-19 case. Sources: USDA, Johns Hopkins University Isaac Arnsdorf/ProPublica

Put another way, the Northeast has 10% of the country’s population and 33% of COVID-19 cases but is receiving only 4% of food relief dollars, according to ProPublica’s analysis of data from the USDA, the Census Bureau and Johns Hopkins University.

The pandemic is also taking a severe economic toll on New England. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, unemployment claims from March 21 to April 11 equaled 16.6% of the region’s total workforce, and 36% of renters and 18% of homeowners in New England are at risk of being unable to make their payments.

Trump and his daughter Ivanka have personally heralded the USDA’s new program, which is meant to deliver boxes of fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy to food banks, churches and other nonprofits. Instead of using its regular system for buying and distributing food, which typically handles nonperishable items in bulk, the USDA awarded contracts to private distributors.

The process was unusually fast for government contracting: Companies had only a week to apply, and the USDA announced the winners a week later.

Although the USDA announced the contracts on a regional basis, the agency had no method for allocating funding to each region — it just depended on which companies won their bids. “The amounts and locations awarded were based on the offers received and the evaluation of those offers,” the USDA said.

The relative dearth of distributors in the Northeast is making it harder for food banks there to meet the needs of their communities. In Rochester, New York, the Foodlink food bank consulted with dozens of companies that it has worked with about applying for the USDA contracts. But none of those bids were successful, and Foodlink didn’t have a relationship with any of the winning contractors.

Now the food bank is in touch with the winning distributors but has yet to receive any shipments. As a result, it doesn’t have much fresh food to give out, even as the city’s service hotline is getting a surge of calls from people needing food, according to Foodlink’s chief strategy officer, Mitch Gruber.

“We could have had more food sooner, and they could have guaranteed more geographic representation across the nation if the program had been designed around food banks and not around distributors,” Gruber, who’s also a Democratic member of Rochester’s city council, said in an interview. “Everyone’s genuinely trying to best connect surplus at farms with increased need at food banks, and I’m glad the USDA is trying to fill that void. The smartest way to have done it would be to fund the food banks and work backwards to food distributors and vendors to serve them, rather than to have the USDA work with distributors and vendors.”

Read More Wedding Planner, Caterer, “Brand Builder”: Trump’s Food Aid Program Is Paying $100+ Million to Unlicensed Dealers Contractors with no experience in food distribution are looking for suppliers on Facebook while some food banks scramble to find desperately needed deliveries.

Thus far, the USDA has awarded $1.2 billion worth of contracts to distributors, out of $3 billion available overall. The agency said the contracts were competitively evaluated based on the companies’ ability to deliver.

But some of the winning bids raised eyebrows because the companies appeared to lack experience in food distribution or did not have a proper USDA license. At the same time, some applicants with more traditional qualifications said their bids were denied on mistaken grounds.

Three key Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee asked the USDA to explain how it evaluated the bids, including if it checked companies’ licenses and considered equity across regions.

“We share USDA’s goal of providing effective and timely assistance to families, farmers, and food supply businesses like food distributors,” Reps. Stacey Plaskett, Jim Costa and Marcia Fudge said in a letter Friday to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “We are concerned, however, that contracts were awarded to entities with little to no experience in agriculture or food distribution and with little capacity to meet the obligations of their award.”

The USDA defended its selections. “A lot of groups and organizations have some very great abilities that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to assess by looking at the name of the organization,” Greg Ibach, the USDA’s under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. “We feel confident that between our screening process and our audit process that we will be able to assure that those companies will be successful in fulfilling the responsibilities and the design of our program.”

One of the rejected applicants was a local distributor in Maine called Native Maine Produce & Specialty Foods. The USDA told the company its application was missing a signature on a certain page, according to vice president of sales Jimmy Davolio. Davolio said he rechecked the paperwork and the signature was there.

“I don’t know what we could have missed,” Davolio said.

No other companies serving Maine won contracts either, so the state is receiving no food boxes, according to the state Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.

“We were disappointed we didn’t get it, but now I’m more disappointed that the folks in Maine aren’t getting those funds,” Davolio said in an interview. “We bid where we thought we could help. Now I feel terrible.”

The state is sorely missing the relief as food bank demand has tripled in some places, at a statewide average of about 35%, according to Kristen Miale, president of the Auburn-based Good Shepherd Food Bank, which serves a statewide network. Maine’s growers are also hurting and looking for new customers since their primary buyers — restaurants and the food service industry — have been largely shuttered.

“We need to be distributing a lot more food. Our primary constraint is we just don’t have enough food to give out,” Miale said. “This program would be a huge help.”

Miale is hoping that the USDA will give Maine distributors another chance, taking into account the logistical challenges of a sprawling, rural state with islands and mountains.

“They kind of put out a one-size-fits-all approach and it didn’t fit for everybody,” Miale said. “So now let’s go back and look at it again.”

Maine’s agricultural commissioner, Amanda Beal, formally asked the USDA to reopen the bidding process in the fall to give Maine distributors time to develop a way to participate.

“Like all small businesses in Maine, farmers in our state have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but are eager to continue to grow food for consumers,” Beal said in a letter to the USDA on Thursday. “Likewise, many families in Maine need extra support during this unprecedented time, and it has been projected that food insecurity in Maine could increase by as much as 39 percent in 2020 due to COVID-19. We are confident that the Farmers to Families Food Box Program can help provide much-needed support for both, but only if the program can be adapted and flexibility be given to fit individual state needs.”

In another corner of the country, Alaska was also left with no access to the program. Two companies submitted bids but the USDA didn’t accept them, according to Cara Durr, director of public engagement for the Food Bank of Alaska, which serves the entire state.

Though Alaska has kept its case count down to only about 400, the shutdowns imposed to control the outbreak have taken a steep economic toll and made it harder for remote communities — many inaccessible by road — to get needed supplies. The state’s budget is also heavily dependent on oil, whose price has cratered.

The Food Bank of Alaska found a workaround where one local company signed on as a subcontractor to a winning bidder. That company is now supplying hard fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, apples and oranges.

But they’re still not able to receive meat or dairy, and the shipments won’t reach outside Anchorage to more far-flung places like Fairbanks, Durr said.

“The cost to bring food up to Alaska wasn’t factored in,” Durr said. “We would have loved to have gotten more through this program. Supporting local in-state vendors when there are applications would have been a much better way to go, for our state at least.”

90,"Dec 31, 2020",NBC News,"As Covid surges in Mississippi Delta, food banks and hospitals are stretched thin","JACKSON, Miss. — Four days before Christmas, Chiquikta Fountain watched as a growing line of cars stretched down a mile of road in the Mississippi Delta.

From her vantage point, it seemed like every resident in the rural town of Shaw was en route to the holiday meal giveaway at Delta Hands for Hope, a nonprofit she runs to support the area’s children.

The Dec. 21 event was meant to be a cheerful affair, despite the desperate need. Hams had been purchased from a mom-and-pop grocery store. There were bags of freshly picked greens, potatoes and onions for sides. With schools on winter break, volunteers tucked cereal and cases of orange juice into bags to help tide over families with children into the new year.

There were only 140 meals to distribute in the town of roughly 1,700. The meals were meant for a group of families and senior citizens who have relied heavily on the nonprofit for weekly assistance. But word spread quickly and it soon became clear that the food on hand wouldn’t be enough.

As supplies dwindled, the group began passing out the remnants. Produce for one person, a few boxes of cereal for another.

“To have to turn these families away,” Fountain said, “I can’t even describe what it felt like to you to do that.”

Before the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger. Almost 40 percent of its residents live in poverty. In areas like Shaw, trying to make ends meet has become even more fraught as the county struggles with the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the Mississippi Delta.

Weekly case counts in December have surpassed the peak of the county’s summer surge, when so many fell ill that the county coroner asked the board of supervisors to purchase an extra refrigerator for fear he would run out of space to store the dead.

That the recent surge has so far claimed fewer lives compared to previous peaks has left little room for comfort. Cases in the county quadrupled in the weeks after Thanksgiving.

Statewide, hospitalizations for patients with the virus spiked, plummeting the number of available intensive care unit beds in the state’s rural areas and larger cities alike. By the third week of December, Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, the county’s only hospital, ran out of ICU beds, a situation that could recur as cases rise.

L. Nicole Stringfellow, who leads the Mississippi Delta office of Together for Hope, a nonprofit that assists the country’s poorest rural communities, has heard concerns about people with pneumonia showing up at hospitals only to be sent home with instructions to monitor their symptoms.

Caitlyn Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bolivar Medical Center, acknowledged that the hospital had seen an increase in patients, but said its admitting and triage practices had not changed.

The Covid-19 crisis has compounded existing health care challenges in Bolivar County: Almost 1 in 6 residents are uninsured and more likely to put off treatment as a result, and there is a shortage of medical providers.

Unlike major cities where people can access public transportation, residents without cars in rural areas like Shaw have few options for getting to medical appointments. Almost 1 in 8 households in Bolivar County lack a car, making carpooling for errands common.

Nurse practitioner Nora Gough-Davis owns Shaw Family Medical, a clinic that offers home coronavirus testing for patients without the means to come into town. Some patients feared exposing their loved ones to the virus if they asked for a ride.

Several times a week, Tracy Hall, a nurse at Shaw Family Medical, dons a surgical gown, mask, face shield and gloves and enters a home. Sometimes, she sees a patient lying on a couch, barely able to move as she swabs.

Every morning, her husband gives her the same goodbye.

""Babe, be safe.""

On the way to work, she says a prayer in her car. On occasion, patients have asked her to pray that their tests come back negative.

She understands their fears. In Bolivar County, the fallout from the virus has been particularly pernicious. Three out of every 1,000 residents in the area have died from Covid-19. Only a handful of communities in Mississippi — several of them, like Bolivar, predominantly Black and in the Delta — have lost more.

Before Mississippi’s state health officer uttered the words “hot spot,” before the local hospital ran out of ICU beds, health outcomes for Black residents in Bolivar County were already troubling.

The consequences of a shortage of health care providers in the Mississippi Delta have been evident for decades. Shorter lives. Higher rates of amputations. Stringfellow said political leaders haven’t paid enough attention to these disparities. The pandemic, she said, makes it harder to look away.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

She pointed out that four years ago, the State Health Department shut down one of the two state-run medical clinics in Bolivar. A steep drop in patients was cited as the reason, but Stringfellow said the health care needs in the region remain high.

“How do you catch those areas up?” she asked. “True access to health care.”

The current state of public education, economic opportunity, housing and health care in the region, all beleaguered in their respective ways, she argues, are “putting a Band-Aid on open-heart surgery.”

While the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has brought a note of hope for many front-line workers, physical health is only one part of the battle. The mental trauma that accompanies persistent poverty in the Delta has escalated as families struggle with the fallout of the pandemic.

“It’s like working in a funhouse mirror,” said Nadia Bethley, a psychologist with the Delta Health Center, a nonprofit that provides health care to low-income patients on a sliding fee scale. “Things weren’t great before. Now, they’re distorted and worse in a lot of ways.”

She feared for her patients leading up to the first Christmas some would experience without their loved ones. She worried about those who were already isolated becoming further detached, like many others around the world affected by this pandemic. Patients who loved attending church services and socializing before and after sermons didn’t feel the same connection online.

Others have survived the virus only to feel challenged cognitively, almost like they had a stroke. Bethley said they want to know if they’ll fully recover.

“Having to sit with people and hold space for that kind of uncertainty, shrugging my shoulders, like ‘I don’t know either,’ those are the kind of things that have hit hard the most,” she said.

Many of her patients have found their livelihoods in limbo.

“Family members who were the primary breadwinners are now dying,” Bethley said. “Do you go to work and put yourself at risk, or do you become homeless or starving?”

Job security remains fragile in the community. Half of the residents make less than $30,000 per year. And although Cleveland, the county seat of Bolivar, is a university town, which brings economic activity, good jobs are scarce enough that some residents travel across state lines for work. For two years, dozens of residents have gathered daily outside the county’s Walmart, one of the few grocery stores in the area, waiting for charter buses to ferry them to Memphis, Tennessee, two hours away, to work at a FedEx hub, where some workers make upwards of $18 per hour.

The county’s unemployment rate, which climbed to double digits in the summer, has since improved, but remains higher than this time last year.

Caressa McKay, a single mother of five in Shelby, a small town in Bolivar County, was laid off from her job at a day care center in June. She’s since found another job, but she still has to skip a phone bill or an electric bill some months to make sure her children have enough to eat.

The public assistance she receives is “not enough to constantly keep food on the table,” she said. Meals dropped off by her local school district help, but with her children home all day for remote schooling, they need more food.

“They have to eat,” she said. “I have to do what I have to do.”

Mississippi state Rep. Abe Hudson Jr., a Democrat who lives in Bolivar County, said workers have been hit hard as local businesses struggle to stay afloat.

The people who are seeking help, he said, run the gamut from middle-class professionals now stretched thin to elderly residents hesitant to enter grocery stores.

“You don’t realize the degree of need until you go out to some of these food distribution events,” Hudson said. “It’s a constant reminder of the fact that people are not getting paychecks.”

That reminder is never far from Fountain.

The nonprofit she leads, Delta Hands for Hope, previously served as a tutoring site for students and assisted with volunteer projects. Last spring, the center began operating an emergency food pantry.

But now, the food bank’s future is in question. Recently, the nonprofit went from receiving 800 boxes of fresh food twice a month to none.

The U.S. Agriculture Department’s food box program had changed its funding rules and declined to renew a contract with the farm that had been supplying Delta Hands for Hope.

Fountain’s group now uses a private grant to buy food from a corporate restaurant supplier with the goal of feeding at least 140 children and senior citizens in Shaw per week. She’s unsure if the funding will carry them past spring break.

Occasionally, she receives an alert that a church or a food bank in the region has enough to share. The group rents or borrows a truck to pick up the food.

“The biggest question is, ‘Are we going to remain an emergency food pantry?’” she asked. “What happens when those funds run out?”","Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi TodayBefore the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger.

When the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Revere HealthCare Center opened its therapeutic food pantry in January 2020, the plan was to start off with a three-month, 10-patient pilot program. The pantry would provide plenty of plant-based, healthy food to the patients, all of whom had nutrition-dependent chronic diseases, like diabetes and obesity, and were food insecure, meaning they lacked enough food to live a healthy and active life.

“Of course, then COVID hit,” says Jacob Mirsky, MD, a primary care physician at MGH Revere and the food pantry’s medical director.

The number of community members in the Boston area struggling to access nutritious food jumped in March as the measures put in place to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic hit them economically. Mirsky and his team decided to rehaul the entire operation and expand service to every patient treated at the center and their families.

With funding from MGH Revere and partnerships with local food nonprofits, the pantry grew from operating out of a closet to filling a 1,000-square-foot storage space and feeding up to 80 patients and their families each week.

Food insecurity across the country has risen significantly since the pandemic sidelined 14 million workers in the United States from February to May, according to the Pew Research Center.

Feeding America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States, estimates that 17 million people in the country could become food insecure because of the pandemic, bringing the total to more than 54 million people in the country, including 18 million children. Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

Since food insecurity and poor nutrition are associated with several chronic illnesses that put people at higher risk for the more severe complications of COVID-19, the food access crisis threatens to exacerbate the already glaring disparities in health outcomes for vulnerable people, including low-income people, children, older adults, and immigrants living in the United States illegally.

“Though the factors underlying racial and ethnic disparities in Covid-19 in the United States are multifaceted and complex, long-standing disparities in nutrition and obesity play a crucial role in the health inequities unfolding during the pandemic,” writes a cohort of physicians and researchers in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September. “A healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and calorie-dense processed foods, is essential to health. The ability to eat a healthy diet is largely determined by one’s access to affordable, healthy foods — a consequence of the conditions and environment in which one lives.”

Mirsky believes that it is incumbent upon the health care system, and particularly academic medical centers, to take on a greater role in educating and connecting patients to healthy and tasty foods — and consequently reduce the prevalence of nutrition-related illnesses.

“We’re now living in a world where it is abundantly clear that the power of doctors and medical students and trainees expands beyond the walls of a health care setting,” Mirsky says. “Building these types of solutions [that address social determinants of health] is just as important — if not more important — than prescribing them medicine.”

Food is medicine

Over the past decade, a growing body of research has linked poor nutrition to poor health outcomes, particularly in patients with chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. This can stem from not only a lack of food but also an excess of unhealthy food that can cause obesity and contribute to other health problems. For many, this could be because they live in a food desert, where there are no grocery stores within a mile of their home, or because unhealthy food may be cheaper and easier to access.

The research has birthed a movement known as “Food is Medicine,” where physicians, nutrition experts, and policymakers encourage the use of programs that provide medically-tailored food to prevent and treat serious illnesses in patients, as opposed to relying solely on pharmaceuticals and other health care interventions.

“Food is really critically important for many of the diseases that are plaguing our country and the world,” Mirsky says.

A report published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2017 found that food insecurity was associated with 10 of the costliest and most deadly preventable diseases in the country, including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.

Conversely, a healthier diet, particularly one that focuses on plant-based meals, has been associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases, depression, and decreased mental function.

Barriers to access

But for millions of people in the United States, eating enough nutritious food is far easier said than done. Certain groups living in the United States face additional barriers and risks when it comes to nutrition and health, particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Children: Nearly 30 million children in the United States qualified for free or reduced-cost lunches at school in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated food insecurity among children, as the estimated number of food-insecure kids could jump from 11 million to an estimated 18 million, according to Feeding America. While many schools have continued to provide meals to children in need and food banks and pantries have amped up services, the disruption could have concerning long-term consequences. Studies have linked food insecurity in children to poor health, stunted development, behavioral issues, and difficulty keeping up in school, according to Feeding America.

Older adults: Seniors, generally defined as people age 65 and older, are at increased risk of the more severe complications that come with COVID-19. Consequently, those who live on low and fixed incomes face greater barriers to accessing adequate nutrition. This can, in turn, further increase their vulnerability to poor health outcomes.

“A lot of older adults, unfortunately, don’t have a generous retirement income,” explains David Buys, PhD, MSPH, an associate professor at Mississippi State University Extension and College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who has studied food insecurity in older adults. “They might be living on nothing but Social Security. Some might not have Social Security. We know that we have an increasing number of grandparents raising grandchildren … that can be a challenge.”

Buys says that older adults who are frail or lack transportation may struggle to get to the grocery store or to a food pantry — and that some are afraid to go out and risk exposing themselves to infection.

Food banks, food pantries, and other community outreach organizations have had to be creative in ways that they serve older adults since the pandemic hit, such as delivering food to their homes, drawing on long-standing programs like Meals on Wheels, Buys says.

One study from before the pandemic found that, in a group of older adults discharged from the hospital, those seniors that received meals delivered by Meals on Wheels had lower rates of hospital readmission in three and six months than expected.

Providing healthy meals can be a key to keeping older adults healthy and out of the hospital or congregate health care situations that might increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. It’s an issue of particular concern since more than 84% of people over the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition and many face economic hardship as a result of medical debt, according to the National Council on Aging.

Immigrants in the United States illegally: While Latino communities in the United States in general have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, immigrants in the country without legal permission — many of whom are Latino — are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity because they are not eligible for many government relief programs. Even before the pandemic, 1 in 4 experienced food insecurity, according to a 2016 report by Bread for the World, a nonprofit dedicated to ending hunger.

While Medicaid programs in some states, including California and Massachusetts, are beginning to cover the cost of programs that provide food to patients, people living in the country illegally are not eligible for Medicaid. Nor are they eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, nor the $1,200 stimulus check that the federal government approved earlier this year.

“We see a movement right now to integrate more food and nutrition services into health care delivery and financing,” explains Sarah Downer, JD, associate director of whole person care at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School. “But every gap that we have is a place where undocumented immigrants fall into that gap.”

Instead, many rely on local food pantries for aid, which were stretched thin early in the pandemic while trying to accommodate millions of new clients, says David Velasquez, a fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School who is also pursuing a master of business administration at Harvard Business School and a master in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.

“Food is a basic human need. And it’s something that we all deserve.” David Velasquez

Fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School

Velasquez, who experienced food insecurity himself as the child of Nicaraguan parents who originally came to the United States illegally before being granted asylum, decided during the early months of the pandemic to research policies that could support food access for immigrants during this crisis.

He teamed up with another Harvard medical student, Jordan Kondo, and two attorneys from the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, Downer and Emily Broad Lieb, JD, to write a journal article that argued for policies that could help bring relief to immigrants who aren’t eligible for much government aid.

For example, they said the government should make it a priority to fund emergency food services programs that are accessible to those living in the country illegally, such as food banks and community health centers, and that health systems should ensure that they are not excluded from programs that integrate nutrition into health care delivery.

“Food is a basic human need,” Velasquez says. “And it’s something that we all deserve.”

Facing a long-term problem

When Mirsky was crafting the model for MGH Revere’s therapeutic food pantry, it was important to him that the pantry provide not only nutritious food but also the means to enjoy it.

Patients who visited the pantry initially received pots and pans, a spatula, oil, spices, and consultations with a nutritionist who could help them come up with recipes that they enjoy. The goal is to foster self-motivated healthy lifestyles. When the pantry expanded to a greater number of patients due to the pandemic, they could no longer offer all these services, but they hope to reintroduce them in the future.

“Food and eating are an essential part of the human experience,” Mirsky says. “Cooking and enjoying healthy food is a very powerful and respectful way of improving someone’s life.”

The MGH Revere pantry in the Boston area is just one of many nutrition outreach programs that health care providers across the country have increasingly implemented in recent years, as the American Hospital Association highlights in its social determinants of health report series. More health care providers are screening for food insecurity regularly and helping connect their patients to resources.

Still, food insecurity persisted before the pandemic, and the pandemic has further stretched existing community resources, as NPR reported in September.

Mirsky notes that the pantry at MGH Revere is already feeling the strain and is leading an effort to raise funds for a permanent location for the pantry. He’s also concerned about how much food they will be able to acquire in the winter, when there will be less local produce available and as renewed COVID-19 surges threaten to further stress systems.

“Our goal is to recognize that this is a very long-term problem that is going to require a long-term solution.”","Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

The new coronavirus has ushered in uncertainty for everyone, and this is especially true for low-income families and vulnerable populations across our state. The pandemic is heightening the uncertainty, financial instability and food insecurity faced by one in five Mississippians every day. It's also illuminating the dangers of inadequate access to affordable and quality health care and the desperate need for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed HR 6201, the Coronavirus Response Act. This act, in part, allows:

Expanded access to SNAP, WIC, and the emergency food assistance program during the pandemic;

Immediate paid sick leave and paid family leave, expanded unemployment insurance, vital nutrition aid;

More Medicaid funds for states; and

Free COVID-19 testing and treatment, including for Americans without health coverage.

What do Mississippi’s legislators do in the face of the unprecedented challenges caused by the spread of this pandemic? Do they rush to draft legislation to ensure protections for its most vulnerable citizens? No. Also on Tuesday, the Mississippi House of Representatives declared a three-week recess, effectively stalling any relief struggling Mississippians might receive. The Mississippi Senate suspended its session the following day.

Mississippi coronavirus: What state employees need to know

Session halted: Mississippi lawmakers reject bill

As we are all too aware, when it comes to this virus, a lot can happen in three weeks. For many Mississippians, it is the difference between life and death. I implore Mississippians to contact U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker to voice support for the Coronavirus Response Act and to contact their state representatives to urge compassionate action in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our elected officials’ failure to act immediately and decisively in the face of such imminent disaster is unconscionable and unacceptable. Contact your state legislator to demand the following actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Expand Medicaid to increase access to COVID-19 treatment for 163,000+ low-income Mississippians.

Leverage TANF dollars to offer emergency sick leave to low-income families.

Lift the legislature's 2017 prohibition on SNAP work requirement waivers previously available during economic downturns and job shortages. The pandemic illustrates the fragility of the service industry and many low-wage job opportunities.

Exempt groceries from Mississippi's general sales tax. Mississippi is one of just three states without a tax break on groceries, heightening hunger and poor health.

Place a moratorium on evictions, following the lead of several states and cities doing the same nationwide. Jackson's eviction rate is among the highest in the country and Mississippi's new law authorizing immediate eviction is among the harshest.

94,"Nov 18, 2020",Vicksburg Post,Shape Up Mississippi receives International Paper Foundation grant - The Vicksburg Post,"Shape Up Mississippi has been awarded a $5,000 grant from International Paper’s Vicksburg Mill and the International Paper Foundation.

Jami Cameron, communications coordinator for International Paper Vicksburg, said the funds from IP’s Planting Hope Initiative will provide residents with access and availability to fresh and healthy foods, fitness activities and culinary programs to teach proper nutrition.

The Planting Hope goals are to continue distributing local foods to food pantries, increase U-pick days and extend the Vicksburg Community Garden’s reach to residents in need.

Shape Up Mississippi founder Linda Fondren said she was excited about the opportunities the grant makes available.

“The Vicksburg Community Garden Park is a valuable resource for the surrounding community, especially to promote exercise during the pandemic,” Fondren said. “We want to ensure that residents know it is available.”

Fondren said new signs showing access to the walking trail at the Vicksburg Community Garden Park will be built and a sensory interpretive trail on the paved walking trail, including planting 20 native plants purchased locally, will be established.

Benches will provide a place for visitors to rest and admire the park and there are ways the garden can be used as an outdoor classroom.

“Our garden is inside a locked fence,” Fondren said. “We can now build an interactive space with three raised beds outside the fence so visitors can access the raised beds at any time and learn about plants and herbs.”

The grant will also pay for installing paving stones and the purchase of garden tools.

“The support of International Paper also allows us to generate community attention and increase our reach for volunteers at the VCG,” Fondren said. “With the USDA/EPA’s Local Food Local Places technical assistance, we hope to create a sustainable plan to incorporate the VCG with the Vicksburg Farmer’s Market and the Catfish Row Museum’s demonstration kitchen and marketplace to create a food hub in our historic downtown.”

“We are so appreciative and excited to receive this grant from International Paper and to work with residents and IP volunteers to grow a more sustainable community,” Fondren said. “I can’t wait to sit down and discuss the volunteer opportunities you have so my team members can get involved.

95,"Mar 28, 2020",,What Happens If Workers Cutting Up the Nation’s Meat Get Sick?,"Series: On the Line How the Meatpacking Industry Became a Hotbed of COVID-19

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

Here’s what has happened in the meatpacking industry in the last week alone:

A federal food safety inspector in New York City, who oversaw meat processing plants, died from the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

A poultry worker in Mississippi, employed by America’s third largest chicken company, tested positive for the virus, causing a half-dozen workers to self-quarantine. Another worker in South Dakota, employed by the world’s largest pork producer, also tested positive.

In Georgia, dozens of workers walked out of a Perdue Farms chicken plant, demanding that the company do more to protect them.

And Tyson Foods told ProPublica on Friday that “a limited number of team members” had tested positive for the disease.

As COVID-19 makes its way across the country, leading to panic grocery buying in state after state, the stresses on the nation’s food supply chain have ratcheted ever higher. But in industries like meatpacking, which rely on often grueling shoulder-to-shoulder work, so have the risks to workers’ health.

In interviews this week, meat and poultry workers, some in the country without authorization, noted with irony that they have recently been labeled “essential” by an administration now facing down a pandemic. Yet the rules of their workplaces — and the need to keep food moving — pressure them to work in close quarters, even when sick.

Help Us Continue Reporting on COVID-19 Are you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we’re on track. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.

And it’s unclear how federal regulations that traditionally protect workers from harm in their workplaces will address a potentially deadly coronavirus.

“They are listening about social distancing on the TV and some of them try to practice it in their home, but when they go to work, they can’t do it,” said Father Roberto Mena, who ministers to many poultry workers at St. Michael Catholic Church in Forest, Mississippi.

Many of the nation’s meatpackers declined to respond to specific questions about how they’ve dealt with infected workers or what they’ve done to try to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in their plants. Or they offered vague assurances that workers are being protected.

So far, only two meatpacking companies — Tyson Foods and Cargill — have announced companywide temperature checks to screen employees for signs of the virus. Two more say they have begun rolling them out.

But except for unionized plants, meat and poultry workers rarely get paid when they’re sick. At many companies, including Tyson, workers receive disciplinary points for calling in sick. Because points lead to termination, workers told ProPublica, they and some of their colleagues have continued to work even when sick, despite the coronavirus.

“We are all afraid,” said Maria, who works on the evisceration line at a Tyson plant in Arkansas and asked to be identified by her first name. “The problem is if people feel sick, they’re not going to say anything because they need the money. They don’t want the points.”

In an email, Tyson said it had recently altered its policies to allow workers who contract the coronavirus or exhibit symptoms to apply for short-term disability without a waiting period. “This is an evolving situation and we’re continuing to consider additional measures to support our team,” spokesman Worth Sparkman said. “We don’t want team members who feel sick to come to work.”

Tyson announced this month it was “eliminating any punitive effect for missing work due to illness.” But Maria said that at her plant, nothing had changed.

Despite the “essential” role meat and poultry workers play in the food chain, the sick-time bill signed by President Donald Trump last week doesn’t cover most meat and poultry workers because it exempts companies with more than 500 employees.

The uncertain economy, with millions of people filing jobless claims last week, is adding to the tension.

At Koch Foods in Mississippi, Ramirez, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant who asked to go by his last name, said a woman who worked near him showed up for her shift last week with a heavy cough. But after she told her supervisor, he said, she was told she couldn’t come back. The message was clear, he said. So, when he started feeling sick a few days later, he simply kept quiet and continued working.

“People are worried,” Ramirez said, that if they say they are sick, “they’ll fire us.”

Going to the doctor is not an option, he said, because he doesn’t have health insurance and fears it could expose his immigration status.

Koch Foods didn’t respond to calls and emails asking about its policies for sick workers.

Even before the coronavirus, the meat industry had complained of a labor shortage as low pay and harsh conditions collided with a tight labor market, tighter borders and dramatic reductions by the Trump administration in the number of refugees, who make up the backbone of many plants’ workforce.

While there’s no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food, workers say they fear it could spread among them, even though they wear butcher coats and latex gloves, and the plants are sanitized every night.

If it does, it could take out a critical cog in the nation’s food supply chain just as it struggles to keep up with increased demand, workers and their advocates said. Grocery meat sales, excluding deli meat, surged a staggering 77% for the week ending March 15, according to one industry analysis.

To meet the demand, companies have been scrambling, adding additional weekend shifts and changing lines to produce whole birds and bigger cuts of beef. Under pressure from unions and wage increases at supermarkets and warehouses, some companies like Cargill and National Beef have announced temporary $2 per hour bonuses for the next several weeks to retain their workers and reward them for sticking through difficult times.

Company executives have said that the empty shelves aren’t a sign of a food shortage and that they’re capable of meeting the surge, aided in part by lower demand from restaurants that have been ordered to close.

“Our primary focus is to keep our plants running so that we can feed America,” Tyson’s president, Dean Banks, said on CNN. “We’re running the plants as hard as we can.”

And some analysts note that even if an outbreak of the virus forced a plant to close, the industry — with more than 500,000 employees at 4,000 slaughterhouses and processing plants across the country — is big enough to absorb the loss.

Tim Ramey, a retired food industry analyst, said “there could be significant disruptions” in a company’s output if an outbreak occurred. But supermarkets and restaurants buy meat from many suppliers, he said, and another plant could pick up the slack.

“There are plenty of ways you could have risk to the worker supply,” Ramey said. “I doubt that would be enough to disrupt the food supply.”

But no one knows what would happen if multiple plants suffered outbreaks.

The closest precedent may be immigration raids, which have temporarily shuttered meat and poultry plants periodically over the last 25 years. For months after, those plants struggled to find new workers and ramp up to speed. But the supply lines continued to feed America.

Read More Can Low-Wage Industries Survive Without Immigrants and Refugees Case Farms’ history shows how many sectors like meatpacking depend on immigrants and refugees. Now business leaders fear President Trump’s policies will create a labor shortage.

Some immigrant workers caught up in those raids now marvel that the country is leaning on them. Last summer, after finishing his shift pulling the guts out of thousands of chickens, Ramirez flipped on his TV and watched in shock as immigration agents descended on central Mississippi, rounding up hundreds of his coworkers in the Trump administration’s biggest immigration sting.

In the weeks that followed, Ramirez watched the three children of a friend who’d been detained and hunkered down at home, fearing he could be next. It was easy to feel disposable, he said, especially when Trump praised the raids as “a very good deterrent.”

Now, when Ramirez watches the news, Trump is calling workers like him “critical,” telling them, “you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule.”

“I don’t understand, if they have a big need for all of the workers,” Ramirez asked, “why aren’t they worried about us?”

The slaughtering of chickens, hogs and cattle has become increasingly automated in the last few decades. But several tasks on the disassembly line still have to be done by hand. In poultry plants, in an area known as “live hang,” workers in a small, black-lit room crowd around a trough grabbing live chickens by their feet and hanging them on shackles.

In another area known as “debone,” workers stand side by side cutting raw chicken into breasts and tenders, so close that they occasionally cut coworkers with their knives.

In pork plants, workers are so packed together that a little over a decade ago, two dozen workers at a Minnesota factory developed a neurological illness from inhaling aerosolized pig brains that drifted from a nearby station that was making an ingredient used in stir-fry thickeners.

So even as everyone from the president to Snoop Dogg are urging people to stay home and avoid groups of more than 10 people, meat and poultry workers are required to do the opposite.

ProPublica asked the nation’s largest meat companies what they were doing to try to achieve social distancing. Cargill, which produces billions of pounds of beef and turkey for supermarkets and restaurants each year, was the only company that said it was doing anything other than staggering start and break times. Daniel Sullivan, a spokesman for the Minnesota-based meatpacker, said it had increased spacing in its factory work areas and put up partitions in its cafeteria.

The evisceration line where Maria, the Tyson employee, works doesn’t have as many people as other parts of the factory because it is heavily automated. But she said that because workers can’t leave the line unless it’s an emergency, she regularly encounters large crowds as everyone rushes to the bathroom during breaks. The company has placed hand sanitizers at the entrance, she said, but inside the plant, the bathrooms don’t always have paper towels.

As COVID-19 cases at the plants become public, workers fear it’s only the beginning.

On Monday, Sanderson Farms, the nation’s third largest chicken company, said an employee at its McComb, Mississippi, plant had tested positive for the virus. Sanderson said the employee’s work area was contained to one small processing table. In response, the company notified its workers and sent six other employees in the work area home to self-quarantine with pay.

The company did not respond to calls or emails seeking additional information.

On Thursday, a worker at pork producer Smithfield Foods’ plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, tested positive. The company told the Argus Leader that the employee’s work area and all common areas were “thoroughly sanitized.” But it did not say anything about workers who might have come in contact with the employee.

There have been even fewer details about the federal food safety inspector who died. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement that he was “terribly saddened to hear” that one of the department’s employees had passed away due to the coronavirus and thanked “those working on the front lines of our food supply chain.” But the department did not specify which plants the inspector had worked in or what had been done to alert or quarantine others the inspector may have been in contact with.

Paula Schelling, a union representative for the nation’s food inspectors at the American Federation of Government Employees, said the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service needs to do more to protect its front-line workers.

“FSIS is doing nothing to provide any protection for any employee who is out in the field,” she said. “They are just saying, ‘We are following the CDC guidelines.’ What does that mean to us?”

“People are worried,” a Koch Foods worker said. (Rory Doyle for ProPublica)

Concerns that meat companies aren’t being forthcoming have already led to increased anxiety at several plants. Workers who walked out of the Perdue plant in Georgia said the unrest started because supervisors dismissed concerns that some employees were continuing to work despite being in contact with people who had the coronavirus.

“We’re not getting nothing,” Kendilyn Granville told a TV news reporter outside the plant Monday night. “No type of compensation, no nothing, not even no cleanliness, no extra pay — no nothing. We’re up here risking our life for chicken.”

Perdue spokeswoman Diana Souder said that after speaking with managers, the majority of those who walked out returned to work.

“We know that many are feeling anxious during these uncertain times and we’re doing everything we can to take good care of our associates while continuing to produce safe and reliable food,” she said.

Typically, when workers feel unsafe, they can complain to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But it’s unclear how OSHA will respond to complaints related to the coronavirus. The agency, which has seen its ranks depleted under the Trump administration, has issued guidance for employers. But there is no specific standard related to the virus, and the agency has not said how it might interpret its general duty clause, which requires employers to keep their worksites free from recognized hazards that might cause death or “serious physical harm.”

Employers are only required to notify OSHA when an employee is hospitalized, suffers an amputation or is killed at work. But under a patchwork of rules, some employers might have to notify their state and local health departments.

As cases started to pop up this week, some employers began offering additional pay. Perdue said it would provide all hourly workers a $1-per-hour raise for the next several weeks. Hormel, the maker of Spam, said it would offer a $300 bonus for full-time workers and $150 for part-time associates.

On Thursday, the United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents 250,000 food processing workers, said it had negotiated additional pay and benefits increases, including a $600 bonus in May for its members at the nation’s second-largest meatpacker, JBS, which includes Pilgrim’s chicken. JBS spokesman Cameron Bruett did not answer whether the company would match that for nonunion employees.

Several large meat and poultry companies, including Tyson, Smithfield, Sanderson and Koch, have not announced raises or bonuses.

On Friday, Perdue told ProPublica it was starting to roll out temperature checks at its plants. And Bruett said JBS had set up “triage stations” outside plants to screen employees for temperature and symptoms. But it’s unclear if all employees will be tested or only those exhibiting symptoms.

Meanwhile, Venceremos, a group advocating for poultry workers in northwest Arkansas, has started a petition asking that Tyson and other processors provide paid sick leave for workers as the coronavirus begins to spread to rural America.

“Everyone is realizing that they are essential and have been essential to the country,” said Magaly Licolli, one of the group’s leaders. “And now it’s time that everybody should demand fair rights for them. That’s what we’ve been arguing all this time. They are the ones that provide for the country.”

100,"Dec 6, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Child hunger in Mississippi is real. Let's solve the food insecurity problem.,"Between the great American feast days of Thanksgiving and Christmas seems like the right time to write about child hunger. Our state has a persistent problem with hunger and food insecurity, with over half a million Mississippians regularly struggling to get enough to eat.

Hunger is especially hard on children and Mississippi still has the highest rate of food-insecure children in the US, according to Feeding America. Some regularly miss meals. About half of Mississippi households receiving SNAP federal food assistance include children.

Lynn Evans (Photo: File photo/The Clarion-Ledger)

We know that our persistent poverty is largely to blame; 50 of Mississippi’s food-insecure counties have had poverty rates of 20 percent or more for over 30 years. However, policy decisions on both the federal and state levels also affect who gets enough to eat.

A lack of accessible grocery stores plagues large parts of our state. Attempts by Senator David Blount and Rep. Jarvis Dortch in the state Legislature to get bills passed providing tax incentives for opening grocery stores in Food Deserts are regularly killed by lobbyists for the fast-food industry since people eat less fast food if there is a good grocery store nearby.

The current administration in Washington has been looking for ways to cut federal food assistance expenditures, including school lunches and SNAP. Under rules introduced under the Obama administration, all students in a public school or even all the students in a public school district can get free lunches if the percentage of low-income children qualifying for free lunch there is 40 percent or more. The 40 percent can include children on SNAP, children in foster care, and children who are homeless.

Feeding breakfast and lunch to all the children in a public school for free cuts down on paperwork and administrative costs, and makes it easier for school kitchens to provide more appetizing and nutritious meals. And it eliminates student lunch debt. According to the USDA, about 13.7 million schoolchildren attend public schools where everyone eats free. Something good to eat makes it easier for children to concentrate on learning. However, newly proposed rules by the Trump administration would make it harder to qualify for this federal funding and add paperwork.

Several Democratic candidates for president are calling for the expansion of the free school lunch program to all public school students, something that would cost about $19.6 billion a year. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, and Bernie Sanders have all proposed some version of free lunch programs for all public school students. Castro’s plan would also provide low-income students with three meals a day during summer months.

Castro further proposes federal grants to help open grocery stores in food deserts. As many small towns in this state have learned, a grocery store can be a linchpin that not only improves people’s access to fresh and nutritious food and provides good jobs, but also helps other small businesses prosper.

Although food deserts are most often found in rural areas, there are parts of Hinds County, including in Jackson, that qualify as food deserts because there are no nearby grocery stores. Add that to the fact that a full fourth of the people in Hinds County are food insecure. People in food deserts, by definition high poverty areas, can pay up to 37 percent more for the exact same produce as everybody else.

Surely we all agree that it is not good for children to go hungry. It’s not good for children’s brains or general health, or their overall sense of well-being. Children who grow up food insecure are more likely to develop diabetes, high blood pressure, have strokes, have complications during pregnancy, and get cancer.

It is not a hard fix. All it takes is the will to do it.

101,"Nov 13, 2018",Mississippi Public Broadcasting,An alliance in Mississippi is fighting hunger on college campuses,"Students are in line at the cafeteria at Tougaloo College

At least thirty-six percent of university students are food insecure, meaning they don't have reliable access to nutritious food. Colleges and universities in Mississippi are partnering to feed more students they say are missing meals. MPB's Ashley Norwood reports.



It's lunch time in the cafeteria at Tougaloo College.

Makaylah Hampton, a student at the college near Jackson, says for some this is their last meal for the day.

""If you don't have a car, you can't get to places cause the cafe closes at like 6:30 I think. Especially on Tuesday's and Thursday's cause people have longer classes because of lab. So some people don't even get out of class until like 8:30 so then you miss dinner. So now, you don't have anything to eat,"" said Hampton.

The College and University Anti-Hunger Alliance of Mississippi is a coalition of institutions and organizations across the state. They are creating food pantries accessible to students in an effort to combat hunger on college campuses.

Tougaloo College, Jackson State University and Coahoma Community College in Clarksdale have already committed to opening food pantries on campus.

Karen Done, director of student engagement at Coahoma, says there's a greater need on community college campuses. According to a national survey conducted by Wisconsin HOPE Lab, at least 42 percent of community college students are food insecure, compared to 36 percent of students attending universities.

""Majority of our students are pell-grant eligible which means that they're coming from homes where there's a financial need. And, because there's that need there's a large percentage of students who are often financially lacking and are hungry,"" said Done.

104,"Oct 16, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,"Ole Miss, MSU meal plans skyrocket as contractor Aramark pays for new facilities","CLOSE

Under deals with contractors, universities have hiked meal plan prices significantly in recent years, adding to rising cost of college.

Students eat lunch at Perry Cafeteria at Mississippi State Tuesday, October 9, 2019. (Photo: Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi Today)

Editor's note: The Southern Foodways Alliance has collaborated with the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger, AL.com and Mississippi Today to shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi.

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food.Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an ""unlimited"" meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal ""swipes"" didn't roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).""

Glasper isn't alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country, and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor, Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

""Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,"" said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

Story continues below gallery.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State's operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

RELATED: Real food challenge: Auburn University, unlike peers, requires 20% local source of dining food

But contractors eventually ran out of ""ways to distinguish themselves on the service side"" when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

""Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it,"" he said.

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12 percent commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn't reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a ""campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan ""is much, much more expensive"" than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won't use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

Students at Mississippi State University enjoy the meals at the campus' Fresh Food Company dining facility Tuesday, October 9, 2019. (Photo: Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi Today)

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,"" Mac Dermott said of meal options. ""They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a ""food-court environment"" where managers can ""interchange menu concepts very easily,"" said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

Moe's Southwest Grill at Mississippi State Tuesday, October 9, 2019. (Photo: Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi Today)

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.""

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into a “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

""Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,"" said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. ""They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they're going to have access to (at home).""

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but ""we've adjusted"" to student demand. ""Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there's going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the ""Ultimate"" plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren't using the rising prices to ""pad the pocket of the institution."" She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshmen are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 ""Rebel Unlimited Plus 1"" plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract ""to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,"" said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar ""Dining Dollars"" food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama's contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid such as Pell Grants doesn't always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better about using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,"" Grant said. ""But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefits package, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there,"" he said. Eventually, it was ""ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.”

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,"" Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017.

""I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,"" he said. ""We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

For 2019, the Southern Foodways Alliance (SFA), an institute of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, has explored the labor of food through symposia, films, podcasts, and other media. The SFA collaborated with AL.com, the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion-Ledger, and Mississippi Today to produce three interlocked stories, Food Is Work. Together, they shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi — the largest public universities in Alabama and Mississippi.

105,"Aug 26, 2020",,Dole Packaged Foods Takes Action To Address Global Food Accessibility Challenge,"Taking action on its promise to make nutritious foods accessible for 1 billion people by 2025, Dole introduces Sunshine for All program in one of America's largest food deserts: Jackson, MS

JACKSON, Mississippi, Aug. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Delivering on ""The Dole Promise"" and to address the global food insecurity crisis that has escalated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Dole Packaged Foods today announced the Sunshine for All program, dedicated to bringing fresh and packaged produce, nutritious meals and educational opportunities to communities that need it the most. Dole chose Jackson, MS—a city with one of America's largest food deserts and only one grocery store for every 10,000 residents—to kick-start this program.

Access to healthy food is a global challenge and one that impacts thousands of U.S. cities and over 40 million people nationwide. This crisis has been further exacerbated by the growing problem of income disparity and, more recently, the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of access to full-service grocery stores, farmers' markets and other vendors that sell nutritious fruits and vegetables has created food deserts and food swamps across the country. Food deserts are defined as areas that have limited access to affordable and nutritious food. On the contrary, food swamps are areas with an abundance of fast food restaurants, convenience stores and liquor stores that primarily sell junk food.

""Our program goes beyond donations to address the critical challenges of accessibility and affordability, as well as nutrition education in communities around the world,"" said Pier Luigi Sigismondi, President of Dole Worldwide Packaged Foods. ""Jackson will serve as a blueprint for how we're going to tackle these challenges in other food deserts using a hyper-local model. Together with partners, we're building a foundation that will drive systemic change within individual communities and our society at large.""

In fact, consumers can nominate a city as Dole's next Sunshine for All location. To enter, send an email to [email protected] or post using #SunshineforAllYOURCITY via Instagram, Twitter or Facebook telling Dole what city should be should be the next stop.

Selections will be made by Dole based on need (access to fresh foods, status as a food desert or food swamp), number of posts using the hashtag and mentioning your city and quality of entry (did it address why, creativity). The second Dole Sunshine for All destination will be announced on Giving Tuesday, December 1, 2020.

Sunshine for All in Jackson

Jackson was selected because the city has only 20 grocery stores, and of those stores, less than 5 percent stock locally grown fresh produce. In contrast, there are 70 fast food restaurants, 60 convenience stores, and 150 gas stations that primarily sell unhealthy options.

To mark the program launch, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has proclaimed today Sunshine for All Day in Jackson. Along with the mayor, Dole has partnered with local chefs and organizations including the Boys and Girls Club of Central Mississippi, Up in Farms, The Urban League, Smoothie King and Foot Print Farms to creatively tackle the challenge of getting nutritious foods into underserved areas in Jackson. Key program elements include:

A $75,000 donation from Dole Packaged Foods to Up in Farms to support their Farm-to-Table Training Center and sustainably equip the commissary to provide 1,000 nutritious meals/day to those in need.

ATLANTA — The convenience-store industry plays a critical role in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by providing a handy place for economically disadvantaged citizens to buy food, RaceTrac Petroleum’s chief executive recently told members of the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture.

RaceTrac CEO Max McBrayer Jr. earlier this month testified before the Agriculture Committee that c-stores help alleviate food insecurity in the United States by providing 24-hour food access for SNAP beneficiaries, particularly those in rural areas.

RaceTrac and RaceWay c-stores provide nearly 1,700 SNAP-eligible food products at more than 750 locations in 11 states throughout the Southeast. RaceTrac’s stores, open 24 hours a day, process approximately 3 million electronic benefit transfers annually.

“No American should go hungry,” McBrayer testified. “As active partners in SNAP, we provide essential food access to the thousands of people in our communities who have come to rely on us. Our continuous and extended hours ensure that customers are always able to access our stores to purchase the food they need at any time. Together, we can fulfill the program’s goal to alleviate hunger and food insecurity across the country.”

RaceTrac’s participation in SNAP enables beneficiaries to access food without excessive inconvenience or expense, he said. Low-income Americans often work—and shop for food—during unconventional hours, and the c-store industry accommodates this. RaceTrac stores are often the only easily accessible retail food store in a particular area and are consistently open longer than other large-format food retailers, he said.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the percent of SNAP transactions at RaceTrac stores has doubled, McBrayer testified.

“COVID-19 has exacerbated what was already an unacceptable situation,” he said. “It is clear to all of us at RaceTrac that many of our guests have been struggling to make ends meet and are experiencing food insecurity. SNAP benefits are critical to ensuring that our most economically vulnerable citizens have access to the food they need.”

Deemed “essential critical infrastructure” by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), RaceTrac has remained open throughout the pandemic, providing food and fuel to the public.

With headquarters in Atlanta, family-owned RaceTrac has been serving customers since 1934 and now operates more than 560 convenience stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas.","Photograph courtesy of RaceTracATLANTA — The convenience-store industry plays a critical role in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by providing a handy place for economically disadvantaged citizens to buy food, RaceTrac Petroleum’s chief executive recently told members of the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mary Altaffer/AP Mary Altaffer/AP

Slightly more than 6% of American adults have received at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine — but a disproportionately small number of them are Black and Hispanic people.

""What we're seeing from the states that are currently reporting data on vaccination distribution by race and ethnicity is a consistent pattern that is really showing a mismatch between who's receiving the vaccine and who has been hardest hit by the pandemic,"" says Samantha Artiga, the director of the Racial Equity and Health Policy Program at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The group has been tracking data from the 17 states that are publicly reporting vaccination patterns by race and ethnicity, and significant disparities are emerging.

In Mississippi, 15% of vaccinations have been received by Black people, while they account for 38% of coronavirus cases and 42% of deaths in the state. In Texas, Hispanic people make up 15% of those who have been vaccinated, compared to 44% of cases and nearly half of the deaths.

Artiga notes that the data so far is both early and limited: for instance, only a small number of states are reporting race and ethnicity data right now, and the vaccine currently is available only to high-priority groups.

Nonetheless, the current patterns are ""early warning flags about potential racial disparities in access to and uptake of the vaccine,"" according to the Kaiser Family Foundation report.

Vaccine appointments often require things like Internet access, reliable transportation and flexible work schedules. That troubles Artiga.

""How many people may be left behind if those are the resources that are required to access the vaccine?"" she says.

In an interview with All Things Considered, Artiga discusses what can be done to help improve access to the vaccine. Here are excerpts.

In Washington, D.C., the health department has been narrowing vaccines sign-ups by zip code, to try to target less affluent, less white neighborhoods. Have you heard of similar efforts around the country?

We are increasingly hearing that areas are adding new vaccination sites and adopting new sign-up processes to help make the vaccine more available for people. So as you noted, D.C. is prioritizing certain wards for appointments based on some of the early data that were showing disparities and who was able to access the vaccine.

I believe there are some health systems and areas that are planning to provide appointments, based on lottery systems when vaccines become available. I'm hearing now of some mobile vaccine clinics that are going into operation to go directly into communities. And there are other areas that are also beginning to adopt this approach of targeting specific geographic areas that we know have been hardest hit by the pandemic and may have more limited resources to be able to navigate sign-up processes for vaccines.

I'm thinking about the challenge of setting up a national vaccination campaign that has to administer hundreds of millions of doses, and layering on top of that a need to make it accessible to people who might not have a vehicle, who might not have easy access to the Internet. How important is it to front load those accessibility issues if you're going to make this campaign work?

I really think the early data, and what we know about people's willingness and concerns related to the vaccine, point to the importance of having a multipronged approach that is seeking to address access barriers and provide information and education to help address people's questions and concerns.

And I think that we also can learn a lot by listening directly to communities about how and where they want to access the vaccine, where they will feel comfortable accessing the vaccine, and who they want information from about the safety of the vaccine.

109,"Aug 13, 2020",Civil Eats,Just What the Doctor Ordered: Produce Prescriptions are More Important—and Popular—Than Ever.,"Since 2019, the VeggieRx produce prescription program in Chicago has offered food-insecure residents with diet-related illnesses free local produce every week. Patients receive prescriptions from primary care physicians and dietitians, and can pick up a weekly bag of fruits and veggies, as well as take cooking lessons.

The program operates in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago, where the diabetes mortality rate is 62 percent higher than the national average, and it played a key role in helping residents get access to fresh, whole foods before the pandemic. Over the last five months, however, it has seen a surge in demand.

“Prior to COVID, we had about 35 to 70 weekly boxes across our three locations—and now the sites are [serving] upwards of 130 to 160 boxes per week,” says Kris Delatorre, an urban farmer at Windy City Harvest, the organization that grows produce for the VeggieRx program at three farms throughout the city.

Produce prescription programs (PPPs) like this one are designed to serve patients with chronic health issues including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, allowing them to access healthy foods at a subsidized price. Many PPPs operate through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program, which started in 1992. The numbers have skyrocketed in the last 10 years; in 2010, 36 states had programs, today, 49 states have them.

Now, with the global pandemic, existing programs have grown in scope, new programs are in the works, and research is ramping up to make sure PPPs remain economically sustainable even after COVID-19 is brought under control.

Delatorre attributes the increased usage to the health concerns of its primary clients—people with pre-existing conditions who feel a grocery store run is too risky. In response to the pandemic, the VeggieRx program now offers touch-free pickup to meet social distancing guidelines.

“It’s clear we need to pull out all the stops to help families stretch their food dollars.”

But that may not be the only reason these programs have so much appeal in the current moment. Healthy diets are known to strengthen the body’s immune response, and the immune system needs more energy when its actively battling an illness or infection. A recent study from University of Southampton, found that vitamin A (which carrots and sweet potatoes provide) and zinc (from broccoli and spinach, among other vegetables) are the most essential nutrients for successfully fighting off infection. As healthcare providers look for ways to help prevent or alleviate pre-existing conditions that often cause a more severe, if not fatal, course of the virus, PPPs are increasingly being seen as a preventative healthcare measure.

“It’s clear we need to pull out all the stops to help families stretch that food dollar wide, especially when it comes to healthy food. That’s where produce prescription programs come in,” said Sarah Reinhardt, the lead food systems and health analyst for the Food & Environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Right now it’s more important than ever. With hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 [patients], everything we can do to ensure better health is key for us to beat the impact this virus has on our society. It’s not a magic bullet, but it is an important part of the framework.”

Even so, Reinhardt and other PPP proponents wonder if the model can survive the pandemic or—better yet—grow to become a widely accepted tool for combatting diet-related illnesses.

Reaching Underserved Communities in NYC

Two of the largest barriers to a long-term healthy lifestyle are financial constraints and a lack of access to fruits and vegetables, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which found PPPs had a positive impact on patients’ rate of hypertension.

Since the pandemic began, health professionals have drawn a connection between neighborhoods with limited access to high-quality produce and those that had higher-than-average numbers of life-threatening COVID cases. In New York City, once the global epicenter of the outbreak, neighborhoods such as Far Rockaway in Queens, Flatbush in Brooklyn, and Pelham Gardens in the Bronx have seen the highest number of deaths. These are predominantly communities of color, where residents have low median household incomes, and a higher percentage of residents with pre-existing conditions than the city’s average. They all also have low enough access to healthy foods to be considered “food deserts.”

In 2017, the New York City Department of Health launched the Pharmacy to Farm PPP, partnering with pharmacies to issue coupons totaling $30 a month to residents who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and fill blood-pressure prescriptions at participating independent pharmacies. With the coupons, the patients can receive fruit and vegetables at nearby farmers’ markets.","Since 2019, the VeggieRx produce prescription program in Chicago has offered food-insecure residents with diet-related illnesses free local produce every week.

112,"May 31, 2020",The Guardian,'People are going to go hungry': pandemic effects could leave 54m Americans without food,"A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.

Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures.

As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year – a 63% increase compared to 2018.

Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

America’s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities.

It’s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020.

The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% – 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 – and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% – 4.8 points higher than 2018.

In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children.

Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen.

“We were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don’t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.

Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. “People are going to go hungry, that’s the truth,” said Scott.

The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year – a rise of almost 60% since 2018.

Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February.

“This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

On Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, 1,400 or so cars lined up at a mobile distribution point, which was open for three hours, for grocery boxes of canned fruits, pinto beans, pasta, milk, fresh vegetables, frozen meat and bread, to help make ends meet for a month.

Historically, there was a shortfall of 34m meals every year in the five counties served by the Community Food Bank of southern Arizona. Currently, the demand remains sky high – double pre-pandemic levels, and statewide 17% of the workforce have claimed unemployment since the start of the crisis.

“We were getting darn close to closing the meal gap before the crisis,” said Michael McDonald, the CEO. “But if demand continues at this rate for the rest of the year or into next year, we’re going to fall way short. I don’t see us being able to keep up without a longer-term commitment from the federal government.”

One in three children in Arizona could go hungry this year without food aid.

Food banks aren’t in it alone.

Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product.

In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)’s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries.

But it’s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights.

“Everything feels so unpredictable, I’ve literally no idea what’s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,” said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.

In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 – a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit. Only a tiny fraction of the USDA contracts went to distributors in New England.

As states start to reopen for business, economic recovery is expected to be painfully slow especially if further outbreaks are not adequately contained, which could trigger a full-blown second wave of the pandemic. Underemployment could last for years, which means millions of Americans are likely to need help with food, utilities and rent in the medium and long term.

Los Angeles county, where almost half the state of California’s Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, is projected to have 1.68 million food insecure people this year – the highest number in the country. It’s the most populous county in the US, with 10 million residents, where unemployment has risen to 20.3% – five percentage points higher than the state average – and food stamp applications have almost tripled compared with last year.

“If the numbers stay like this, no way food banks can cope, it’s beyond our capabilities, a lot will depend on how long federal help lasts,” said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Food Bank, which has distributed 80% more groceries since the pandemic began.

Susan King, president of Feeding Northeast Florida, agrees: “It’s when the dust settles that I’m most worried about, when the federal and state help is over but the line of people waiting for food is still long.”

King added: “This is a marathon, we can’t sugarcoat how scary it is; it absolutely keeps me up at night.”","Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.
Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels.
We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.
Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country.

One out of five people in the state does not know where their next meal will come from. MPB’s Alexandra Watts spends a day in a food pantry to see what happens when demand is larger than supply.

It’s a Saturday Morning in Charleston, and Joe Young and Faith Food Pantry volunteers are getting ready to hand out boxes of food to Tallahatchie County residents at Faith Baptist Church.

“Normally we serve 350 to 375 people,"" Young said. ""A month ago, we served over 400 on this day, and that was a record crowd — for Saturday.”

According to Feeding America, Mississippi is the most food-insecure state in the nation. Twenty percent of Mississippians lack reliable access to a sufficient quality of affordable nutritious food.

Young, a pastor, runs another food pantry at Parchman. He said food distributions are scheduled in the middle of the month on purpose.

“We do our food pantry in all locations on the third Saturday of the month,"" he said. ""[We think] when they run our food stamps, that we can be their backup. We try to help them out when their month gets longer than their check.”

Lee Fayne is one of those people. He stands outside the church and says his disability check and food stamps are not enough to cover his expenses.

""I pay the bills and when I’m done paying the bills, I probably have $48 and go buy hygiene products,"" Fayne said. ""And they send me $75 worth of food stamps which lasts up until this time of the month and then you got things you don’t have. Like, in our refrigerator we have chicken and no other meat. We have like four packs of chicken and we’re going to try and make it stretch until the end of the month.”

In the Mississippi Delta, 26 percent of people are food insecure. There aren’t a lot of grocery stores in the area and Fayne says high grocery prices prevent him from buying certain foods.

“I come and pick up a box and bring it back to the house, and it helps me quite a bit because sometimes we don’t have the other items in there, especially the cereal and the fruit. We don’t have the money to buy it.”

Inside, the volunteers fill the boxes with crackers, cookies and canned goods. The final touch added to the boxes is the meat, which today is chicken and turkey.

Jimmy Pegues says he does all he can so the food he gets lasts.

""We cook about three times a week, and other time we eat sandwiches or whatever,"" he said. ""I’m not a real big eater. I try not to waste it, we try not to waste food. Cook what you need and that’s it.”

Pegues lost his leg in an accident over 30 years ago and today he's a gardener — or as his business card says, a yard doctor.

He is one of the last to get his box of food, but signing up ahead of time will guarantee you will receive a box.

And once everyone who signed up has their box, the rest of the food is given away on a first come, first served basis.

Weeks of widespread flooding and severe weather have left many Delta residents displaced from their homes. Jeanette Jones said this has increased the demand for more food from the pantry.

“A lot of people don’t have anything,"" Jones said. ""Their house was gutted, you know, no food…and we’re planning on giving extra.”

After nearly three hours of distributing food, Joe Young announces the pantry has run out of food for the first time.

“We had such an overwhelming crowd,"" Young said. ""We were understaffed, under everything”.

Twenty-six people add their names and numbers to a waiting list before they leave to receive their boxes of food later in the week.

A soft-spoken woman named Glenda Miller comes in as the volunteers are cleaning up. She is told the pantry is out of food. But as she is about to leave, someone inside the pantry flags her down after finding extra food.

“I jumped out the car and came in here, and it was a blessing…blessing,"" she said. ""She had meat. I got chicken. I got beans, I got rice. I got practically everything I need. Thank God…God is good.”

Miller has three grandchildren and says she doesn’t know where she would have gotten food.

“It’s been quite a while since I’ve been here because I had a heart attack, so I hadn’t been able to get out to get my stuff. After I had this heart attack a couple of months, and when I finally made it here, I was just happy. Because they had stuff for me and my grandkids.”

Joe Young says although the pantry is open only once a month, he says his job of feeding Tallahatchie County goes beyond just those few hours on a Saturday. Young said they keep their cellphones by their sides day and night — ready to distribute food to anyone in need.

""I’m not sure if we’re prepared, But we’re always trying to be proactive…to be ready,"" Young said.

And while the volunteers are done for the day, they already have distributions set up for the upcoming week to help residents in need.","MPB’s Alexandra Watts spends a day in a food pantry to see what happens when demand is larger than supply.

115,"Jun 10, 2020",Mississippi Today,How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemic,"‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemic

June 10, 2020

When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

“It wasn’t, ‘Oh my gosh how are we going to teach these kids?’ It was, ‘Oh my gosh these kids are going to starve without these meals,’” said Sunny Baker, co-director of the Mississippi Farm to School Network.

Before coronavirus, schools were a dependable place for thousands of children to receive a free and nutritious breakfast and lunch. The pandemic made this service even more crucial, as school buildings closed this spring and the virus wreaked havoc on the state and the nation’s economy, putting many parents’ jobs and economic futures in peril.

In Mississippi, 75 percent of children qualify for free or reduced meals, which means they live in households with income levels between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line. Because of this, the majority of children are dependent on the free breakfast and lunch they get at school everyday. When schools abruptly closed, so did that food supply.

“We just have such a large population in Mississippi of students who depend on those meals,” said Scott Clements, state director of child nutrition at the Mississippi Department of Education. “That breakfast and that lunch is the most nutritious meal they’ll get and in some cases, the only meal they’ll get during the course of the day.”

Gov. Tate Reeves made the decision to close school buildings and switch to distance learning on March 19, which means most school districts sprung into action immediately upon their return from spring break.

In the weeks since, school nutrition departments have had to pivot to alternative methods to ensure students receive food, whether it be a grab-and-go format, school bus door stop delivery, or drive-up exchanges.

More than 4.65 million meals have been served from mid-March through April (May figures are not available yet), Clements said. On any given day during the academic year, more than 100 school districts offered grab-and-go meals at more than 350 sites, not counting the 14 nonprofits that served meals at an additional 53 sites. Schools are still serving during the summer; the number of districts and sites change daily, as schools are constantly making decisions about which locations and days of the week to continue serving while also keeping workers and families safe.

“We say that all the time during the course of the school year, we really love to see a child eat breakfast in the morning because they’re better prepared to learn that day,” Clements said. “We like to see them eat lunch because they’re not going to be hungry and distracted in the afternoon. The same goes for right now — we’re trying to do distance learning and I think it’s important to make sure the nutrition is right so that they are healthy and even though (learning) shifted to home, they’re still able to learn.”

In some cases, local school districts have stopped serving meals because of the coronavirus. The West Bolivar School District, for example, paused delivery for about a month for this reason. They were delivering meals to students along the bus route in an effort to reach kids in the most rural areas of the county. But when one of the food service staff contracted the coronavirus, the meal provisions had to stop immediately, said Jackie Lloyd, school board president.

Small towns that West Bolivar School District served like Shaw — where the only sources of food are one restaurant, two gas stations, and a Dollar General — were suddenly left to figure out how to bridge the gap of keeping kids fed.

“You go to [Dollar General] one day, the shelves are just bare. It’s a whole community of people trying to get the small amount that’s available. So it’s very hard for them, especially our elderly, to be able to survive and get adequate nutrition that they need during this time,” said Cora Jackson, who was born and raised in Shaw.

In Shaw’s case, the nonprofit Delta Hands for Hope stepped in.

“Delta Hands for Hope has been a pillar in Shaw for the past five to six years. Because our focus is on youth, there’s no way that I could not do something for these children,” said Chiquikta Fountain, executive director and sole employee of Delta Hands for Hope.

From Day One volunteers like Jackson, her husband, and a group of students showed up to assemble meals. Donors contributed money and meal boxes toward the effort. Delta Hands for Hope, which before the pandemic provided children with educational resources after school, now serves lunch to around 65 kids three days a week. Even with these efforts, they’re still not able to reach all of the children in Shaw who are enrolled in West Bolivar School District.

While the need for a reliable, nutritious food source has become a glaring issue during the time of this pandemic, the problem of food insecurity is not new.

“Food pantries are an emergency solution to a huge problem here. They’re a Band-Aid. All of this hunger talk and hunger work to me is going to be for naught if we’re not talking about changing the system in which hunger exists,” Baker, the co-director of Mississippi Farm to School Network, said.

That system in which hunger exists hinges on long-held economic policies that don’t promote the buying and selling of locally grown produce.

Mississippi’s agricultural “focus on export commodities appears to have led state officials, and educational institutions, to overlook the potential for creating new economic activity — and farm and food business ownership — through local foods,” states a report produced for the Mississippi Food Policy Council.

The same report estimates that Mississippi imports nearly 90 percent of its food, while exporting on a large scale commodity crops that have to be processed, like soybeans.

“We have this incredibly rich soil. The Mississippi Delta is the richest soil in the country. And we’re not growing food there. We’re growing commodity crops — stuff that people can’t eat,” Baker said. “We’re not supporting small scale farmers. In fact, there are many policies and legislation that prevent small farmers from doing what they need to do.”

This is just one of the factors contributing to what is commonly referred to as hunger in Mississippi. In this sense, hunger doesn’t necessarily mean starving to death. It means not knowing where the next meal will come from or not being able to access healthy, affordable food.

“There are people here who may not be starving like we see on TV where you have children who are malnourished. Starvation looks a different way. Having access to food looks totally different than what you think it does … There’s food, but it’s processed food. You may even have cooked food (from a gas station or restaurant), but you don’t know where that came from,” Fountain said.

Eddye Johnson, food service director in the Coahoma County School District, is also well aware of this problem. She knew it would be hard for students to get a nutritious meal — her concerns stemmed from the lack of healthy meals students eat rather than access to the food itself.

“A lot of these children can’t go in there and cook, so they might be hungry or eating (Ramen) noodles up until their parents come home. Every now and then I think about that. I try to do my best to make sure I do all I can to make sure each child gets a decent meal and something nutritious,” Johnson said.

On a statewide level, the department of education worked with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to secure additional funding for families. The Pandemic EBT Program (P-EBT) was passed by the federal government in March as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and gives the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture the authority to approve statewide plans for temporary assistance to ensure that “children continue to have access to nutritious meals despite this national emergency.”

To date, 41 states have been approved, Mississippi included. The program serves 340,980 students to the tune of $90 million, or about $5.40 per student per day. The funding is retroactive, meaning it would cover the time from the date schools closed due to the pandemic (March 19) through the end of the school year (May 22).

The pandemic has also changed the way food is distributed. Ensuring the safety of employees and the greater communities they serve has led some districts to go from five days a week to one or two.

Cartons of milk for each child in some cases are now gallons, so families don’t have to come back repeatedly and increase contact and exposure. Before the virus, districts may have ordered large tins of canned peaches or strawberries; now they’re distributed in single-serve cups, Clements said.

“It’s a very different process from having 800 kids come through a serving line where you’re constantly being backfilled from the kitchen,” Clements, the state nutrition director, said. “Even though the numbers may be smaller, it’s tough to feed say, 400 kids in a serving line when you’ve got to bag up everything individually, have everything ready, keep it hot or cold as the case may be, outside of the kitchen.”

In the Jackson Public School District, meals were served at 12 sites across the city on Mondays and Wednesdays during the school year. Initially the district was serving Monday through Friday, but department officials decided it was best to stick to two days for the safety of everyone involved.

“Of course maintaining safety is always a concern,” said Marc Rowe, school nutrition director at the district. “It’s always a challenge to make sure that we’re all practicing social distancing and wearing all of our protective equipment.”

JPS is using a drive-up method, where parents pull up to the sites and workers hand them the bagged meals — two on Mondays and three on Wednesdays, so families have food for the week but don’t have to come by daily.

The state’s second largest school district typically serves about 19,000 lunches and 10,000 breakfasts a day during the school year.

“We know that because of those numbers, there is a major need for students to eat breakfast and lunch even though they’re not in a traditional school setting,” Rowe said.

Since mid-March when the governor closed schools to mid-May, Rowe said the district served roughly 125,000 meals. The district returned to Monday through Friday service on June 1 until June 10 for its summer feeding program.

The Coahoma County School District, which serves almost 1,200 students, delivered 1,200 breakfast and 1,200 lunches every day on Monday through Friday. The district ended their delivery meal services two weeks ago to prepare for their summer feeding program on June 1.

Maintaining employee safety is a challenge for all districts, but for some, trying to reach as many students as possible has been the biggest barrier of all.

Wilma McIntosh, food service director in the Clarksdale Municipal School District, said the stigma of the virus and rural areas the district serves are making it difficult to reach as many students.

“Even though the advertisement is out there and we’re encouraging everyone to come, some still don’t come. They may not have transportation and some they just may be fearful with coming out,” McIntosh said.

Clarksdale Municipal schools, Coahoma’s neighboring district, served grab-and-go meals — including breakfast and lunch — for five days a week. Across three sites, over 500 students received meals daily, McIntosh said.

But, this doesn’t equate to nearly half of the 3,000 students in the district. The district usually serves 525,000 meals per year.

As a way to reach more kids, the district implemented “Wildcat on Wheels,” bussing meals to students across the town. This one-day operation ended quickly for fear of the “safety for the community and employees,” McIntosh said.

Unlike schools, the issue for the Olive Branch Food Pantry, comprising more than 20 churches and organizations, wasn’t transportation. Michele McCrory, director, said their initial issue was finding volunteers. Their usual volunteers consisted of older people. Despite social distancing measures, they felt unsafe being around others, she said. As a result, the pantry closed in April.

“It was a hard decision for us. Many pantries opened during the COVID-19 scare. We have a couple of board members who are older or take care of elderly people, so they couldn’t get around people,” McCrory said.

The pantry secured younger volunteers and reopened in May operating as a drive through. They serve about 60 boxes every week to families.

In addition to food pantries, nonprofits and community organizations helped carry the load by giving monetary relief and helping hands for meal distribution.

In Tallahatchie County, The Tutwiler Community Education Center stepped in when the local school district couldn’t provide meals. Before the coronavirus, the organization’s role has always been to support the community in times of need.

“When the storm hit (earlier this year) and people lights were out and lost food, we were able to get a donation to get 10,000 gift cards for food to support that need and fortunately, we were able to partner with organizations,” Melanie Powell, executive director of the center, said.

This time is no different except for the increasing demand of food, she said. They are now doling out more than 250 food boxes per week. At this rate, Powell says the center “will be a food bank.”

Through it’s FEED fund, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi received over $150,000 to provide meals and food boxes to food pantries, church and community organizations, and food pantries. The Maddox Foundation of Hernando and the Walton Family Foundation gave over $100,000 to assist the foundation in its efforts.

While the pandemic has undoubtedly hindered people’s ability to access basic sustenance, it doesn’t mean that it has inflamed an overwhelming sense of despair in all.

“I don’t want to keep portraying our community like we don’t still have people who have pride in this place just because of something like this,” Fountain said. “People are resilient. They find ways to bounce back. Even in this time of confusion, I encounter people who have smiles on their faces, who are happy about life. They’re grateful to be here, even in the midst of all this stuff that’s going on.”","‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemicJune 10, 2020When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

McCabe: 'Absolutely nothing' will keep this from happening again

(CNN) —

A Republican running for governor in Mississippi denied a female reporter’s request to accompany him on a campaign trip unless she brought along a male colleague, insisting Wednesday that he did so because he “just wanted to keep things professional.”

The reporter, Larrison Campbell, wrote in Mississippi Today on Tuesday that the paper had asked to shadow each gubernatorial candidate seeking the GOP nomination “in an attempt to better inform readers.” While two of the candidates agreed, state Rep. Robert Foster declined, explaining on a Mississippi talk radio show Wednesday that having a female reporter with him could create “an awkward situation.”

Campbell, who said that she was the first to report on Foster’s plans to enter the gubernatorial race in November 2018, told CNN by phone Wednesday that she was in “disbelief” when Foster’s campaign manager, Colton Robinson, told her she wouldn’t be allowed to cover the campaign by herself.

“There really wasn’t any wiggle room, there was no getting around it,” she said. “I think it was like disbelief. I don’t think it was until I hung up that I got upset by it.”

Foster told SuperTalk Mississippi radio Wednesday, “It’s a ride-along request for a 16-hour day that we were going to be on the road. The other opponents of mine got a male reporter to ride along with them, which is a little bit different situation.

“In our case it was a female reporter asking to ride along, and my campaign director is in and out and gone sometimes – we have to divide and conquer – and there was just going to be a lot of opportunities where it would’ve been an awkward situation I didn’t want to put myself in.”

Foster also defended his decision on Twitter Wednesday, citing his Christian faith as the reason he denied access to Campbell.

“As I anticipated, the liberal left lost their minds over the fact I choose not to be alone with another woman,” he said. “They can’t believe, that even in 2019, someone still values their relationship with their wife and upholds their Christian Faith.”

Campbell said Wednesday it was uncomfortable for her, as a journalist, to be thrust into a story she was covering but, after Campell spoke with her editors, the paper decided to explain why Foster would get less coverage in Mississippi Today than the other GOP candidates.

“My job is to let the readers know what is happening in Mississippi,” she said. “I felt this was a service to our readers.”

Campbell added: “If it makes people angry, if it makes people fall in love with him, that’s besides the point. I sort of see this as a part of the public service of the job.”

Campbell also warned against the assumption that her denied access to Foster’s campaign is a “Mississippi story,” positing Wednesday that women everywhere are “sexualized” as they try to do their jobs.

“I don’t think this is a Mississippi story,” she said. “I think it’s a universal story.”

The Foster campaign did not respond to CNN’s request for comment Wednesday. His campaign website describes him as a “man of faith” and “conservative outsider.”

117,"May 26, 2019",TwinCities.com-Pioneer Press,Apartment proposal at former Island Station power plant promises Mississippi River access,"Ryan Swingruber said he has big plans for the former Island Station site in St. Paul, but not too big.

The 10-acre parcel of land bordering the Mississippi River near Shepard Road and Randolph Avenue has sat vacant since 2014, and previously was home to a coal-fired power plant decommissioned in the 1970s.

By September, he hopes to break ground on three and four stories of rental housing — a mix of micro, studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.

Working with a series of environmental consultants and architects, the Chicago-area developer drew up plans for 250 market-rate apartments, stepped back from the river.

Swingruber’s vision, set within a federal “Opportunity Zone,” calls for a multi-family housing complex that he said will increase rather than block river access.

Those plans include paved walking and biking paths to an inlet, a proposed public kayak launch and connections from the regional trail system along Randolph Avenue.

“From there, they’ll be able to traverse the peninsula,” said Swingruber, who has been meeting with Xcel Energy, which owns land on either side of the future development. “We want to make it public, with defined access and signage.”

The West 7th/Fort Road Federation voted to support the project’s conditional-use permit in March, but also included a letter to the city’s zoning committee raising two concerns. The federation sought deeper assurances the project would include improved public access to the river, and raised questions about the lack of affordable units.

“The Federation Board is being asked, once again, to support a market-rate housing project in our district,” said the letter, signed by board president Dana DeMaster. “We have a need for affordable housing, especially for families and for elderly persons, and this project proposal will not meet that need.”

She noted that the West Seventh neighborhood has among the highest average rents in St. Paul, and experienced a 17 percent increase in rental costs since 2010.

Real World Economics: A Texas-sized energy debacle Swingruber said he’s also met with the Friends of the Mississippi River and, in response to their concerns, the building height will drop from four to three stories nearest the riverfront.

“We’ve seen some past development proposals that haven’t gone anywhere,” said Colleen O’Connor Toberman, river corridor program director with Friends of the Mississippi River. “From what we’ve seen of the developer’s plans, there are some nice components of community access to the riverfront, and we do appreciate that aspect of the plan.”

ISLAND STATION BLOWN APART

The site was once home to the Island Station coal-based power plant, an unofficial St. Paul landmark that drew its share of cheers and jeers before it was blown to smithereens.

At St. Paul City Hall, efforts to declare the decommissioned 1920s-era power plant a local historic site deadlocked with a tie vote before the city council in 2013, sealing its fate. Developers literally exploded the iconic but decrepit structure the following March.

As the 280-feet-tall metal smokestack collapsed into debris, hopes for new residences, retailers and other fresh real estate gained some ground.

Fast forward five years, and no one has built anything. After nearly 45 years in limbo, however, the Island Station property has once again caught the eye of a prospective buyer.

Swingruber, a vice president with the Stoneleigh Cos. of Barrington, Ill., hopes to add housing to the site under the title Waterford Bay. This will be the first Twin Cities development for the company, which has apartment properties throughout Texas.

On Thursday, the St. Paul Planning Commission’s zoning committee reviewed a request from the Stoneleigh Cos. to construct the 45-feet-tall apartment complex. Anything above 35 feet triggers the need for a conditional-use permit.

In addition, the main entrance would be situated facing the river on the east side of the property, rather than in the third of the building closest to Randolph Avenue, as currently required.

The developer has also proposed a fire access road and storm sewers in the floodway plain, as well as variances for a front yard setback.

Swingruber said the building will be set back 100 feet from the river, rather than 50, as presently required, in respect for the proposed river setbacks in the city’s draft 2040 Comprehensive Plan. It will be three stories tall closest to the river, and four stories closer to Randolph Avenue, creating a stepped-back approach from the waterfront.

The “Traditional Neighborhood” or “T2” zoning would allow a maximum of 375 housing units, but Swingruber plans to build two-thirds as many units so as not to overwhelm the site.

Given the site’s history as a coal-fired plant, the project will require carefully addressing contaminated soils. Swingruber said he’s worked closely with environmental consultants Braun Intertec, design engineering consultants Kimley-Horn and architects with the BKV Group.

The site sits within a federally designated “Opportunity Zone,” which allows certain tax benefits for investors who hold onto properties for at least 10 years.

In an interview, city council member Rebecca Noecker said she looked forward to a briefing from St. Paul Planning and Economic Development.

FALSE STARTS

A previous developer, T.J. Hammerstrom, once planned 240 units of townhomes and condominiums on the site and in an adjoining eight-story building, which were never constructed.

In late 2014, after the power plant was demolished, Breckner River Development of Burnsville sold the site to Riverwalk of Scottsdale, Ariz., for $4.5 million.

119,"Sep 29, 2020",The Hill,It's now up to health systems to solve our food problems,"The whole world is getting fat,"" declared Whole Foods founder, John Mackey, in a recent interview with the New York Times. Because, he continues, ""in some sense, we are all food addicts."" Mackey explains that he does not think we have a food access problem, but rather a market demand problem. ""If people want different foods, the market will provide it.""

While this perspective ignores the rising wave of food insecurity across the nation, creates a false narrative of choice where there is often none and dismisses the complex relationship between food, obesity and trauma, we can't dismiss Mackey's comment outright.

He's right about one thing. He said: ""We have to recognize both what business can do and what business cannot do."" Stores like Whole Foods are unlikely to help households struggling to access healthy food. It's now up to health systems to play a significant role in solving our food problems.

Food insecurity is defined by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" Researchers estimate that during our spring COVID-19 surge, food insecurity rates doubled nationally and tripled in households with children; approximately 23 percent of households across the country currently have inadequate access to sustenance.

The relationship between COVID-19 and food insecurity is not merely that the former drives the latter. Food insecurity is associated with increased risk and poorer control of chronic diseases, which consistently have been shown to put individuals with COVID-19 infection at higher risk of complications and death. While chronic diseases have long been the leading drivers of premature death, COVID-19 takes all of our chronic diseases and makes them acute.

As with COVID-19 infection, the burden of food insecurity falls disproportionately on low-income and Black and Latinx households. Some of the highest rates of food insecurity are seen among undocumented immigrants; a recent MIRA survey found 78 percent of households with at least one undocumented family member did not have enough to eat.

Access to healthy foods is further restricted by food deserts, neighborhoods without grocery stores, and food swamps, neighborhoods saturated with fast food. To say this landscape is a result of the market disregards the policies that have stacked the deck towards our unhealthy food system: government subsidies for ingredients of processed, energy-dense foods such as corn, soybeans, dairy and livestock instead of fruits and vegetables. What we eat is impacted by availability and cost; decreasing these barriers changes our choices for the better.

Nutritional interventions can prevent, improve and even reverse chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Diet is one of the most important modifiable risk factors of chronic non-communicable disease, according to the WHO. This is why simply put, food is medicine. Acknowledging food insecurity's outsized role in driving poor nutrition and chronic disease necessitates prioritizing healthy food access for all in our response to our worsening food insecurity crisis.

Increasingly, we understand that trauma influences our food and our health. Last summer, a friend of mine became a vegetarian. That same summer, a family member of hers was murdered. Sitting under a large umbrella at a work pool party, we talked about how she was doing. ""Not great,"" she admitted, waving her hamburger with one hand. ""I feel anxious all the time. And as you can see, my vegetarianism is out the window. I just… crave meat.""

In the setting of the COVID pandemic, we can all likely readily agree that stress influences our bodies and food cravings. And chronic trauma and stress, particularly during childhood, has a lasting influence on our neurobiology, stress hormones, food choices and weight. Increasingly, research recognizes a significant link between adverse childhood events (ACEs) and a range of chronic medical conditions including obesity. For these patients, offering a nutritional intervention alone is insensitive and will not work.

Health systems are well poised to play a strategic part in fixing our food problems due to their proximity to communities, central responsibility in treating chronic disease, the inclusion of mental health and participation in value-based payment models that incentivize addressing patients' health-related social needs such as food.

Masshealth, the Medicaid insurance product for low-income individuals in Massachusetts, has created one of the first programs to allow health systems to partner with social service organizations and provide nutritional interventions — i.e. healthy food — on their dollar with its 149 million dollar Flexible Services Program.

Health systems ready to incorporate nutritional interventions can reference the Food is Medicine pyramid, created by Food is Medicine MA, which provides a helpful schema of evidence-based programs.

For example, nutritious food referrals, which provide vouchers for free or discounted nutrient-dense food, have been shown to improve fruit and vegetable intake, improve diabetic control and improve Body Mass Index. The most intensive program, medically tailored meals, provides prepared meals tailored to a patient's medical conditions. Medically tailored meals have been shown to reduce ED visits by 70 percent, reduce inpatient hospital admissions by 50 percent and to reduce net healthcare costs by 14 percent.

Some may say it is not in scope for health systems to provide food for their patients. But the persistent long lines at food pantries and rise of community fridges are clear indications that we need more widespread solutions. As Congress has demonstrated by failing to renew Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, our government will not provide solutions anytime soon. Public assistance programs such as WIC, SNAP and school lunches are helpful but insufficient; eligibility and authorization requirements pose barriers to enrollment, particularly for immigrant populations.

Health systems are already increasingly harnessing available resources to tackle food insecurity for their communities. A trauma-informed food is medicine approach that has the power to transform our disease-oriented system into a health system; it's time we fully embrace it.

Wed, 10/14/2020 - 11:18am | By: Van Arnold

The historic Covid-19 pandemic has created an increased need for donations to The University of Southern Mississippi’s Eagle’s Nest food pantry located on the Hattiesburg campus.

In response to that dilemma, a trio of University organizations – Sigma Alpha Lambda, Association of Office Professionals and Staff Council – united to generate awareness of the pantry’s plight. Over the past several months, the groups have become directly involved in collecting and delivering contributions for the pantry.

“We could not have maintained the pantry operations without the assistance of these organizations,” said Eagle’s Nest Adviser Dr. Tamara Hurst, associate professor in USM’s School of Social Work. “They worked with us throughout the summer and into the fall. Members worked in the pantry and delivered food to students who were unable to come to campus. The pantry relies on community support and volunteers to stay open. It means everything to us to receive this support.”

Located in the basement of The Hub on the Hattiesburg campus, The Eagle’s Nest provides food, hygiene items, school supplies and other assorted products to students and staff. Only a current Southern Miss identification card is needed to access the pantry.

Hurst notes that the pantry’s primary needs include shelf-stable items such as dried or canned beans, rice, fruits, vegetables and meats.

“We always welcome fresh fruits, vegetables and bread,” said Hurst. “Gently-used cookware and eating utensils are always in demand, particularly with student in off-campus apartments.”

Since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted across the country in March, the Eagle’s Nest has experienced an increased demand from staff and international students, in particular. Jennifer Lewis, Assistant Director of Compliance and Ethics at USM, serves as the Vice President for Community Service for Sigma Alpha Lambda. She is also an Eagle’s Nest board member. Lewis says the relentless pandemic has produced immense strain on charity venues such as the Eagle’s Nest.

“In these unprecedented times, we are concerned that our most vulnerable populations, i.e. some of our staff whose spouses may not have been able to return to work or missed work during earlier quarantine phases are playing catch-up and our students, especially our international students who cannot work off-campus continue to suffer from food insecurity due to the period of time during which they were not able to work on campus,” said Lewis.

122,"Jul 6, 2020",Save the Children,Underlying Disparities Mean Mississippi’s Kids Are Hit Hard by COVID 19,"Underlying Disparities Mean Mississippi’s Kids Are Hit Hard by COVID-19

Childhood should be a time when our nation’s youngest citizens develop into the adults who will care for and lead our country, our world, and our shared future. Every child deserves love, care and protection so they can develop to their full potential. Yet for millions of children in the United Sates – and hundreds of millions more children around the world – childhood is ending too soon.

In its 2020 U.S. Complement to the Global Childhood Report, Save the Children takes a closer look at the major reasons why childhoods are ending too soon as measured by five factors. The End of Childhood State Ranking shows which states are succeeding, and which ones are failing, to provide conditions that nurture and protect children, including 5-year-old Khloe’s home state of Mississippi.

Sadly, Mississippi is the second-worst state for children in the nation. The state has the nation’s highest rate of children dying before their first birthday: 8.5 deaths per 1,000 live births– well above the national average of 5.6.

The coronavirus pandemic has made these inequalities all the more stark.

For the millions of families like Khloe’s, the effects of this pandemic on their ability to access food, healthcare, and basic services can be crippling and even deadly. Khloe’s grandmother, Sharon, says it’s been hard to keep the Kindergartener motivated to do her school assignments.

“Why did this happen? When is COVID going to leave,” she asks her grandmother.

Lack of food has also been a problem for families where Khloe and her grandmother live in Bolivar County, especially those who relied on school lunches. In fact, 30 million children in the U.S. depend on school for one or more of their meals each week.

At the beginning of the stay-at-home order, Khloe’s school district gave out “grab-and-go” lunches, but later they stopped the service out of concern for staff safety.

In nearby Coahoma and Quitman counties, parents and grandparents who have lost jobs and child care services said they felt “stressed,” “overwhelmed” and “anxious.” They described their children as “confused,” “lonely” and “depressed.”

“It’s hard to keep food in the home because of unemployment,” said Kimberly, a mother of two teenagers who lost her job when the nearby casino was closed.","Underlying Disparities Mean Mississippi’s Kids Are Hit Hard by COVID-19Childhood should be a time when our nation’s youngest citizens develop into the adults who will care for and lead our country, our world, and our shared future.

124,"Sep 15, 2020",Food & Wine,Fannie Lou Hamer's Pioneering Food Activism Is a Model for Today,"Food systems in the United States are in turmoil. What little progress the country has made on race relations and combating police brutality is crumbling before us. In many ways, the United States today doesn’t look much different than it did when voting and women’s rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was fighting against those same injustices with her Food Farm Cooperative. Until her death in 1977, Hamer, who co-founded the Freedom Democratic Party and National Women’s Political Caucus, used food as a political weapon to protest against systemic oppression.

Established in 1967, the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC) was an act of resistance. The idea was to provide African Americans with a path to economic opportunity and access to nutritious food that had been systematically denied to them due to white power structures. The United States Department of Agriculture routinely rejected African-American farmers’ loans for land, or imposed other policies that caused African-American farmers to lose their land, nationwide. As a result, many were forced to become sharecroppers or do other forms of low-wage work to survive. This was just one of many examples of the federal government intentionally preventing African Americans from attaining wealth or a living wage during the Jim Crow era. Over the past century, Black farmers lost approximately 12 million acres of farmland in the Delta area alone. It is estimated that 6 million of those acres were lost between 1950 to 1964.

Located in Ruleville, Mississippi, in rural Sunflower County, Hamer's Freedom Farm Cooperative and pig bank was part of a larger plan to address the increasing poverty faced by area residents. “I think there was a lot of respect for her, especially when she started working with white folks and the word got out that she didn’t give a damn who you were, if your children were hungry, you could be involved,” said Reverend Jeff Goldstein, a community organizer, and activist who worked with Hamer on Mississippi Delta grassroots civil rights movements.

Thanks to the help of singer and activist Harry Belafonte and the charitable group Measure for Measure in Madison, Wisconsin, Hamer was able to purchase the initial 40 acres in Sunflower County to create the FFC. “If you give a hungry man food, he will eat it,” Hamer said. “[But] if you give him land, he will grow his own food.”

The FFC had three main goals: addressing and enriching the nutritional needs of African Americans; creating access to affordable housing; and fostering entrepreneurship opportunities. In exchange for a few hours of work, families could take home a bushel of produce from the farm. This allowed over 1,500 families to sustain themselves by growing cash crops and vegetables such as snap peas, butter beans, squash, peas, and cucumbers. It also further reinforced the idea that the person who owns the land owns the food.

Hamer ensured affordable housing on the land with the construction of 200 homes, some of which are still standing today in Ruleville. Via the FFC, she provided financial assistance to thousands of rural people from Mississippi to purchase homes with running water and heat, which was previously inaccessible to much of the county’s population. Cash crops such as cotton and soybeans were grown to pay for taxes and overhead. Families were charged one dollar per month to use the service. This nominal fee was so much of a burden for many that only 30 families could afford it. Hamer believed that FFC's collective land ownership meant control of the food and would bring them a step closer to political freedom

FFC was also home to a Head Start program, commercial kitchen, community gardens, and a garment factory that assisted African Americans who had been fired and/or evicted for exercising their right to vote. Sharecroppers and tenant farmers alike were afforded education and retraining opportunities in healthcare and disaster relief.

With many of Sunflower's residents trying to flee racism and the prejudices of the Jim Crow South, the FFC opened the door to self-sufficiency. The region was also suffering from a continued population loss to the North, Midwest, and West as a result of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which triggered the Great Migration. Starvation was one of many strategies used to prevent African Americans from voting. Policies enforced by Mississippi congressman Jamie Whitten of the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee worked counter to the USDA’s efforts to bring more food programs to the state. Hindering marginalized people from access to these programs further exacerbated malnutrition in the state. This was clearly in retaliation for Hamer and people like her who continued to register and encourage African Americans to vote.

Continued oppression from politicians and racism forced many African Americans to leave their low wage domestic and agricultural jobs and seek employment in northern cities. Landowners made rent so high for sharecroppers and tenant farmers that most were barely surviving. African American workers had to choose between their right to vote and their existence. Exercising their right to vote meant paying for grossly expensive tests that were often financially out of reach, losing employment, and in some cases risking bodily harm or death.

The promise of better living conditions, educational and employment opportunities, as well as the widespread transition away from manual labor and towards more sophisticated farming, lured many Southerners to northern cities and west to California. The transition to farm machinery was also a driving force after generations of exploiting African Americans for their skilled labor.

FFC's collective model was a threat to the existing white hierarchy and the political and economic control that kept African American residents in poverty. This cooperative approach helped to stave off a second wave of migration to the North. It allowed African Americans who wished to remain in the Mississippi Delta a chance to create a healthy community with access to an alternative food system.

A year after the creation of the FFC, Hamer purchased another 640 acres, and the pig bank was born. Thanks to a donation from the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), Hamer was able to buy five male pigs, Jersey boars, and 50 female pigs, Yorkshire gilts. To welcome the pigs, she threw a party complete with dancing, eating, singing, and handshaking. Hamer believed that as long as people had a pig, they would not starve to death.

The Sunflower Pigs, as they were called, were delivered to a breeding barn built by local women who were often the more experienced farmers and had the skills to manage the farm. The gilts were loaned out to families where they would return piglets to the bank as interest. These families would butcher the pigs once they reached an acceptable weight.

This allowed families to go upwards of a year without purchasing store-bought ham and lard from the nearby plantation commissary. By its second year, 100 families had slaughtered pigs, frozen meat, and roasted pork. This brought a sense of pride and was a confirmation of the resilience of the Black women and men who were responsible for steering this initiative.

Despite having the help of civil rights activists, celebrities, and non-profit organizations, the FFC began to fall apart in 1974. The cooperative didn't have a strong framework to realize its long term potential and fulfill its promise. Donors became frustrated due to lack of acknowledgement, and eventually, partner organizations such as the NCNW withdrew their support. The farm wasn't financially stable, even though it was feeding and nourishing the community. In 1976, due to Hamer's fading health from breast cancer and increasing financial strain, the FFC was shuttered.","In many ways, the United States today doesn’t look much different than it did when voting and women’s rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was fighting against those same injustices with her Food Farm Cooperative.

OXFORD, Miss. – As University of Mississippi students resume classes for the spring semester, they are sharing the campus’ sidewalks with a fleet of robots that can deliver meals at the push of a button.

Starship Technologies, the world’s leading autonomous delivery service, has launched robot food delivery services at the university, the first in the Southeastern Conference to have autonomous delivery robots.

Beginning today (Jan. 22), Ole Miss students, faculty and staff can access the Starship Deliveries app (iOS and Android) to order food and drinks to be delivered anywhere on campus, within minutes from any of the 30 robots serving UM. The service will work in conjunction with student meal plans.

“Ole Miss Dining is focused on the continued utilization of advanced technology to enrich the student, faculty and staff dining experience,” said Chip Burr, resident district manager of Ole Miss Dining Services. “We are excited about the expansion of our mobile ordering operation and the new opportunities this partnership creates.”

By making food and drink more accessible, the Starship robots save time and reduce stress, aiming to make the busy lives of the Ole Miss community a little easier, Burr said.

Items can be ordered from Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, McAlister’s, Panda Express, Which Wich, Qdoba, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Raising Cane’s, Steak ‘n Shake, Freshii, Papa John’s and Sambazon. After choosing their items, users select their location by dropping a pin on the campus map where they want their food delivered.

The app allows users to watch the robot’s journey in real time through an interactive map. Once the robot arrives, the user will receive an alert and can meet the robot and unlock it through the app.

The delivery usually takes just minutes, depending on the menu items ordered and the distance the robot must travel. The robots can carry up to 20 pounds.

Starship Technologies operates commercially on a daily basis around the world. Its robots have traveled more than 350,000 miles and completed some 100,000 autonomous deliveries.

The robots use a combination of sophisticated machine learning, artificial intelligence and sensors to travel on sidewalks and navigate around obstacles. The computer vision-based navigation helps the robots to map their environment to the nearest inch. They can cross streets, climb curbs, travel at night and operate in both rain and snow.

A team of humans also can monitor their progress remotely and take control if needed.

“We’re honored to be able to help make lives a little bit easier for Rebels across the Ole Miss campus by offering the world’s leading autonomous delivery service” said Ryan Tuohy, senior vice president of business development at Starship. “Whether it’s getting breakfast delivered in the morning or having a late-night snack, our robots are here to serve students, faculty and staff at all times of the day.”","Starship Technologies, the world’s leading autonomous delivery service, has launched robot food delivery services at the university, the first in the Southeastern Conference to have autonomous delivery robots.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched a two-year online purchasing pilot in April 2019 and, in January of this year, only residents in New York and Washington states could benefit.

Fast-forward less than six months, and now residents who rely on SNAP benefits — once known as ""food stamps"" — can shop online for their groceries in 36 states and Washington, D.C.

Amazon has been one of the retailers working with the USDA for quick implementation.

Amazon customers can shop for grocers across three services — Amazon Grocery, Amazon Pantry and Amazon Fresh — with EBT (electronic benefit transfer) payment and free shipping. Amazon has also waived the Prime membership requirement for SNAP customers to access Amazon Fresh, meaning that they can choose from fresh produce and meat where available.

The 36 states where SNAP recipients can use their benefits through Amazon are Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, along with the District of Columbia.

“We are expanding new flexibilities and innovative programs to make sure Americans across this country have safe and nutritious food during this national emergency,” said Sonny Perdue, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. “Enabling people to purchase foods online will go a long way in helping Americans follow CDC social-distancing guidelines and help slow the spread of the coronavirus. USDA is mandated with the noble goal of feeding Americans when they need it most, and we are fulfilling that mission with new innovative programs during this national emergency.”

127,"Oct 29, 2019",WCBI,Some communities in Mississippi struggle with food deserts,"SHUQUALAK, Miss. (WCBI) – According to Feeding America, 1 in 5 Mississippians is struggling with hunger.

For some, grocery stores are far away, and farmer’s markets are nonexistent. But there are things communities can do to help.

Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible. In Mississippi, Dr. Kenya Cistrunk said nearly every county has pockets of desert areas.

“So when you think about Mississippi, and how rural our state is then you obviously we have to acknowledge that there are some areas that will not have access to supermarkets. How do we make sure that people who are in those areas have access to healthy food options,” said Cistrunk?

Some retailers are changing their business models – expanding into rural areas and offering some grocery options.

“Just to have something right here to grab bread, eggs, household, it means the world we are grateful to have the Dollar General here,” said Shirley Moore Blakley.

But even though these stores have some benefits, they also pose some challenges.

“When you think about someone who’s hungry and trying to get food, if I can get to Dollar General and purchase that frozen meal or the canned food at a price that works with my budget, then at least it gets me something. Where we want to get people to understand that those might not be the healthiest options and how do we help them learn those skills and techniques that they may not know, to grow their own vegetables and fruit,” said Cistrunk.

Cistrunk said it will take a broader approach to help those facing food insecurity.

“We’re talking about from a community level, not just individuals but from a community, level addressing food insecurity, through the community gardens, through the community-supported agricultural a model. Where people can purchase, you know food bags, if they have the funds or use their EBT benefits to go to the farmers market to be able to purchase the foods that they need,” said Cistrunk.

573,610 Mississippians experienced food insecurity in 2017 according to feeding America. While that number is high, it down nearly 100,000 from 2015.","- Advertisement -Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible.

128,"Oct 16, 2019",Mississippi Today,"Ole Miss, MSU meal plan prices skyrocket as contractor Aramark pays for new facilities","The Labor of Food: Inside campus dining at the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University

The State of Campus Dining: For 2019, the Southern Foodways Alliance (SFA), an institute of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, has explored the labor of food through symposia, films, podcasts, and other media. The SFA collaborated with AL.com, the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today to produce interlocked stories. Together, they shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi — the largest public universities in Alabama and Mississippi.

by Aallyah Wright for Mississippi Today and Luke Ramseth for Mississippi Clarion Ledger | October 16, 2019

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food. Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an “unlimited” meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal “swipes” didn’t roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).”

Glasper isn’t alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

“Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,” said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and the The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State’s operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

But contractors eventually ran out of “ways to distinguish themselves on the service side” when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

“Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it.” — Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12% commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn’t reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a “campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations, and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan “is much, much more expensive” than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won’t use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,” Mac Dermott said of meal options. “They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a “food-court environment” where managers can “interchange menu concepts very easily,” said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands, such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.”

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into an “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

“Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,” said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. “They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they’re going to have access to (at home).”

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but “we’ve adjusted” to student demand. “Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there’s going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the “Ultimate” plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren’t using the rising prices to “pad the pocket of the institution.” She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshman are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 “Rebel Unlimited Plus 1” plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract “to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,” said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar “Dining Dollars” food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama’s contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid, such as Pell Grants, don’t always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,” Grant said. “But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

Johnson Commons, at the University of Mississippi Monday, October 7, 2019. Credit: Eric J. Shelton/Mississippi Today, Report For America

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefit packages, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there…” Eventually, it was “ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.” — Joshua Taylor, former Ole Miss athletics cook

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks, impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,” Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017. “I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,” he said. “We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

These stories ask questions about worker compensation and benefits, university revenue models, and the relationship between universities and the corporate food service provider Aramark. On October 25, during the Southern Foodways Symposium on the University of Mississippi campus, reporters from the project will discuss their findings.

131,"Dec 20, 2019",Jackson Free Press,City to Provide 500 Meals to Jackson Children Over Holidays,"Several local nonprofits will unite this holiday season to provide 500 free meals to young people in Jackson as part of ongoing efforts to fight food insecurity in the city and state, which currently ranks first nationwide in food insecurity.

On Dec. 23, the Jackson Meals Matter program team up with Chefs for the Culture and the Love JXN: Save Ourselves campaign to cook and distribute hot meals at the Grove Park Community Center in northwest Jackson. The event, titled ""Holiday Meals for Jackson's Kids,"" will begin at 11 a.m. and end at 2 p.m.

As the poorest state in America, food insecurity is especially profound in Mississippi. Approximately 600,840 Mississippians, or one in four people, do not have access to enough food. One-quarter of children in the state and more than half of Mississippi's elderly population go to sleep hungry.

In Hinds County alone, 61,720 people go without enough food. As the Mississippi Food Network points out, the food-insecure population of Hinds County is larger than the hungry population in all of North Dakota.

Food insecurity is linked to numerous adverse health effects. For children, lack of access to nutrient-rich foods can lead to developmental problems and poor educational outcomes. Because unhealthy foods tend to be cheaper than nutrient-rich ones, families who are struggling to make ends meet are more likely to consume foods that harm their physical health. And since families must often decide between placing food on the table or meeting their other basic needs, food insecurity has also been linked to housing and transportation insecurity and lack of access to medical care.

Summers and holiday vacations are particularly difficult times for families struggling with food insecurity, as school breakfasts and lunches are the only times that a child may eat during the day. Mississippi ranks 47th in the country for child participation in school summer lunch programs, the Food Research and Action Center reports. Only 8% of Mississippi kids ages 18 and younger are currently enrolled in summer lunch programs.

The average cost of a meal in Mississippi is $2.93, the nonprofit Feeding America found. The agency estimates that an additional $286,997,000 in funds is required to overhaul food insecurity in Mississippi.

In 2018, the City of Jackson received a $120,000 grant from the National League of Cities to combat hunger. The City used the money to launch the Jackson Meals Matter program.

132,"Jul 3, 2019",Vox,Mississippi is forbidding grocery stores from calling veggie burgers “veggie burgers”,"It’s been a good few months for the plant-based meat movement — so good that opponents of the fledgling industry are starting to mobilize.

This week, a new law went into effect in Mississippi. The state now bans plant-based meat providers from using labels like “veggie burger” or “vegan hot dog” on their products. Such labels are potentially punishable with jail time. Words like “burger” and “hot dog” would be permitted only for products from slaughtered livestock. Proponents claim the law is necessary to avoid confusing consumers — but given that the phrase “veggie burger” hasn’t been especially confusing for consumers this whole time, it certainly seems more like an effort to keep alternatives to meat away from shoppers.

“The plant-based meat alternative category is on fire right now, with consumers demanding healthier and more sustainable options,” Michele Simon, the executive director of the Plant-Based Foods Association, said in a statement. “This law, along with similar laws in several other states, is the meat lobby’s response.”

The makers of meat alternatives are suing. In a lawsuit filed on July 2, they argue that since their products are already labeled “vegan,” no consumers are confused. If anything, the requirement that they avoid product descriptions like “veggie burger” makes things more confusing.

“There is no evidence that consumers are confused by plant-based bacon or veggie burger labels, and federal laws are already in place that prohibits consumer deception,” said Jessica Almy, director of policy at the Good Food Institute, an organization that works on expanding access to plant-based foods. “This law is a tremendous overstep of state powers.”

And that’s not the only problem. Food scientists are working right now on cell-based meat products, which are identical to meat from animals but grown from stem cells in a factory. Those products (which aren’t on the market yet) are meat in every relevant sense — most importantly, anyone with an allergy to meat will experience an allergic reaction to the products, and the items must be stored, refrigerated, and handled as meat. But under Mississippi’s current law, it’d be illegal to disclose that on the label.

This legal fight matters. Labeling laws like these have been discussed around the country, and courts will soon debate whether they’re constitutional. At the same time, federal regulators are looking to the states for cues about labeling laws for plant-based meat. Aggressive prohibitions could slow the growth of plant-based alternatives, which are badly needed.

The plant-based meat backlash is here

“This bill will protect our cattle farmers from having to compete with products not harvested from an animal,” said Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation president Mike McCormick in January when the bill passed in the Mississippi state House.

Mississippi isn’t the first state to consider this. Missouri passed the first such labeling law last year, and it was challenged in court by groups including the Good Food Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that such a “content-based, overbroad, and vague” restriction on the language companies could use to describe their products was unconstitutional. The lawsuit is now in settlement talks.

Dozens of other states have considered similar laws since then. The laws are popular with farmers and ranchers, who see their business model threatened by the rising popularity of plant-based meat.

That backlash might seem premature. While plant-based meat is certainly rising in popularity, all plant-based meat products still account for only a tiny fraction of the demand for meat. And plant-based alternatives aren’t changing the meat industry yet: Demand for meat actually grew last year.

But plant-based meat advocates hope — and sellers of conventional meat fear — that someday, that might change. A more climate-conscious population is increasingly bothered by the carbon footprint and land use problems associated with conventional meat production, and economies of scale may enable plant-based meat alternatives to be more competitive on price. While that day is far off, and still quite speculative, the possibility has clearly spurred lobbyists to action.

The free speech argument

But is that action constitutional? Past court decisions suggest it might not be.

Federal laws prohibit labeling food in ways that are deceptive to consumers. You can’t call a product gluten-free if it isn’t, of course, or call it “olive oil” if it’s not made from olives. When laws have tried to push beyond that, they’ve generally met a skeptical audience in the courts.

In a California case, the courts ruled that a claim that terms like “soy milk” and “almond milk” would confuse consumers was nonsense. “The crux of the claims is that a reasonable consumer might confuse plant-based beverages such as soymilk or almond milk for dairy milk, because of the use of the word “milk,” the USDistrict Court for the Northern District of California wrote, dismissing the case. “The claim stretches the bounds of credulity. Under Plaintiffs’ logic, a reasonable consumer might also believe that veggie bacon contains pork, that flourless chocolate cake contains flour, or that e-books are made out of paper.”

A Florida case directly examined free speech rights as they apply to food labels. Skim milk is routinely fortified with vitamin A (which prevents blindness, and which is removed in the skimming process). A law in Florida prohibited producers of milk and milk products from selling their products if the vitamin A was left out, demanding that milk without added vitamin A be called “imitation skim milk.” A small Florida milk producer sued, arguing that their product was skim milk and that they should have the right to label it that way. The courts sided with the milk producer.

Does it even make sense to say that a creamery or Tofurky manufacturer has a right to free speech? The answer is yes. The First Amendment can be applied to commercial speech — though the law is a bit complicated. In the 1940s, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there were no First Amendment protections for purely commercial speech. By the 1970s, the Court had reconsidered that, and overturned it in 1976.

In 1980, the Court supplied the rules for First Amendment protections on commercial speech that are still applied today. Those rules are called the “Central Hudson” test, because they were laid out in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company v. Public Service Commission of New York.

Here are the rules: First, commercial speech “must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.” Supporters of Mississippi’s law might argue that the term “plant-based burger” is misleading, while opponents argue that consumers know perfectly well what a veggie burger is.

“There’s nothing misleading about the name of a veggie burger, or vegan hot dog, or seitan bacon,” Almy, a lawyer on the Missouri case, told me. “The packages clearly disclose that this is plant-based food that has the taste or texture of this familiar food.”

Even if the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, the government can still regulate it. But it has to meet the following standards: The government must have a “substantial interest” at stake, the regulation must “directly and materially advance the government’s substantial interest,” and “the regulation must be narrowly tailored.”

There’s a strong case that bans on “veggie burger” and “tofu sausage” labels don’t meet this standard. “There’s considerable evidence that the motivation for this law is protecting cattle farmers from competition,” Almy told me. That wouldn’t be considered a substantial state interest, and banning not just words like “beef” and “pork” but also ones like “burger” and “sausage” runs a risk of the conclusion that the law isn’t narrowly tailored. “There are lots of ways to make sure that consumers are clear on what they’re buying without banning whole categories of words,” Almy pointed out.

If Mississippi’s law is found unconstitutional, that’ll be good news for consumers. There is no sign they’re being tricked by the increasing prominence of plant-based burgers — if anything, they often seem to be seeking them out.

The state now bans plant-based meat providers from using labels like “veggie burger” or “vegan hot dog” on their products.
If anything, the requirement that they avoid product descriptions like “veggie burger” makes things more confusing.
While plant-based meat is certainly rising in popularity, all plant-based meat products still account for only a tiny fraction of the demand for meat.

135,"Nov 30, 2018",,"City of Jackson, Mississippi, to Receive $1 Million Grant for Public Art","Jackson, Mississippi, is the latest city to be awarded a $1 million Public Art Challenge Grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization of former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Anchorage, Alaska, and Coral Springs, Florida, were also named as grant winners earlier this month.

The funds will support the project “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access,” which aims to inform policy related to nutrition by using art as a medium to communicate the complexities of the issue in the city. Local and national artists, landscape architects, filmmakers, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, and community members will be invited to collaborate on a citywide exhibition featuring installations and performances, as well as other programming.

The initiative will activate public streets, community gardens, a local elementary school, and a vacant building, which will be converted into exhibition space and a food lab with a pop-up kitchen, to address challenges stemming from the proliferation of fast food restaurants in the area. According to the Clarion-Ledger, many areas of Jackson are considered food swamps where there is almost no access to grocery stores. Due to the overabundance of fast food, the city has the second highest obesity rate in the nation and the highest rate for children between the ages of ten and seventeen.

“The city is overjoyed to have been selected in this process,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement. “This was a highly competitive grant where over two hundred cities around the world applied to be a part of this Public Art Challenge. And so, to be able to aid in the aesthetic appeal of the city while delivering a message of healthy eating for the citizens of Jackson is a truly remarkable opportunity and we are ecstatic and look forward to seeing this project come into fruition.”

Among those participating in the project are artists Adrienne Domnick and Kara Walker; filmmakers Keegan Kuhn and Roderick Red; Mark Bittman, the country’s first food-focused op-ed columnist for the New York Times and a faculty member of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health; chef Nick Wallace; clean eating advocate Ron Finley; and landscape architect Walter Hood.

In February, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited mayors of US cities with thirty thousand residents or more to submit proposals for temporary public art projects that address important civic issues. Earlier this month, Anchorage, Alaska, was the first city to be announced as a winner in the 2018 Public Art Challenge for “SEED Lab,” followed by Coral Springs in partnership with Parkland, Florida, for “Inspiring Community Healing After Gun Violence: The Power of Art.” Additional winning cities will be announced in the coming weeks.","Jackson, Mississippi, is the latest city to be awarded a $1 million Public Art Challenge Grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization of former New York City mayor Michael R.

136,"Nov 8, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Black poultry farmers say Koch Foods turned them away. Mississippi man files suit.,"CLOSE Two Koch Foods employees share what it was like at the plant when the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency raided Koch Foods. Wochit

New allegations surface in a lawsuit after investigation of Koch Foods in Mississippi. The company denies discriminating against black farmers.

Story Highlights Suit against Koch Foods filed in federal court in Jackson.

Koch Foods accused of fraud, breach of contract and civil rights violations.

“I have lost my home, my wife, my health, everything,” says Carlton Sanders of Forest.

Most chicken in U.S. produced on contracts with a handful of big companies.

Once or twice every year since 2005, a black farmer in Philadelphia, Mississippi, reached out to one of the country’s largest chicken companies about starting to work with it. The company, Koch Foods, said that the farmer was too far away and that it wasn’t taking on new growers, the farmer said in a sworn statement.

But an investigator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that Koch Foods had contracts with 10 farmers who were farther away and that it proceeded to recruit 165 other farmers since 2005, all of them white.

This new evidence surfaced in a lawsuit filed by another black farmer in Mississippi who ProPublica wrote about in June. Koch Foods used to have contracts with four black farmers in Mississippi but cut off business with them, one by one. The last to go, Carlton Sanders, lost his farm after Koch Foods wanted him to make expensive renovations that weren’t required of any white farmers.

(The company’s name is pronounced “cook,” and it is not related to conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch.)

Koch Foods has not yet responded to complaint in court

After ProPublica’s article, Sanders found a lawyer, personal injury attorney Elizabeth Citrin of Daphne, Alabama. The lawsuit, filed in October in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, accuses Koch Foods of fraud, breach of contract and violating the Civil Rights Act and the Packers and Stockyards Act, which regulates meat companies.

“Koch, and its employees, acted illegally and unconscionably in a manner that prevented [Carlton] Sanders from growing chickens in a fair and profitable manner, subjecting Sanders to agricultural servitude, akin to the abuses subjected to Sanders’s ancestors, who were slaves brought over from Africa against their will,” the lawsuit said. “All this conduct toward Plaintiff Sanders was due to his race.”

Koch Foods has not yet responded to the complaint in court. Its CEO, Joseph Grendys, declined to comment on the lawsuit or the other farmer who was refused a contract. “ONCE AGAIN I STATE KOCH FOODS, WHILE INVESTIGATED WAS NEVER CHARGED,” he said in an email.

In an earlier letter to ProPublica, Grendys denied discriminating against the black farmers in Mississippi. He said the company made multiple attempts to work with the farmers to keep their contracts. “If Koch had a bias against them for any reason,” Grendys wrote, “we would never have offered them contracts in the first place.”

But that is exactly what the farmer in Philadelphia said happened to him. The farmer’s name was redacted in the records obtained by ProPublica.

The farmer said Koch Foods told him he was “too far out” and it wasn’t accepting new growers. The USDA investigator calculated that his farm is a 58.8 mile drive from the feed mill, while Koch had contracts with 10 farmers who were farther away. A Koch employee also told the investigator in a 2013 interview that the company accepted growers as far away as 60 miles, according to the investigator’s notes.

The investigator also interviewed another black farmer who said he called Koch Foods about obtaining a contract and was repeatedly told that a representative would visit his farm, but no one ever came. He ended up having to sell his farm at a loss.

Contract system gives companies sweeping control over farmers

The affidavits from both farmers say they tried unsuccessfully to get contracts with other chicken companies in the area. Most chicken in the U.S. is grown on contracts with a handful of big companies. This system gives the companies sweeping control over farmers’ income and operations, while the farmers shoulder equipment costs and other risks.

African Americans lost the vast majority of their farmland during the 20th century and were excluded from government programs that benefited white farmers, contributing to the country’s racial wealth disparity. As of 2017, the latest available government data, just 1.3% of the country’s farmers were black, down slightly from 2012. On average, their farms were significantly smaller and poorer, according to USDA data.

Sanders visited Washington in July with a group organized by the Rural Advancement Foundation International to talk to lawmakers and USDA officials about strengthening enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act.

The Trump administration stopped tougher rules on chicken companies from taking effect and reduced staff in the office conducting investigations like the one into Koch Foods’ treatment of Sanders.

“I have lost my home, my wife, my health, everything,” Sanders said at a press conference during the visit, choking back tears. “When a company has as much control like these chicken companies do, then they can virtually act as they want without fear of reproach.”

Koch Foods supplies poultry to businesses like Burger King, Kroger, Walmart

Koch Foods is privately held and supplies chicken, often sold under other brand names, to restaurants and retailers such as Burger King, Kroger and Walmart.

One retailer, Foodtown, said it “made an independent decision” to stop carrying Koch Foods products. Other companies that Koch Foods’ website shows stocking its products didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Koch Foods’ facility in Morton, Mississippi, was among the sites raided by immigration authorities in August, part of the largest workplace sweep in decades. No company officials have been charged.
