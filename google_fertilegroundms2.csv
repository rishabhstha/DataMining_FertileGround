He’s one of the country’s best food and beverage law experts, and his firm McLaughlin PC is equally excellent. We should probably ask him for advice and insights more often. Now, this 16-year alcohol regulatory attorney vet and 2017 winner of the FX Matt Defense of the Industry Award by the Brewers Association is helping found a brewery in Mississippi.

Fertile Ground Beer Co. just announced plans for a craft brewery to be located in the historic Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Miss. Scheduled to open in 2021, Fertile Ground Beer will be housed in a former laundry building previously owned by Baptist Medical Center (kudos to reinventing old facilities). Descriptions of the locale so far include: large welcoming interior, spacious outdoor area and access to other attractions at Belhaven Town Center (a charming mixed-use development area in Jackson). As far as vision, let’s jump to the press release:

Fertile Ground Beer Co. is envisioned to be a third space. Third space is a sociocultural term to designate communal space, as distinct from the home (first space) or work (second space). The founders recognized a need for this, a place to gather, socialize and bring families, while incorporating their passion for craft beer. The transformative project will elevate craft beer in the capital city through an adaptive reuse development at Belhaven Town Center. Located in the commercial area of Belhaven, Belhaven Town Center opened with the first phase in early 2020 to include several new restaurants. The completed center will include dining, retail and small businesses. “Matthew and I were on the Belhaven Improvement Association board about a decade ago when I was just starting to think about Belhaven Town Center,” says David Turner, developer of Belhaven Town Center. “Matthew remembers me talking about this project and specifically that I wanted to get a brewery one day at this location. It’s cool how those early seeds were planted in both of our minds and we now see this coming to fruition. We are very excited about this group and their vast knowledge of the food and beverage industry and breweries in particular. We look forward to partnering with them on some cool events in the near future.” “It’s the perfect location,” says Matthew McLaughlin, co-founder of Fertile Ground Beer Co. and founder of McLaughlin, PC law firm. “We are so excited to open this brewery within the Belhaven Town Center development and know that it will be a destination that everyone can enjoy. The name Fertile Ground derives from the 2014 TEDxJackson event with the same name that focused on entrepreneurship, ideas worth spreading, creativity, and new urbanism in Jackson. Fertile Ground Beer Co. will carry these themes forward in the form of an inviting and open third space where people can enjoy locally and regionally made craft beer.” “We saw an opportunity and a need for a brewery in Jackson,” says Conner Reeves, co-founder of the brewery and attorney at McLaughlin, PC. “We aren’t quitting our day jobs, but wanted a place to drink locally-made beer. We put together a really talented team to create and operate the brewery and it’s backed by some great local investors who believe in the concept and location. The brewery will have craft beer options for everyone, from the enthusiast to the newcomer, so everyone can find their next ‘go-to’ beer.”

We’ll keep you updated on the progress.","Fertile Ground Beer Co. just announced plans for a craft brewery to be located in the historic Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Miss.

1,"Jun 10, 2020",Civil Eats,"‘Fertile Ground’ Explores How Jackson, Mississippi, Is Charting a Better Food Future","Obesity. Poverty. Food Insecurity.

Mississippi has the dubious distinction of ranking high nationally in each of these interlinked categories. With the exception of New Mexico, the Magnolia State is the most food insecure place in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents. The film, directed by Alex Warren, with executive producer Robby Piantanida, airs tonight at 7 p.m. Central Time on Mississippi PBS and is also available online at PBS.org.

“There is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement about the film. “In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people.”

Fertile Ground, which was funded in part by a grant from the Bloomberg Foundation, shows how historic redlining—a practice in which banks prevented people of color from buying mortgages in white neighborhoods—resulted in the mostly Black and impoverished neighborhood of South Jackson having few grocery stores but several convenience stores with low-quality food. The city’s car culture and lack of sidewalks and bicycle lanes add to the problem, making it a herculean task for residents without vehicles to obtain nutrient-rich food. And children in Jackson’s most economically disadvantaged areas rely on school cafeterias to get balanced meals. In Mississippi, 1 in 4 children experiences hunger, compared to 1 in 5 adults.

In the wake of these challenges, urban farms, city planning projects, farm-to-table restaurants, and efforts to provide residents with locally grown food offer hope that food equality in Jackson is possible. Fertile Ground isn’t just a film, but an initiative that aims to shape policy and public dialogue about food access and nutrition through art, workshops, panel discussions, and other events.

Civil Eats spoke with Jackson chef Enrika Williams, a Fertile Ground workshop facilitator, and Travis Crabtree, a Jackson-based urban designer and Fertile Ground project manager, about the new documentary, redlining, urban farming, and the food inequities their city faces.

How does the layout of Jackson contribute to food inequality?

Travis Crabtree. Travis Crabtree.

Travis Crabtree: Whenever you have a city that is extremely car oriented, obviously you have accessibility issues, especially when you have neighborhoods that don’t have good public transportation, low car ownership, and no sidewalks—which is the reality for a lot of Jackson. Jackson started being built from the core, which is downtown Jackson, and then over time, you had white flight and people started to leave the city. That’s when all the grocery stores left.

It’s a very typical pattern in American cities. It has happened all over the country, but Jackson is a place that’s already dealing with extreme poverty, racial tensions, and [less] access to resources. When it comes to food insecurity, it’s super exacerbated here.

The documentary discusses how poverty in some Jackson neighborhoods played a role in supermarkets leaving. Why do you think that is?

Enrika Williams. Enrika Williams.

Enrika Williams: You can find plenty of convenience stores that have decided to take EBT because people in the community who are using food assistance need a place to spend their money so they can eat. But the larger grocery store chains are in the business of making money, and capitalists are not empathetic to anything but . . . making money. So, if the majority of the people who come into your stores are on some sort of public assistance, you look at the bottom line and think, “I’m not making any money.”

I also think there’s a stigma attached to public assistance recipients. Stores don’t want to appear to be accommodating to a demographic of EBT recipients. There’s also an insurance standpoint: It costs more to put your grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. It’s like another form of redlining.

How does the history of redlining play a role in the city’s present-day food landscape?

Crabtree: It’s really clear what lines divide Jackson—the train yard, the interstate, and these other sorts of urban barriers, even institutions like colleges or hospitals. They act as really large barriers that are disconnecting the white neighborhoods from Black neighborhoods. And generally the white neighborhoods are the ones that have the grocery stores and are more affluent.

Redlining obviously exists in most American cities, but it’s so apparent here. One thing that we’ve done outside of the documentary is we have a major public art component. We’ve tried to position our public art installations at the intersections of the redlines to bring the two communities together. We’re putting them right up against the railroad tracks and the different sort of segregation points to try to have conversations about what an integrated Jackson would be like.","The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents.

2,"Jun 10, 2020",Northside Sun,“Fertile Ground” Documentary Airing on Mississippi Public Broadcasting and Public Broadcasting,"June 01, 2020 – The City of Jackson announced today that Fertile Ground , a documentary examining the extensive impact the industrial food system has on Jacksonians, will air on June 10th at 7pm CST on the Mississippi Public Broadcasting television station and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) will make the documentary available online here. On June 21st at 5pm CST Mississippi Public Broadcasting will re-air the documentary on their television station.

The Fertile Ground documentary follows the life of local residents experiencing challenges accessing healthy food options, while also detailing the systematic policy failures that have allowed “food swamps” to thrive. Featuring interviews with local farmers, food activists and city leaders, the documentary also spotlights the growing possibility to transform Jackson’s local food system. This documentary is part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Art Challenge. View the trailer here.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said, “This project is so important because we live in abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity and in our society there is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options. In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. And, in spaces where people have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. And so, as a city we should return the love and show our citizens that we want them to have an abundance of healthy food alternatives. The Fertile Ground documentary does an excellent job of portraying just how prevalent the problem of food access is here in our city and I am proud to have members of this administration actively working to remedy this issue for our citizens.”

The documentary team is comprised of homegrown, a host of Mississippi talent including, Executive Producer - Robby Piantanida, Director Alex Warren, Director of Photography, Aaron Phillips, Producer - Jocephus “Skipp” Martin, Sound Mixer, Taiwo Gaynor, Set Photographer - Drew Dempsey. Salam Rida, City of Jackson Urban Designer said, “The documentary is an art project that inspires a larger conversation about the issues with our global food system. The COVID-19 crisis has brought a newfound awareness to Jacksonians about where their food comes from and how global supply chain volatility can disrupt our everyday lives. At the City of Jackson we hope communities can use this moment to move forward on how we would like to address food access and decentralize some aspects of our food system.”

The documentary is part of a larger initiative called “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access”, which uses public art as a medium to inspire dialogue about food access in Jackson, Mississippi. The City of Jackson was awarded the grant from the Bloomberg

Philanthropies Public Art Challenge in November 2018. Mike Bloomberg said, “The Public Art Challenge is designed to strengthen communities like Jackson with moving works of art that highlight complex problems - and foster public discussion about solutions. Fertile Ground does just that, telling the story of a city that has too few healthy food options. It’s also the story of people – like Mayor Lumumba, artists, farmers, urban planners, and other local leaders – who are creating new opportunities to deliver better

options. As the Coronavirus proves especially dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, and as African-American communities suffer the highest death rates, Fertile Ground has taken on new power and urgency.”

In addition to this documentary, the project is made up of physical installations deployed within food deserts across the city, community engagement sessions, a podcast series, performance art, a food policy roadmap, and a project opening expo that has been postponed due to COVID-19. The project brings together an interdisciplinary network of artists, designers, architects, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, policymakers, and community members to discuss the complexities of the City’s food system.

4,"May 6, 2019",The Architect's Newspaper,"In Jackson, Mississippi, architects are taking on a citywide hunger problem","By more than one measure, Jackson, Mississippi, is one of the nation’s unhealthiest cities. In 2017, it was named the fattest city in America based on 17 indicators, including obesity rates, levels of physically active adults, and access to fresh produce. In fact, nearly one-fifth of city residents are considered food insecure. The state of Mississippi does not fare much better—for the last eight years, it was reported as the most food insecure state in the country, even though agriculture is the state’s top industry.

It’s not just that Jackson has only 17 grocery stores for a population of nearly 170,000—that’s one per nearly 10,000 people. But the food that is available is disproportionately tipped toward fast food and gas station items. As one scholar of Jackson’s food culture told the Clarion Ledger, “Hunger happens in between bags of chips.”

All of this is compounded by the city’s lack of viable public transit options. Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one. Even those with groceries or farmers’ markets in walking distance are discouraged by the lack of sidewalks or crosswalks. These conditions are undergirded by decades of generational poverty and disinvestment due to white flight, unfavorable tax policies, and the state’s aggressive efforts to cut resources for Medicaid and limit food stamps.

But Jackson also has a long history of civil rights activism, and its residents in 2013 and again in 2017 elected mayors who promised nothing less than wholesale social and economic transformation. For Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, addressing Jackson’s food access challenge is part of his promise to make it “the most radical city in the world.” But rather than enlisting conventional strategies, the city has mobilized its long-range planning division to lead a new design-based initiative. Bolstered by a $1 million public art grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access” brings together architects and artists alongside chefs, gardeners, food policy experts, and local institutions to facilitate a year of community-engaged interventions at three sites in the city. The project will culminate in a citywide exhibition in the spring of 2020, but ultimately it aims to establish a nonprofit research lab on food access that will operate on a permanent basis to sustain the momentum that is created.

The city invited an intriguing roster of architects and designers from around the country to participate in the multidisciplinary initiative: Kathy Velikov and Geoffrey Thün, directors of RVTR; Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Akoaki; Walter Hood of Hood Design Studio, and Jonathan Tate, who runs his namesake practice, Office of Jonathan Tate. Architects are central to the project, said Travis Crabtree, a senior urban planner with the city and one of the project’s coordinators. “When we first got the grant, people asked, Why are we spending $1 million dollars on an art project when we could feed people for a million?” he said.

Looking more closely at what these designers bring to the table may illustrate what can be gained from this approach. The question of access is at the heart of practices like the Toronto and Ann Arbor, Michigan–based RVTR, led by Velikov and Thün, who are both associate professors at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. In their ongoing project, Protean Prototypes, they conceive of public transit systems as platforms to address access to mobility, food, education, and health. They do this by mapping the social and spatial opportunities for access, connecting underserved areas with local actors who can bridge access gaps and by proposing lightweight spatial prototypes that overlay onto public transit infrastructure, such as bus stops and metro stations. The prototypes might include emerging tech like mobile produce vending systems and bike-cart shares alongside other programs with a small footprint like exercise equipment and book lending programs. Applying this method to Chicago, San Francisco, and Detroit, this complex systems approach brings together architectural and urban scale in new assemblages that amplify the resources already on the ground and take advantage of the larger urban context to channel them where they are needed most.

In Jackson, Velikov and Thün will focus their efforts at the Ecoshed, a 15,000-square-foot, open-air building on a 2-acre industrial site that borders two very different neighborhoods—the rapidly gentrifying Fondren and Virden Addition, one of the poorest in the city. For Fertile Ground, the Ecoshed will demonstrate a self-sustaining closed-loop food system and host the food lab, and eventually host the Fertile Ground nonprofit.

Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Detroit-based Akoaki will also focus their efforts at the Ecoshed. Their practice has engaged with the problem of food access through four years of work with an urban farm in Detroit, the Oakland Avenue Urban Farm. Sirota is also an associate professor of architecture at Taubman. Detroit provides a uniquely fertile landscape for thinking about urban food access. According to Sirota, Detroit has 1,300 urban farms, but none of them are sustainable. At the 6-acre Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, sustainability for Sirota and Farges has meant strategizing beyond economics alone. To them, urban farms are hubs for urban regeneration, and they realized that multiple layers of activity and programming were needed to realize that potential. Like Velikov and Thün, they see architecture as a way of “amplifying the activity that’s already happening on the ground, to stitch together new and productive alliances.”

Detroit may be 1,000 miles from Jackson, but the connection between the two cities runs deep. Like Jackson, Detroit is a majority African American city, with many residents who have ties to Mississippi and other southern states. Thus, the Oakland Avenue farm grows many heritage products from Mississippi. Likewise, the association to agriculture is similarly fraught in both cities; as Sirota noted, “We are highly attuned to the idea that going back to the land isn’t necessarily representationally positive to everyone.” Rather than framing urban farming as a return to an idyllic past (and glossing over the history of slavery and policies that led to the dispossession or denial of land to freed slaves), Akoaki’s urban farm work is firmly sited in the urban. “We’ve become astutely aware that the neo-rural is not rural; it’s something that deserves an aesthetic that hybridizes all the aspirations of the city and combines them with the necessity to produce picturesque landscape and food.” Thus the practice’s design of pop-up performance spaces next to the farm’s kale fields for the Detroit African Funkestra is based on the colors and shapes of shuttered music venues across Detroit.

Another participating architect, Oakland-based landscape architect Walter Hood, has extensive experience designing cultural and urban landscapes. Hood, who is also a professor at University of California, Berkeley’s will focus his efforts at Galloway Elementary in Jackson. The 4.3-acre, publicly owned lot is currently a playfield for a local elementary school. According to the city’s planning department, this site is located in a lower-income residential neighborhood with little public space and bordered by a major street dominated by fast food establishments. The theme here will be on food and community.

This is a good fit for Hood. His projects in Charleston, South Carolina; Macon, Georgia; Detroit, and Philadelphia, among other cities, demonstrate a steady thread of incorporating community feedback, local culture, and collective memory into landscape and urban design. In his Water Table installation at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, Hood tapped into the ecology and history of rice production by mounting thousands of Carolina Gold rice plants in circular planters on a platform in a school courtyard, essentially recreating a rice paddy in downtown Charleston. The project resurfaced the link between rice production and the history of the slave labor that made Carolina’s rice industry possible. Afterwards, the project was dissembled and distributed, planter by planter, across schools and institutions in the area, and lived on to continue the conversation. This archaeological approach also surfaces in many other projects by Hood Studio, including its master plan for Detroit’s Rosa Parks neighborhood. Hood’s work has long engaged with the idea of “being a protagonist in design,” and, in reflecting on the future work in Jackson, asked, “How do we make a landscape powerful, so that once you do it, it has a resonance?”

Finally, at Congress Street, the third Fertile Ground site, New Orleans–based architect Jonathan Tate will bring his experience with food culture and exhibition design to a downtown storefront space. The Congress Street site is close to the heart of government and is intended to amplify the project to public officials and policymakers who work nearby.

For Tate, who designed the Southern Food and Beverage Museum in New Orleans, the task includes not only the adaptive reuse of an existing building but also the design of an outdoor parklet that invites the public in through greenscape and seating. The challenge will be to bring it all together—the art, the history, the contributions of numerous partners, and of course, engage critical feedback, in a downtown that goes quiet at 5 p.m. on weekdays. “Instead of a veneer you’re walking through, it’s about bringing the space of the building out into the street,” he explained.

The architects, along with other Fertile Ground team members, began site visits in April, and will develop their proposals until the citywide expo in 2020.","Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one.

International Museum of Muslim Cultures Receives Kellogg Foundation Grant

The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently gave a three-year, $475,000 grant to the International Museum of Muslim Cultures in Jackson. IMMC has received grant awards totaling $1,140,000 from Kellogg Foundation since 2017, including $65,000 in June for COVID-19 relief.

IMMC is currently exhibiting “Muslims with Christians and Jews: An Exhibition of Covenants and Coexistence,” which opened in June 2020 at IMMC’s satellite location at 101 E. Capitol St. in downtown Jackson. The Exhibit introduces the “peace-building leadership of Muhammad, the Prophet and Head of State, who prepared the first Constitution in history for his multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious Commonwealth,” a release from IMMC says.

The museum is also displaying the “Legacy of Timbuktu: Wonders of the Written Word” exhibition at its 201 E. Pascagoula St. location, which emphasizes Islamic West Africa’s culture of literature, scholarship, wealth and empire-building, the release says.

IMMC has used earlier grants from the Kellogg Foundation as part of its efforts to educate communities nationwide in understanding that “human dignity is fundamental to combating injustice and achieving racial equity and healing.”

The Muslim Public Affairs Council will host IMMC in a virtual webinar on Thursday, Dec. 17, at 6 p.m. central time, which will feature “Exploring African Islamic Contributions to Civilization.""

8,"Feb 26, 2020",Jackson Free Press,Jackson's Food Insecurity Focus in April Expo,"In a state where one in four children go to bed hungry at night, solutions to the food insecurity that plagues Jackson and other southern cities are the goal of a series of public art installations and workshops. The Fertile Ground Expo, scheduled for April 9-11, aims to address the history and future of food access in Mississippi and beyond.

""We know when you are hungry, you can't perform at your best,"" Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at a press conference Tuesday in downtown Jackson. ""Hunger is a problem that reaches beyond one's belly but affects every aspect of a person's way of life, which ultimately impacts how we function as a society.""

Agriculture may be the state's leading industry, but Mississippi remains one of the hungriest in the country, Salam Rida pointed out at the presser. She is a program manager for the expo and an urban designer for the City of Jackson.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" In a recent report, the department revealed that more than 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2018.

Mississippi has consistently ranked as one of the most food-insecure states in the nation. Between 2010 and 2018, the state ranked No. 1 in food insecurity. It also has the highest poverty rate.

One in four Mississsippians—more than 600,000 people—experience food insecurity. The issue is especially profound for the state's elderly population and children. Half the state's senior population does not have enough to eat, and about 25% of Mississippi's children go to sleep hungry.

The Mississippi Food Network reports that in Hinds County alone, nearly 62,000 people have too little to eat—more than the entire food-insecure population of North Dakota.

Food insecurity has multiple adverse health impacts, ranging from developmental problems for young people to difficulties concentrating in school. Given that nutritious foods tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods, families struggling with food access are more likely to eat foods that are detrimental to their overall physical health. Experts also link food insecurity to additional problems such as housing access and inadequate access to medical care.

The USDA notes that a number of state-level factors affect the degree to which a state experiences food insecurity. These include wages, housing costs and unemployment as well as ""State-level policies that affect access to unemployment insurance, the State Earned Income Tax Credit, and nutrition assistance programs.""

""The goal of the expo weekend is not only to be critical of our existing food system, but to provide new ideas and solutions for developing a more food-secure environment for southern cities,"" Rida said.

Scheduled to take place in various Jackson neighborhoods experiencing food-access issues, the Fertile Ground Expo will bring together prominent area and national chefs, nutritionists, farmers, activists, artists, and policy makers for workshops, dialogues and exhibits related to food. More than 30 events will tackle topics including the history of food insecurity, how to ferment food, urban farming, food waste, the food traditions of Farish Street, the impact of food insecurity on families and more.

The event is free.

Participants include acclaimed artist Kara Walker, chef and food writer Mark Bittman, local chef Nick Wallace and interdisciplinary Mississippi artist Adrienne Domnick.

The mayor thanked Bloomberg Philanthropy for its $1-million gift to organize the expo. In 2018, Jackson became one of five cities that the philanthropic organization selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants as part of its Public Art Challenge competition. At the Feb. 25 press conference, Lumumba added that Bloomberg Philanthropy work was independent of Mike Bloomberg's campaign for the presidency, while emphasizing the need to focus on the problem of hunger.

""We live in a world of abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity. In our society, there is no room or justification for anyone to go hungry, for anyone not to have access to healthy food options,"" the mayor said at the press conference, adding that food is how Mississippians show love in their communities.

""Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. In spaces where people often have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you and provide you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. As a city, we should return the love,"" he said.

9,"Dec 6, 2020",Brewbound.com,Fertile Ground Beer Co. to Open Craft Brewery in Belhaven,"JACKSON, Miss. – Fertile Ground Beer Co. is pleased to announce plans for a craft brewery to be located in the historic Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Mississippi. Scheduled to open in 2021, Fertile Ground Beer Co. will be located in a former laundry building previously owned by Baptist Medical Center. The taproom-focused brewery will feature an inviting space where Jackson Metro residents as well as people passing through Jackson can enjoy locally-made beer. It will provide patrons with a large welcoming interior, spacious outdoor area, and access to other attractions at Belhaven Town Center.

Fertile Ground Beer Co. is envisioned to be a third space. Third space is a sociocultural term to designate communal space, as distinct from the home (first space) or work (second space). The founders recognized a need for this, a place to gather, socialize and bring families, while incorporating their passion for craft beer. The transformative project will elevate craft beer in the capital city through an adaptive reuse development at Belhaven Town Center. Located in the commercial area of Belhaven, Belhaven Town Center opened with the first phase in early 2020 to include several new restaurants. The completed center will include dining, retail and small businesses.

“Matthew and I were on the Belhaven Improvement Association board about a decade ago when I was just starting to think about Belhaven Town Center,” says David Turner, developer of Belhaven Town Center. “Matthew remembers me talking about this project and specifically that I wanted to get a brewery one day at this location. It’s cool how those early seeds were planted in both of our minds and we now see this coming to fruition. We are very excited about this group and their vast knowledge of the food and beverage industry and breweries in particular. We look forward to partnering with them on some cool events in the near future.”

The historic Belhaven neighborhood is home to numerous businesses, restaurants, artists, and one of the most popular August events in the Southeast. The Bright Lights Belhaven Nights annual music festival attracts several thousand people to the neighborhood. Attendees travel from neighboring states to enjoy three stages filled with live music, local artisans, and restaurants. In addition to the commercial and artistic attributes, Belhaven was designated as one of American Planning Association’s “Great Neighborhoods in America 2014.”

“It’s the perfect location,” says Matthew McLaughlin, co-founder of Fertile Ground Beer Co. and founder of McLaughlin, PC law firm. “We are so excited to open this brewery within the Belhaven Town Center development and know that it will be a destination that everyone can enjoy. The name Fertile Ground derives from the 2014 TEDxJackson event with the same name that focused on entrepreneurship, ideas worth spreading, creativity, and new urbanism in Jackson. Fertile Ground Beer Co. will carry these themes forward in the form of an inviting and open third space where people can enjoy locally and regionally made craft beer.”

“We saw an opportunity and a need for a brewery in Jackson,” says Conner Reeves, co-founder of the brewery and attorney at McLaughlin, PC. “We aren’t quitting our day jobs, but wanted a place to drink locally-made beer. We put together a really talented team to create and operate the brewery and it’s backed by some great local investors who believe in the concept and location. The brewery will have craft beer options for everyone, from the enthusiast to the newcomer, so everyone can find their next ‘go-to’ beer.”

Across the nation, craft breweries are having an immeasurable economic impact on their communities. Case studies have shown increases in residential and commercial property values located near craft breweries. Many craft breweries are opened in old or abandoned buildings breathing life back into the area and creating interest in the forgotten space. Craft breweries are also viewed as a quality of life amenity to many neighborhoods.

“I am thrilled that Greater Belhaven will be home to Fertile Ground Beer Co.,” said Casey Creasey, executive director of Greater Belhaven Foundation. “The brewery will not only create a community space for Belhaven residents, but will also attract our city neighbors while showcasing our historic neighborhood. Fertile Ground Beer Co. represents a national trend where breweries and brewpubs creatively repurpose existing commercial buildings and further transform neighborhoods. The brewery will be a welcomed addition to those restaurants and hospitality businesses that currently call Belhaven home.”

10,"Mar 23, 2020",Undark Magazine,"In the American South, Covid-19 Could Find Fertile Ground","In early 2018, Bill Crawford learned that Mississippi lawmakers intended to shrink Medicaid reimbursements by 5 percent. Crawford, a longtime community leader from Meridian, worried about the wisdom of cutting funds for medical care in the throes of an influenza epidemic.

He sat down and typed out a column for the Mississippi Business Journal, describing a situation across the state that looked grim. “Mothers with sick babies on Medicaid have trouble getting timely access to providers. Clinics are backed up, hospital emergency rooms are on patient diversion, and too many children are really sick,” wrote Crawford, a Republican who once represented the state’s 83rd district in the legislature. Given the burdens of the flu, he warned, further cuts to Medicaid could cripple small town hospitals, half of which are already reported to be at the brink of failure. Next door, in Alabama, 88 percent of rural hospitals operate in the red.

“Before any of this coronavirus came along, we were facing significant challenges in the health care area.”

“Before any of this coronavirus came along, we were facing significant challenges in the health care area,” said Crawford, who is 72 and now lives in Jackson. Today, with the relentless advance of the disease known as Covid-19, Crawford worries about his state’s vulnerability — especially given that the population is generally older, poorer, less insured, and stricken with higher rates of chronic disease than urban hubs. Mississippi, which has the lowest life expectancy in the country, is one of 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

“The attitude down here is that we don’t want government involvement in our lives,” Crawford said. “We wanted it when Katrina hit — when there’s a catastrophe. But otherwise in the general South right now, we don’t want it. We want to get rid of regulation. We don’t want to spend any money. We want to cut taxes. And that’s fine. But if you don’t tend to your essential infrastructure, you really put yourself at risk.”

While no corner of the country is likely to be untouched by Covid-19, some experts worry that the virus might leave a deadlier wake once it gathers strength in southern states. Early numbers are still low in the Deep South: Mississippi has about 250 cases and one death. Alabama has around 200 cases and no documented fatalities. Louisiana numbers are higher, at more than 1,000 infections and more than 30 deaths — though most so far are in and around New Orleans. But the mortality of coronavirus infection rises when patients have underlying health concerns.

One study in Wuhan, China, found that more than half the deaths occurred among those who had conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Another study in Italy reported that upwards of 99 percent of deaths were among people with prior medical conditions. In the U.S., data already suggest that rural counties, especially those in the South, bear the highest death rates from lower respiratory infections.

“The number of people who are going to be at risk is dramatically higher in the South,” said Jay Maddock, former dean of the School of Public Health at Texas A&M University who studies chronic disease patterns. Take high blood pressure. In Arkansas “41.9 percent of their adult population has hypertension, versus 24.5 percent in Utah. It’s almost double what some of the lowest states are,” he said. And while West Virginia has the country’s number one rate of diabetes, Maddock said, “Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana are two, three, four and five.”

In many ways, the United States was fortunate that Seattle was the beachhead for the epidemic, said Jeffrey Levi of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. “The Seattle-King County public health department and the Washington State public health department are two of the best in the country. And so as bad as it looks, it probably would have been much worse with a weaker health department that didn’t have a host of advantages, including a large cadre of very well-trained public health workers.” In comparison to many other cities, the Seattle area is also generally younger, healthier and well insured, Levi said.

More than 2,000 miles away, a far different health ecosystem awaits. In Mississippi, about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty — twice the rate of Washington state. In 2019, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama were ranked as the country’s least healthy states. “The less healthy the population, the more likely the epidemic is to have fatal consequences for individuals,” Levi said. “And the weaker the health system, the harder it will be to contain.”

Paul Erwin, dean the School of Public Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that the public health infrastructure in his state is solid, if underfunded, and small towns are generally coping with the same challenges as big cities. “Like all other health departments, they been severely hamstrung by the limited testing availability,” he said. For him, the bigger concern is the same thing that weighs on Bill Crawford — the physical capacity for care.

A wave of 120 hospital closures in rural America over the past decade has left many parts of the South with no nearby hospital, and many of those that remain have drastically offloaded services and staff to stay afloat. These rural hospitals have, on average, only about 50 beds, but in more isolated areas the number can be as small as 25 or fewer. And while beds devoted specifically to intensive-care — which many coronavirus patients will need — have been growing at large hospitals, they have been shrinking for small and medium facilities. More than 80 percent of the hospitals that have closed since 2014 were also located in states that did not expand Medicaid. “Not only are the rural hospitals closing,” Maddock said, “but the ones that we have are lucky if they have one ventilator. There’s a worldwide shortage of ventilators right now, but you’re not going to find them in the rural hospitals. And if you can get them, they’re very expensive.”

Many smaller hospitals cope with emergencies by stabilizing patients and sending them to larger cities with more specialized care — but once the virus reaches the countryside, urban centers are also likely to be full.

Levi, of George Washington University, also worries that many infected people in southern states may be gravely ill before they even seek care because more of the population lacks health insurance. Among the states that have not expanded Medicaid, more than half are southern. (In a line starting east of New Mexico, only Arkansas and Louisiana have taken the expansion.) After the testing shortage is overcome, people without health insurance are still likely to hesitate seeking timely care — even if they have the hallmark symptoms of infection — for fear of creating medical bills they can’t pay. So far, none of the emergency legislation addresses the cost of treatment for coronavirus; one Massachusetts woman’s bill came to $34,927.43.

“When it’s an infectious disease outbreak, you don’t want people to delay seeking a diagnosis and getting into treatment of some kind,” Levi said. But someone without health insurance may think, “Oh, if I go to the emergency room and I get a $2,000 bill, and what if I don’t even have it? I’m still going to get a bill,” he said. “That’s just going to make you hesitate until you are very sick.”

Paul Erwin agrees. “The lack of insurance plays a huge role in terms of access to care,” he said. “People who don’t have insurance are reluctant to seek care until things get to be dire for them. By that time, it can be difficult to provide them with treatment that will make a difference.”

In addition to lacking good health insurance, many people living in southern and rural states face a barrier of distance, said Catherine Flowers, a community health advocate who lives in Montgomery. (Flowers was the driving force behind a study that found a high prevalence of hookworm among rural communities Alabama.) “People in cities are having a hard time getting tested, but can you imagine if you have to drive 30, 40, 50 miles to get to the place — only to be told you can’t get a test? Then what’s going to happen?”

Finally, there’s the question of how the cultural and societal fabric might influence the pandemic. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram has reported that rural counties are generally more skeptical that the disease should concern them. “Other than city folk coming down trying to buy all our toilet paper, we haven’t been affected,” one volunteer fire chief told the newspaper. On his blog Trouble in God’s Country, Charlie Hayslett, a former newspaperman from Atlanta, wrote, “as I’ve documented before, rural Georgia is overwhelmingly Republican and pro-Trump, and there’s already national polling by Pew Research suggesting that Republicans are taking Covid-19 less seriously than Democrats.”

In a March 19 post, Hayslett lamented how people in the country seemed slower to restrict large gatherings, especially Sunday worship. “I started canvassing rural Georgia contacts earlier this week and one common theme in the feedback revolved around a reluctance to cancel church services; as things have worked out, it sounds like the cancellations are indeed taking place, maybe a week later than they might have,” he said. This is not simply a small town phenomenon. One Baton Rouge megachurch, in defiance of the Louisiana governor’s order to limit gatherings, held a Sunday service of more than 1,000 people on March 15, and another service two days later. So did First Baptist Church in Dallas, which has a flock of 14,000.

“Worship is essential,” pastor Robert Jeffress told a local television station.

That said, the response varied from city to city: Church of the Highlands, the largest congregation in Alabama with more than 50,000 members, announced on March 14 that all services in its 22 locations would be online. The church is also hosting a testing site, and partnering with food banks and schools support people in need. A message on the church web site reads, “Many of you have expressed a desire to help, reminding us yet again why we love being part of the local church with you.”

It is the social cohesiveness of Southerners — the gravitational pull to tradition and family — that stand to provide resilience in a time of overwhelming need. “Not to say we’re any different from anywhere else, but we do care about each other,” said Erwin, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “And I see that as something strong in our favor. There is this expression of concern for your neighbor and their wellbeing. And there’s the acknowledgement that your neighbor’s wellbeing impacts your wellbeing.”

Those same bonds also might deepen the psychological toll of an epidemic that could leave no town unspared. “I am someone that’s from a small community and I know that when you have one death in a small community, it’s devastating,” Flowers said. Several could be emotionally catastrophic.

For now, she’s actively pushing national leaders to consider reopening closed hospitals to care for patients, perhaps staffed by the military — a plan she said could help in areas that are already underserved. “Some of them are literally sitting empty, and some of them are barely open,” Flowers said. Communities elsewhere are also having similar discussions. The vacant buildings “can be repurposed, I think, pretty fast to be able to provide treatment for people that are living maybe in those regions.”

But that will require a rapid mobilization the coming weeks or months. “We are eking our way into the space, kind of like the nation, which means we missed an opportunity to slow this down in Mississippi,” Bill Crawford said. Still, he predicts that he and his neighbors will draw on one another, and their faith, to get them through.

“We’re a state in a Bible belt,” he said. “There’s a lot of prayer going on.”

15,"Mar 10, 2020",The Intercept,"Dispatch From Mississippi: Biden, Sanders, and the Battle to Win Black Voters in the South","On a bright and blustery Saturday afternoon, three days before the Mississippi primary, the 36-year-old mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, approached a group of men drinking beers around a pickup truck outside the Head Turners Barbershop. Bearing the seal of his office on a black windbreaker, Lumumba solemnly informed the men they were in violation of city ordinances, triggering peals of laughter all around. Then Lumumba got down to business. He was there to generate interest in Bernie Sanders, and skepticism about Joe Biden, the presumed favored candidate of Mississippi Democrats. Lumumba had arrived at the barbershop from a nearby Baptist Church, where he’d launched a Sanders volunteer canvass of the historic black community of Presidential Hill. While volunteers knocked on screen doors and left flyers on porches, he and another surrogate, the Miami-based organizer and educator Philip Agnew, hit the barbershops of north Jackson. Lumumba and Agnew tag-teamed what can be a heavy lift in Mississippi: introducing Sanders and his platform, defending his electability, and reducing his opponent Biden to a man, as Agnew likes to say, with black friends but no black policies. “Can you name one Biden policy?” Agnew asked Head Turners’ 60-something barber, Ron Davis. “Being Obama’s vice is not sufficient,” he continued. “He was chosen to balance the ticket.” Lumumba and Agnew together sketched Biden’s authorship of the 1994 crime bill and large back catalog of racist and borderline racist comments. One time, Lumumba recounted, Biden told him and other black mayors at a conference in Atlanta that black parents can’t help with homework because they “can’t read or write.” “I just want to make sure you know who we’re propping up,” Lumumba said as the meeting winds down. “We have a choice on Tuesday.” The taciturn barber didn’t need much convincing that Sanders’s moral economy sounded like a good thing. “The rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer,” he said. “People working all their lives, they should be retiring, but still have to work. That’s not right.” But his questions, and the questions from others in the shop, belied a wariness that can’t be overcome in 20 minutes a few days before an election: Why isn’t Sanders a Democrat? How can he offer free health care and tuition when the Republicans are cutting existing benefits? Isn’t this a capitalist country?

While the poorest, blackest, and most incarcerated states of the country would seem to be fertile ground for Sanders, at least in the primary, they’ve proven instead to be the most arid. The Alabama primary was a repeat of the South Carolina vote that refueled Biden’s campaign and sent Sanders’s into a cross-country skid, and Mississippi will likely continue the pattern. In 2016, there was no Mayor Lumumba in the barbershops arguing that Sanders deserves black votes and can beat the Republican, while the famous Democrat doesn’t and can’t. How that conversation develops will determine not just the viability of a Sanders nomination in 2020, but the long-term prospects of the multiracial, multigenerational social movement that was supposed to midwife it.

From the start, Bernie Sanders has said his candidacy can only succeed if powered by an unprecedented coalition of black, brown, and working-class voters — a magnetized juggernaut that could attract disaffected Americans in a virtuous cycle of self-perpetuating people power. While the campaign did bring in large numbers of Latinos, new Americans, and millennial black voters, South Carolina showed the limits of any coalition that is missing the older black voters who form a base constituency in much of the country. Biden sealed his victory there with 60 percent of the black vote, with no surge in new voters, a number that he increased to 75 percent a few days later in Alabama on Super Tuesday. Not much money is spent polling the Mississippi primary, but it’s possible that Biden will end up with 80-plus percent of the vote, with black voters making up 70 percent of the electorate. If so, it will be the second time in four years that Mississippi has handed Sanders his worst loss with a message taped inside of it. What does that message say? Biden’s resurgence produced a market for neat explanations of black political behavior. The narrative seems to have settled somewhere over the broad thesis that black voters, especially in the South, are generally risk averse and have good reason for being so. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn’s endorsement of Biden formalized the sense that, despite everything, Biden — with the familiar “D” next to his name — is the safest bet for a return to normalcy and a never-perfect status quo. Some white progressives find this rationale dismaying, given that Sanders performs well in head-to-head matchups against Donald Trump, and is running on a platform much more tailored to the needs of black communities across a range of issues, from health care to criminal justice reform. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio evinced this dismay when he suggested “the Clyburn effect” was a form of low-information false consciousness, echoing familiar Republican canards about black voters’ generational allegiance to the Democratic Party. Somewhere, right now, terms are probably being negotiated on a controversial future bestseller called, “What’s the Matter With South Carolina?”

The pushback was just as swift. Black voters, a chorus of voices proclaimed, have as fine an appreciation for the limits, dangers, tragedies, and ironies of U.S. politics as anyone can. The Nation’s Elie Mystal saw the South Carolina vote expressing the cynical judgment that Sanders was too good for us and that his presence in the general would hand Trump reelection — because “most white people are selfish and cannot be trusted to do the right thing.” In this view, the political risk antenna of older black voters is reliable and hard-earned. If it warns to take even money rather than bet everything on promises that won’t be fulfilled, maybe there’s a reason. But if the default conservatism of this position is understandable, it’s also dangerous and debatable, say Sanders supporters, not least for its failure to account for the urgency of the climate crisis. The Sanders campaign is based on a belief that a left supermajority can be formed, and that means finding ways to overcome resistance and win people over. “Our organizing has fallen short in some ways with black folks across the South,” Agnew said. “We’re purging the feeling that these people don’t know what’s real, because they do know what’s real. They live real lives. They’ve been told some lies, so we need to be able to engage with it, to speak to people’s anxieties and say, ‘We’re not the risky bet here.’ We have the people, the volunteers, the energy. The path is uncomfortable and new, but it doesn’t have to be scary. Our job is to engage with that on a real level, not talk down to them or call them low-information.” Organizers for Sanders say such engagement pays off in Mississippi the same as it would anywhere else, though the starting line may be a little farther back. The biggest obstacle to getting lifetime Democrats to question the party and imagine a new kind of politics is a lack of time and people, not just their “risk averse” natures. “Many people we talk to are hearing about Sanders for the first time from us, or the only thing they know is that someone told them he is a communist,” said James Hempill, a Sanders organizer and Jackson native. “It’s a question of having time to explain his program, address electability fears, and explain democratic socialism. But it’s doable. I just met an older black lady who was leaving her house to go cook for the homeless. She cares about people, votes in every election — the kind of person you’d expect to know about Sanders and the primary. But she didn’t. Not because she’s dumb; she just didn’t know.” Hempill racked up so many of these stories that when he started canvassing for six months ago, he decided, “if we had two years to raise awareness, knocking on doors and having conversations, Bernie wins Mississippi in a landslide.”

While the campaign did bring in large numbers of Latinos, new Americans, and millennial black voters, South Carolina showed the limits of any coalition that is missing the older black voters who form a base constituency in much of the country.
The narrative seems to have settled somewhere over the broad thesis that black voters, especially in the South, are generally risk averse and have good reason for being so.
Black voters, a chorus of voices proclaimed, have as fine an appreciation for the limits, dangers, tragedies, and ironies of U.S. politics as anyone can.

16,"Feb 25, 2019",GreenBiz,Soil becomes fertile ground for climate action,"Soil quality is a growing focus in the sustainability space, and for good reason: Fertile soil naturally stabilizes the climate and ensures resilient supply chains. But a third of the planet’s land is severely degraded, and fertile soil is being lost at the rate of 24 billion tons a year, according to a 2017 United Nations-backed study. So, a small but growing group of companies — some directly in agriculture or ranching, others indirectly via sourcing — are investing in healthy soil initiatives.

Soil, no matter how healthy, may not be the spiciest climate solution. It’s not a giant machine that can suck carbon directly from the air — or is it?

In fact, Earth’s soils contain more than three times more carbon than is stored in the atmosphere, and four times more than the amount in all living plants and animals. Biologically speaking, the microbes and minerals in soil systems serve critical, beneficial roles in land stewardship: They regulate water, cycle nutrients, filter pollutants, physically support plants and sequester greenhouse gases (GHGs).

Soil is, indeed, a buried treasure.

Essentially, what’s good for soil is good for the climate — and for business. Until recently, most of the action was cultivated by smaller, niche players in the organic and natural products space. Soapmaker Dr. Bronner’s special operations team, for instance, has long worked with suppliers and farmers to support soil fertility as part of its Fair Trade certification.

Soil isn't a giant machine that can suck carbon directly from the air — or is it? Bigger companies, too, must clean up their value chains, and one of the most effective ways is starting, literally, from the ground up — the origin of many soil-dependent commodities, from food to fiber to fuels.

That’s no easy task. Agricultural value chains are vast and complex, and some commodities’ supply chains can obfuscate the provenance of products. Combine that with a half-century of farming management strategies that prioritized higher yields of commodity crops, often with copious amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The result: depleted topsoil and decreased farm productivity, often leading to a continuous cycle of increased fertilizer inputs to supplement ever-degraded soil.

A number of soil-enhancing land-management strategies have been sprouting among food and ag companies, part of a larger movement of sustainable agriculture and its first cousin, regenerative agriculture.

Companies all along the food chain — from agricultural cooperative Land O’Lakes to retail behemoth Walmart to seed and ag chemical company Monsanto (acquired by German chemical giant Bayer in 2018) — have begun to embrace these strategies to meet sustainability goals, safeguard the resilience of supply chains, meet increasing demand for climate-friendly products and ensure prolonged profitability and reduced risk.

The toolkit of sustainable land-management strategies includes those rooted in pre-industrial era agricultural, forestry and ranching techniques, some employed by indigenous peoples. To name a few: cover cropping, crop rotation, no- or low-till farming, silvopasture, regenerative grazing management, applying compost as fertilizer, integrated pest management, planting perennials and carbon farming. The specific region, type of soil and crop variety are all key in deciding which strategies will provide optimal results.

Making the transition can be tricky. Long-term investments and increased labor costs are associated with some of these practices, which can have estimated annual returns of about $100 per acre. So, the most effective levers to influence sustainable soil health measures in supply chains involve offering economic incentives to producers, entering partnerships with other leaders and grounding these efforts in regional contexts.

For Kellogg’s, General Mills and Wrangler, incentives include providing measurement tools to agricultural suppliers to help them assess the current state of their land; paying for conservation consulting and workshops, such as regenerative agriculture expert Gabe Brown’s technical advice; and offering preferred access to specific crop markets for farmers that report sustainability progress. More needs to be done, of course, including directing private-capital flows looking to invest in nature-based climate solutions towards these soil initiatives.

More needs to be done, including directing private-capital flows looking to invest in nature-based climate solutions. There’s money to be made. Philanthropists, asset managers and impact investors are looking at an estimated $2.3 trillion opportunity. The Regenerative Agriculture Investor Network (RAIN) convenes these investors annually and develops reports about the state of private capital in regenerative agriculture. However, this space is notoriously underdeveloped: Less than 5 percent of philanthropic capital in the United States is invested in rural solutions. Microfinancing has been the traditional method of investing in rural areas of developing countries — but that has been focused primarily on conventional, not sustainable agriculture. Still, with socially and environmentally responsible investing on the rise, and with the expansion of voluntary carbon markets, such as blockchain-based platform Nori, the area is ripe for growth.

Partnerships are one preferred approach by companies, such as pursuing close supply-chain relationships, public-private-partnerships, landscape alliances and research institutions. Collaborations of this nature are key to implementing more sustainable land-management strategies: They can encourage farmers to use cover crops and other regenerative methods by ensuring that these things will be valued in the marketplace.

Soil-focused organizations such as the Soil Health Institute — which partners with The Nature Conservancy, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and Field to Market, along with General Mills and the Walton Family Foundation (the giving arm of Walmart’s founding family) — also offer numerous opportunities to support soil-healthy practices. These include a funding pool, information, research project assessments and collaborations and education.

One major move recently has involved establishing standards for measurements of soil health, so that scientists, farmers, managers and retailers can speak the same language. Another nonprofit, Carbon Underground, partners with companies such as Unilever’s subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s, General Mills’ subsidiary Annie’s Homegrown and Danone North America — specifically through its recently launched soil health research initiative — to conduct rigorous soil research for farmer participants, including sampling, analysis reports and training.

For many companies, such research leads to creating sample test bed sites. They allow growers to quantify test soil health measures in local contexts to find the most effective practices, as soil type varies by location. There are more upcoming opportunities for public-private partnering, especially with local governments, thanks to the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill by President Donald Trump. It extends the funding for programs that incentivize farmers to adopt environmentally beneficial soil health management, nutrient stewardship and carbon sequestering strategies. There’s even a pilot program to assess the economic opportunity of carbon sequestering land-management strategies.

It’s early days, but these are promising signs. With recent reports warning of the massive impacts of our current farming practices — up to 80 percent of the carbon in the world’s soil has been released already, with agriculture as a growing source of GHG emissions — it’s time to hit the ground running.

Key players to watch



General Mills — it hired a soil scientist to lead sustainability programs after realizing most of its emissions came from suppliers and farmers. It has invested millions in testing better land management strategies.

Land O’Lakes — the member-owned agricultural cooperative has a sustainability branch, SUSTAIN, that focuses on soil health. With its own technology platform, Truterra, farmers can synthesize soil, weather, economic and farm management data.

Midwest Row Crop Collaborative — this coalition of companies and conservation groups throughout the Upper Mississippi River Basin of the United States is working to ensure that farmers there are trained in conservation methods.

Patagonia — long a leader in regenerative agriculture, it is developing a stricter certification with ""regenerative organic"" practices. The clothing and gear company, which also has a food subsidiary, focuses on soil health in its agriculture and ranching practices.

Soil Health Institute — it partners with multinational corporations, universities, NGOs and government agencies to conduct and apply research, as well as to ensure the adoption of soil-focused land management practices and technologies.","Soil quality is a growing focus in the sustainability space, and for good reason: Fertile soil naturally stabilizes the climate and ensures resilient supply chains.

17,"Dec 3, 2020",WJTV,New craft brewery coming to Belhaven district in 2021,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – After a hometown Jackson brewery closed its doors a year ago, plans for a new craft brewery is the latest addition to the heart of Jackson’s historic Belhaven neighborhood.

”It’s something that Jackson hasn’t had,” said Jonathan Miles.

The brewery is part of a bigger project called the Laundry Market. Fertile Ground will be the lead tenant in the 19,000 square foot of the former Baptist Medical Center linen facility, as a part of an adaptive reuse development.

“You’ll see some retail in there, possibly another food, brewery— it’s a food a beverage,” said developer, David Turner.

Turner said this has been a plan in the works for at least eight years, and it finally took when he was approached by co-founder, Matthew McLaughlin, for a Jackson-focused brewery.

“I’m interested in a kind of a cool, outdoor lifestyle vibe down here. Breweries tend to promote that so thinking, running, biking, urban, so we’ll be tracking toward some retailer who will fill that space,” said Turner, “7,000 foot space inside the building behind us, and we’ve got about 7,000 feet of outdoor space as well which is important for the nature of a brewery.”

Neighbors are excited, too. Jonathan Miles works in the area and is looking forward to the addition.

“It’s good that somebody had the idea to get that in here and maybe inject that into the community. Maybe add some capital, revitalize some things in Belhaven neighborhood,” he stated.

Belhaven Town Center is said to be built upon old soul, but with a new heartbeat. The Town Center is currently home to Campbell’s craft donuts and tacos, Elvie’s All-Day Cafe and Spectrum Sip.

Construction is expected to begin Spring 2021 and open by Fall 2021. The brewery’s name will be Fertile Ground Beer.

19,"Oct 18, 2018",HubcitySPOKES.com,Mississippi does nothing to discourage predatory lending,"A state as poor and undereducated as Mississippi is fertile ground for those in the usury business.

People of modest means have few places they can go for a loan when they get into a financial bind.

If they have credit cards, odds are they’ve maxed out their limits. The banks don’t want to lend to them because of the high risk and low reward of doing so.

Their family members are just as broke and don’t have it to lend.

So, to get by, they resort to payday loans, title loans, check-into-cash loans and other ultra-high-interest financing.

This may get them past a current crisis, but it winds up putting them into even worse shape, causing them to go back again and again to the lenders, each time digging themselves deeper and deeper into debt.

The borrowers may never do the math to realize that the interest they are paying may be 10 times or more what even the most outrageous credit-card companies charge.

They need protection from themselves and from those who would take advantage of their economic troubles and educational deficits.

Yet, Mississippi has gone in the opposite direction, passing laws to make its most economically vulnerable even more so.

As Mississippi Today, the online news site, reported this week, when the administration of former President Barack Obama looked as if it was going to rein in the payday loan industry with tougher federal regulations, the Mississippi Legislature created an avenue to bypass them.

It authorized, with the urging of small-dollar lenders, a new product for making installment loans of up to $2,500 and charging interest at an annual percentage rate of almost 300 percent.

Over a year’s time, the amount of interest on these loan winds up being more than double the amount borrowed.

That’s sinful.

There should be a law against it, not a law for it.

Other states have enacted such prohibitions.

In fact, eighteen states, according to Mississippi Today, outlaw extremely high interest rates on small-dollar loans.

Others are in the process of trying to enact limits. Mississippi, meanwhile, hasn’t budged.

Admittedly, these small loans to people of modest means are risky.

To make up for the high percentage of loans the lenders will write off as uncollectable, they have to get a higher return from those who will pay.

Without it, this source of credit could completely dry up, leaving only knuckle-breaking loan sharks in their place.

How high is a fair return?

Many states are gravitating toward capping interest rates at 24 percent to 36 percent annually.

That range sounds reasonable both for lenders willing to assume the risk they won’t be repaid and for borrowers left with no other option.","A state as poor and undereducated as Mississippi is fertile ground for those in the usury business.

21,"Nov 2, 2019",Delta Business Journal,Dr. Tyrone Jackson – One of the Hardest Working Educators in the Mississippi Delta,"The Mississippi Delta has long been a fertile ground providing opportunity for those in and around it. The jobs provided can be an educational ladder to bigger and better opportunities for anyone willing to climb. For Rosedale native, Dr. Tyrone Jackson, his first job was that of a newspaper delivery boy. His latest job was announced last March (took office on July 1) is that of the ninth president and first African American President of Mississippi Delta Community College. The office of president at MDCC has been the culmination of dreams, inspiration and hard work. And a few extra paper routes along the way.

“I knew I wanted to be in education,” says Dr. Jackson. “Originally, I wanted to be a high school history teacher.”

After attending West Bolivar High School in Rosedale, Dr. Jackson travelled to Cleveland where he attained his Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology, a Master’s Degree and Doctorate in Education. But it was his part-time jobs that helped provide the opportunity to be a Statesmen.

“I financed my education through my paper route back in Rosedale,” he says. “A paper route definitely builds character – rain, sleet or snow, the newspaper has to go.”

Paper routes work on commission so Dr. Jackson had to collect from his subscribers in order to get paid. Not only did he collect but he doubled his route from 200 to 400 people in Rosedale. But when he came to Delta State, he learned more about the rich Delta soil and what it can provide non-farmers.

“I worked at the Delta State golf course. I ran the pro shop and sometimes in charge of watering the fairways and greens. And that’s how I financed my education initially, he says.

But using the same skills that he increased his newspaper subscriber base, Jackson came to know those who frequented the golf course and in providing them excellent customer service, they saw more opportunity for him.

“There was an opening in the Recruiting Office at Delta State and customers who came in knew about the opening and encouraged me to apply for it,” says Dr. Jackson. “Bessie Elliot,

Director of Recruiting at the time and Dr. Wayne Blansett, Vice President for Student Affairs at the time, hired me.”

Much like doubling his paper route, Dr. Jackson’s work ethic and demeanor helped DSU experience significant growth in enrollment, particularly minority enrollment.

That four-year job was part of his 14-years on campus as a student and employee. He moved in the Housing Office as associate director of housing working for Elsie Lynn Ervin where he managed residence halls and two apartment complexes. He coupled that with advising campus Greek organizations. He drew upon his time as a member of the oldest historically African American fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha.

“Basically, I was the advisor for historically black Greek organizations at Delta State,” says Dr. Jackson.

After five years behind that desk of sorts, Dr. Jackson transitioned to the academic side of his career at Delta State. He was tasked with reuniting the graduate studies division from several educational schools to one.

“The graduate school was decentralized. I was charged with centralizing admissions processes and other graduate-related functions under the auspices of a single department.”

Working with Dr. Paul Starkey, Dean of the Graduate School, Dr. Jackson served as the Director of Graduate Studies before moving up to the position of Assistant Dean of Graduate and Continued Studies and his last position at DSU was interim Dean of the Graduate School and Continuing Education for the next five years. He even found his way onto other

Delta area college campuses as an adjunct professor at DSU, MVSU, MDCC and Coahoma CC.

“I taught everything from dual enrollment courses all the way up to doctorate level courses,” he says.

The Delta native then found his way into the community college system with on campus permanent jobs where he flourished while improving the schools he became associated with. First at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community, as Associate Vice President for Student Services for the District and also at the Jefferson Davis Campus as Dean of Student Services. His “job hat collection” accumulated as helped with leading the Student Services Departments of Admissions and Records, Financial Aid, Counseling, Student Activities, Fitness Center, Testing and Police Operations.

That career success brought him to Hinds Community College, the state’s largest community college, as Associate

Vice President for Student Services/Dean of Students, and as Vice President for the Utica Campus and District Dean of Students. While there he heard about the opening in Moorhead and was soon on his way “home” to the Delta to apply all of his skills and knowledge to the MDCC campus from behind the college’s President’s desk. But he owes it all to a former teacher who put him on the path to becoming a teacher. A tough one who lived to teach and not just have students memorize facts.

“I’ve had a solid foundation to prepare me for this position,” says Dr. Jackson. “I had strong teachers in high school but it was, Carrie Ann Bell (now deceased) my biology teacher who also taught me chemistry – she inspired me to be a teacher. She was such a brilliant person and was all about academic excellence. She didn’t use any notes and she wrote on the chalkboard from the time class started until the bell rang. She basically challenged us up one

side and down the other.”

The new president rates her as the toughest teacher he’s had including all of his college level classes. Her teaching gave him an appreciation and understanding what a real educator is even though his own grades didn’t show it all the time in her class.

“You would take a test from her and think you may have an ‘A’ on it and when you get it back you may have a 75 or 80 or failed it. Basically, in high school you regurgitate things back on a test. But in her classroom, it was totally different. You had to know the material and be able to apply the material in a real-life scenario. I can remember vividly my first test in her classroom and I got it back and there were red marks from beginning to end and I made an ‘F’ on it. You needed to study, know the material and be able to apply it.”

Dr. Jackson admits he didn’t like it as a student but now from behind his president’s desk, he is grateful for her

teaching style and demeanor.

“While she was living, I conveyed my appreciation and I even spoke at her funeral,” he says.

And all that he learned outside the classroom about the Delta area he grew up in has helped Dr. Jackson as he takes on the challenges at MDCC. He’s been traveling the seven-county area that MDCC primarily serves promoting and getting the positive messages out about what a Trojan education can do for students.

“I’m out and about in high schools, meeting with the board of supervisors, talking to the communities to find out what the needs are,” says Dr. Jackson. “I’m speaking at Rotary and Lions Clubs in all of these counties every week. And I converse with the audience to find out what the needs are because I want Mississippi Delta Community College to be the college of choice in the Mississippi Delta region. I want to meet these needs and basically be a catalyst to address those needs in the area.”

In his first few months, Dr. Jackson is “doing a lot of listening now” but notes the college had a 5.1 percent increase in enrollment this year and he wants to “put a lot of effort into enrollment management efforts. Not only do we need to get them here but retain them. I’m big on campus image. The actual third reason people choose a college is simply campus appearance. I’m big on grass being cut low, weeding and edging. Those are my pet peeves. I tell my maintenance crew all the time, a coat of paint makes a world of difference.”

In addition, Dr. Jackson has a facilities list of needs that include a new men’s residence hall, the new administration building, a new law enforcement training academy building and the arts.

“I’d like to see us have a new band hall,” he says. “We hired a new band director in late summer and we’ve given him the charge to re-institute the band.”

With thoughts of his former teachers who shaped him, Dr. Jackson is looking to keep and hire the best faculty members he can find.

“I want to continue our efforts to attract the best faculty and staff here at MDCC” he says.

Vocational and workforce training is high on his list of priorities as well.

“We’re going to continue to access what the needs are in our area and we’ll provide those training opportunities to address them,” he says. “We want to be the

educational provider for vocational and workforce.”

And as funds from the state have been limited for community colleges, Dr. Jackson will be looking to raise money to help meet the college’s needs both inside

and out of the classroom.

“I want to lead the efforts and assist students and staff in maximizing our assets,” he says. “I want to make sure we’re hitting on all eight cylinders.

While his day job doesn’t leave a lot of time for hobbies, Dr. Jackson has found time to serve on numerous boards. He has served as a board member for Habitat for Humanity, United Way, United Village and graduated from Delta Emerging Leaders and Leadership Mississippi. While on the Coast, he served on the Harrison County Youth Leadership and Gulfport Chamber of Commerce Boards and he is a graduate of Mississippi Community College Leadership Academy and a graduate of Leadership Gulf Coast. But of

all the honors and accolades surrounding his name, he is proudest to be married to Kashanta and is father of two children, Tyler (12) and Kennedi (8).

“Watching my children. He plays baseball and she’s in drama club, a cheerleader and takes dance lessons. Spending quality time with them is of upmost importance to me. I like travelling and seeing new places, particularly exposing my kids to places I only dreamed of as a child.”","“I knew I wanted to be in education,” says Dr. Jackson.

22,"Nov 30, 2018",Jackson Free Press,"Bloomberg Gives $1 Million for Jackson Art; Talks 2020 Plans, Stop-and-Frisk"," The small-statured, thick-accented former billionaire mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, descended upon Jackson on Nov. 29 to announce a $1-million public-art grant, while perhaps putting out feelers for a 2020 presidential bid.

At a small downtown parklet in the shadow of the Governor's Mansion and in eyeshot of the Mississippi Capitol, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba joined Bloomberg and other city and state leaders to celebrate funding for ""Fertile Ground,"" a public-art project designed to inspire dialogue about food access.

""We welcome you to the deep-fried South,"" Lumumba said in his introductory remarks. ""We take often a lot of cultural pride in our food and our history here. ... Many of the things that we cook and take pride in today are because our forefathers and foremothers had limited access to fresh fruit and fresh opportunities. When you go all the way back to the plantation, people cooked things that they had available to them.""

After some pleasantries about the beautiful fall day, Bloomberg talked about the role of public art in cities. He said the Statue of Liberty is probably one of the best examples of public art reaching people and delivering a powerful message.

""I've always believed that arts are a smart investment for cities,"" Bloomberg said. ""Art makes cities more beautiful and enjoyable places to live, and I've always thought that culture attracts capital a lot more than capital attracts culture.""

He said this tends to set off a cycle of artists being driven out as droves of people flock to the city everyone wants to live in, and artists move on to do the same thing in the next city. Although Jackson's planning department is working hard to ensure no one gets priced out of Jackson as it undergoes development, the art community will get a boost from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

""Our judges—I was not one of them—were impressed with your project called 'Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access.' Food access, as we all know, is an important topic both here and around the country,"" Bloomberg said. ""This will be a community-wide effort I hope that not only leads to greater access to healthy food here in Jackson, but that it also inspires a conversation that spreads out across our country.""

About Fertile Ground

More than 200 cities with populations of 30,000 or more submitted proposals for temporary art projects around civic issues. Fertile Ground will bring together artists, architects, filmmakers, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, and community members to create a city-wide exhibition to address the vast number of fast-food restaurants in the area and the lack of access to healthier options.

In 2017, Physician's Weekly labeled Jackson as the fattest city in America.

""In spite of all these problems, we can almost never have a comfortable conversation about food,"" Mukesh Kumar, director of the City's planning department, said. ""Most of the time it goes into judgmental points, and we typically just gloss over the entire thing. So we figured the best way to handle it is actually through public art.""

Kumar said this project is rooted in the mayor's commitment to food justice, healthy citizens and affordable quality of life for every citizens, but it is also a testament to the tenacity and hard work of the City's Department of Planning and Development.

This project will take place across three sites.

The Ecoshed is situated between Fondren and the Virden Addition on the other side of the tracks, one of the blackest and poorest areas of the city. Fondren, originally a suburb of Jackson, has been split in recent decades between mostly white residents on the east side of North Street with more African Americans on the west side, but has become more mixed as whites and some businesses have moved in over the last decade. The installation here will make use of the open-roof, courtyard-style building to develop a floating installation about food sovereignty and the food system.

The Galloway Elementary playfield sits behind a thoroughfare of fast-food eateries on Woodrow Wilson Drive. The installation would be a large land bank, or ""berm,"" to block the school's view of the ""food swamp.""

Cindy Ayers, who operates Footprint Farms in Jackson will help with this initiative.

""We've always taken a stand about having access,"" Ayers told the Jackson Free Press. ""For me, it's all about making a difference holistically. I think our City is truly moving, and our mayor understands the importance of what it takes to be a healthy city. To have Mayor Bloomberg say this is a place to do some things, I'm sure it's going to cause more pleasant activities, more investors coming in.... I'm so proud to be a farmer, I'm so proud to be a citizen of Jackson.""

The third installation will be downtown on Congress Street near the Governor's mansion. It will expand upon the parklet where Bloomberg made his announcement with more lighting and furniture with the help of an AARP grant. A mural from Adrienne Dominick and Scott Allen will go in the alley on Congress Street, and an experimental food lab will go into the 426 Capitol Street building, one of developer Kip Gilbert's recent purchases. Chef Nick Wallace will help with the food aspect.

Salam Rida, urban designer with the planning department, who also co-designed the parklet with fellow designer Travis Crabtree, hopes the project will help with long-term planning in Jackson.

""I'm very excited to be part of the public-art challenge. I think it's great not only for Jackson but for the whole State of Mississippi,"" she said. ""I think it's really invigorating to have someone on a national presence being here in Jackson. I think it really shows not only the City's commitment but a national commitment, which I think is hopefully going to encourage other people who could potentially invest in the City.""

Bloomberg for President?

The interaction between the two mayors was jovial, but this was not their first time meeting. This summer, Mayor Lumumba was part of the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative, a three-day, immersive classroom experience for 40 mayors across the world. Through a partnership with the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School, the training gives mayors who may not have a lot of management experience the skills they need to be effective, Bloomberg said.

""We got to know each other in New York, and you're very lucky to have this guy,"" Bloomberg said of Lumumba.

In response to a TV reporter's question about a potential 2020 bid, Bloomberg said he will give more thought to it in the beginning of 2019.

""If I had an opportunity to do something in Washington, I would certainly think long and hard about it,"" he said. ""But what I'm trying to do now is to go around the country and talk to people and listen and see what's on their minds and how receptive they would be, and there are plenty of other people who will probably run, and we'll see what happens.""

Bloomberg on 'Stop and Frisk' in New York

During a question-and-answer session immediately following the announcement, this reporter asked about Bloomberg's controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" policing program from the early 2000s, and whether or not he had suggestions for Jackson, a city in the thick of police reform.

Mayor Lumumba quickly interjected to clear Jackson's association with the controversial strategy, which was greatly reduced in New York City after a federal judge found that it targeted mostly black and Hispanic people and was, thus, racial profiling.

""I do want to emphasize this point, the City of Jackson does not have stop-and-frisk; we do have food insecurities,"" Lumumba said. ""I think that as we look at the best outcomes and the best ways to protect our cities, we need to be able to have fruitful dialogue in how we accomplish that. We can't take reductive measures when there are so many things our communities are faced with, and right now we're talking about the food insecurities that our food insecurities are dealing with.""

Like someone preparing to re-enter the public eye, Bloomberg did not shy away from any line of questioning about the controversial stop-and-frisk strategy that began under previous Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, but exploded when he was mayor from 2001 until 2013 with Raymond Kelly as police commissioner.

""I'm not familiar with the crime here in Jackson, everybody's got some crime, and some places it's terrible, and some places it seems to be at low-level, although any crime is more than you want,"" Bloomberg said.

""When I got into office back in 2002, we had 650 people getting killed every year, when I left, it was down to about 300 people.... Crime is a problem, and crime unfortunately generally is something that hurts young people. Certainly the violence in the streets is a young person's problem, and so we've just got to do something about it.""

Young black men in Jackson's Washington Addition have told the Jackson Free Press they have been stopped and frisked by Jackson police officers for no reason.

A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the stop-and-frisk practice was unconstitutional and the New York chapter of the ACLU found that since 2002 when Bloomberg trumped up stop-and-frisk as his signature public-safety program, New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since. Fifty percent of those stops every year since then have targeted African Americans, with Latinos as a close second. The NYCLU says nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent.

Crime did fall in New York City under Bloomberg, but crime nationwide has been on a downward trajectory since the 1990s. Crime rates remained low after the judge ordered a rollback of the discriminatory practice.

Bloomberg, a former Republican who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, also managed to touch upon climate change, the NRA and his legacy as a three-term mayor in New York City—clear national talking points. New York City has strong gun-control laws; stop-and-frisk practices were designed to take weapons from New Yorkers, as well as find people with outstanding warrants.

""I focused very hard then and now as a private citizen on fighting the NRA,"" Bloomberg said in Jackson. ""We need background checks on people who have criminal records, or psychiatric problems, or minors shouldn't be able to buy guns. That's what we worked on, and we were very successful in bringing down crime. I'm happy to say that my successor has kept crime down; In fact, it's a touch lower since he came into office than it was when we left.""

Email city reporter Ko Bragg at [email protected].","""Our judges—I was not one of them—were impressed with your project called 'Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access.'
Food access, as we all know, is an important topic both here and around the country,"" Bloomberg said.
To have Mayor Bloomberg say this is a place to do some things, I'm sure it's going to cause more pleasant activities, more investors coming in....

24,"Sep 8, 2020",The Architect's Newspaper,"The New Orleans–based Jonathan Tate talks hurricanes, homes, and hotels","Architect Jonathan Tate was living and working in Memphis when Hurricane Katrina ensnared New Orleans. Instinctively drawn to the Big Easy, he later moved there for the opportunity to observe the reconstruction effort and investigate architecture’s role in it.

“Embedded in the practice from the beginning was a desire to look around and postulate,” said Tate, referring to the namesake office he founded in the Lower Garden District in 2011.

Indeed, Office of Jonathan Tate (OJT) brings a probing, “investigative” (the word and its cognates have a special resonance for the small firm) spirit to wide-ranging issues relevant to New Orleans. Its projects, which span everything from low-rise housing to planning initiatives, often combine research with philanthropic funding and aspects of community building.

But however diverse its portfolio, OJT has become virtually synonymous with the Starter Home* series it has developed over the better part of the past decade. These contemporary takes on speculative urban infill were awarded the 2018 AIA National Housing Award and the 2019 AIA National Honor Award (for 3016 St. Thomas and No. 4-15, Saint Thomas/Ninth, respectively), and cemented the firm’s selection for the 2020 American Academy of Arts and Letters Architecture Prize back in April.

“Our investigations started off with a very purposeful [question], ‘How can we knock down barriers?’” said designer Maggie Lloyd, alluding to OJT’s first foray into the Starter Home* series six years ago. In turn, the office gained insights—about market dynamics, say, and architecture’s complicity in pernicious socioeconomic narratives—that “have permeated everything else that we do,” Lloyd added.

Recently, OJT has been expanding the scope of its practice to the surrounding region and designing spaces for experimental nonprofit development models. Seeing New Orleans redefine itself after Katrina helped Tate and his team (which currently numbers nine) understand that every city is always going to be rebuilding in some way. “It allowed us to be more adaptable to malleable urban situations,” Lloyd said.

3609-13 S. Saratoga Starter Home* (2019)

Like the two previous “generations” in OJT’s Starter Home* project, the S. Saratoga Street homes are a contemporary twist on affordable speculative housing aimed at first-time homeowners. The new infill units re-subdivide irregular New Orleans lots and incorporate contextual cues into their architecture for added depth. Developed in partnership with the real estate investing platform Small Change, the nation’s first equity crowdfunded single-family units work to address housing inequalities, Tate said. The projects, he added, examine “the economics around housing” and consider “why thoughtful design wasn’t available in a speculative market.”

Ground Notations (2020)

Created as a part of the public art installation Fertile Ground in Jackson, Mississippi, Ground Notations works to reconceptualize land use and educate residents about food insecurity. The site-specific installation inscribes industrial farming patterns across the historic Smith Park in the heart of the city. The geometrically ordered row crops, long bench seating, and ground mural were completed in April, but the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the official opening of the project and the corresponding Fertile Ground Expo to 2021.

Magazine Street and Travelers Hotels (2020–)

In addition to affordable housing and public art, OJT has been developing a new operational model for boutique urban hotels that leverages local artist communities toward boosting small-town tourism. “It’s a play on an affordable housing model wrapped around a business model,” Tate said. Travelers Hotel in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and the soon-to-be-completed Magazine Street hotel in New Orleans are managed by artist co-ops, whose members are afforded apartments and studio spaces above the guest rooms.","Architect Jonathan Tate was living and working in Memphis when Hurricane Katrina ensnared New Orleans.

Albert Sykes

Community Organizer

Albert Sykes grew up in Jackson's Shady Oaks neighborhood. His first view of something other than the blighted neighborhood came in the form of Bob Moses' Algebra Project in sixth grade. Moses' influence and Sykes' realization that he was in a state that refuses to fully fund education but still holds schools accountable for the types of students they produce defined his purpose in life.

""That was the first time that I discovered that in this country you don't have a constitutional right to education,"" Sykes says. ""I knew coming out of high school that I wasn't doing anything else but community-organizing and community-organizing around education.""

He helped found Young People's Project, an out-birth of Bob Moses' Algebra Project that trains young people to teach their peers mathematics, in 1997.

The 36-year-old father of four is active in the Our JPS Coalition, made up of people and community organizations who oppose the state takeover of Jackson Public Schools, and is a member of the NAACP State Education Committee. He currently serves as executive director of the Institute of Democratic Education in American, or IDEA, whose work centers around protecting public education. He hopes that IDEA can change the negative image of public education, especially in Mississippi.

""We try to show people that wherever you can point and see a bad school, we can show you some great students and some great educators that are doing the best that they can with the little that they have been given,"" he says.

Sykes hopes that his work will create a legacy in Mississippi that he can proudly leave to his sons.—Torsheta Jackson

Chrissy Cheshire

Rescuer

Chrissy Cheshire, 32, knew she needed to make a difference when she saw the amount of dogs in a local animal shelter who needed homes. In 2011, she began her small nonprofit charity Cheshire Abbey after serving on the board of Community Animal Rescue & Adoptions, or CARA, in Jackson.

Cheshire was born in Louisiana. Her family moved to Jackson when she was in seventh grade She graduated from Jackson Academy in 1998 and then graduated from Mississippi College in 2002 with a bachelor's degree in communications.

She describes Cheshire Abbey as ""a nonprofit ministry that helps animals anyway we can in our community and out of our community as well.

""We just do whatever we can whenever we can with the funds that we have,"" Cheshire says.

As a nonprofit business, Cheshire Abbey functions solely off the work of Cheshire herself and many volunteers. Her normal day of work can be filled with any surprises that may be expected when running a business, she says. ""Every day is a new adventure,"" she says.

When she and others rescue the dogs, foster homes throughout the community take them in, but Cheshire herself will also take the animals in if they are in need of more hands-on attention or medical assistance. In some cases, these foster homes eventually become permanent homes through the process of adoption.

""Although we lose a foster home, it is a gratifying feeling to see these dogs finally find a nurturing home,"" she says.

Cheshire hopes that her actions provoke a change to the laws toward animals in Mississippi. For more information, visit cheshireabbey.com.—Taylor Williams

Damarco Gibbs

Entrepreneur

Damarco Gibbs, owner of It'z a Wrap MS, was 19 when he started working for his brother Oscar in Madison, Miss. That job introduced him to the business of tinting car windows. Then, after watching ""Taxi,"" Gibbs had the idea to sell ""color-changing car vinyl wraps.

""There's a scene in the movie during their attempt to escape where they pull the film off the car, and it's an entirely different color underneath,"" he says.

Gibbs was working for Oscar at PWT Customz Building, but he always had the desire to follow his own path. He also wanted to do something that would inspire the young people around him.

When he was 23, he used $200 to buy some self-adhesive film, and by following instructional videos on YouTube, he completed his first job: wrapping his own Dodge Charger in a powder blue color.

In 2013, he noticed interest for this product, so he went to Jacksonville, Fla., to get a car-wrapping certification at Hexis, a manufacturer of self-adhesive films for marketing. Same year, Gibbs returned to Mississippi and started his business.

""My first customers were relatives, but I started using social media to advertise,"" Gibbs says. ""Fellow car enthusiasts were enthralled with the idea that they could change the color of their vehicle without damaging the paint underneath.""

Gibbs notes that even with the growing popularity of color-changing wraps, he felt like something was missing from his business, so he began researching film types for commercial wraps.

""I ordered the machine to print commercial graphics, taught myself Photoshop and started printing my first commercial projects,"" he says.

Inspiration for the idea came when he began to receive calls from commercial clients such as dealerships looking for ways to spruce up their vehicles and attract buyers, he says.

Now, Gibbs, 29, has wrapped vehicles for companies from a number of states from Louisiana to New York, and some nonprofits. He has also opened a new location in Pearl, Miss.—Mauricio J. Quijano

Elizabeth Henry

Empowerer

Elizabeth Henry's passion is working to reduce the disparities that under-represented populations face. The 30-year-old Jackson native is the program director for Thriving in Ministry, an initiative at Millsaps College that provides women in ministry a network of support.

In its inaugural year, the program will support a cohort of 22 senior, solo or associate female pastors.""I'm really excited about this because it is a way to empower people who are truly called, but are often under-resourced,"" Henry says.

Empowerment is central to her calling. As a campus minister for the Wesley Connexion, she seeks to connect students through faith-based programs on campus. Henry says the organization is an opportunity to unite the student population by hearing and addressing their concerns.

""We realize that Millsaps is a very diverse campus, so we want everyone to have a space where they feel safe, respected and able to connect with God however that makes sense for them,"" she says.

Her work is deeply rooted in the belief that all people should experience love and safety. ""For people who that has not been true physically, I want them to feel safe and loved by God and among God's people,"" she says, ""whether that's (LGBT) persons, persons of color or people from different nations ... whatever systems we need to put in place to ensure that is the case or whatever relationships we need to build, I want to empower people to be most able to use the gifts that God has given (them).""—Torsheta Jackson

Jauan Knight

Influencer

Jauan Knight has a heart for helping young people. ""It's always been my passion to help young people and especially those who look like me and who grew up in communities like me, who don't have (a lot),"" he says.

As an undergraduate student at JSU, it became important to Knight to be active in the community. He volunteered with Planned Parenthood Generation Action and Organizers for Action Mississippi, interned with the American Civil Liberties Union and was active in the Student Government Association. Seeing a need for political activism by young people, Knight joined Hinds County Young Democrats and helped organize the JSU Young Democrats. He is also the founder of the JSU Mass Choir.

This summer, he served as a camp counselor for Camp 360, a week-long residential camp that Jackson Revival Center, or JRC, sponsors. He also works with the JRC Millennials, the church's young adult ministry.

Now an undergraduate recruiter for JSU, Knight, 23, remains a member of the Hinds Young Democrats with plans to volunteer for several campaigns this fall. He also remains active with the choir he f ounded, acting as its staff adviser. For him, it is all part of being a model youth can follow.

""I feel like that is an area I've been called to while I still have influence because I'm still young,"" he says. ""I want to take full advantage of my influence.""—Torsheta Jackson

Linda Sermons

Hopegiver

Hope Lodge Head Manager Linda Sermons describes her main job as ""making sure the building doesn't fall down,"" she says. She also places importance on making sure her guests are comfortable, giving them what they need and someone to talk to.

""Just seeing a smile as they walk through the door can make their day,"" Sermons says.

Hope Lodge gives a home away from home to cancer patients who are receiving treatments from hospitals around the area. Each patient gets a private room and caregiver; space to socialize with each other, workers, volunteers, family members and friends; access to a washer and dryer; and more benefits.

Sermon's parents, Mississippi natives Jessie and Bettye Bracey, raised her in Worchester, N.Y. As a junior in high school, her family moved back to Mississippi, and she graduated from Murrah High School in 2006. Her bond with her northern home then drew her to New York for two years.

While working at a call center, her urge to give back to her community grew stronger. In August 2017, Sermons decided to apply with the American Cancer Society in Jackson and became the coordinator at the corporate office here.

""I was looking for something where it did matter when I went to work; it made a difference,"" she says. ""I knew I had a bigger purpose. (I) didn't realize it was going to be this, but I knew I had a bigger purpose.""

She was involved in the preparing of the groundbreaking plans for Hope Lodge in Jackson.

Under her management, Sermons, 31, plans to not only improve the Hope Lodge experience for those involved, but to also strengthen the bond that has blossomed between the community of Jackson and the Hope Lodge, she says.—Taylor Williams

Sam Humphrey

Ecofarmer

After hearing that Boulder, Colo., was one of the fittest cities in the 2016 Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index, Jackson native Sam Humphrey wondered how that healthy population could serve as a model for his hometown to combat the various health challenges that Jacksonians face.

""How could I connect those two populations of people?"" he mused.

The 27-year-old Jackson native graduated from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, N.C., in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in environmental science, concentrating on sustainable agriculture. Prior to his tenure at Warren Wilson, he attended the University of Colorado in Boulder.

In answer to his question about how a fit city like Boulder could serve as a model for Jackson, he started Fertile Ground Farms in January 2019. The business, which currently operates out of the Ecoshed west of Fondren, is a regenerative urban farm that uses no chemicals on its plants.

Currently, Humphrey grows vegetables such as sweet peppers, cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes. He sells to locations like Urban Foxes, Green Ghost Tacos, Walker's Drive-In and the Farmer's Table at the Mississippi Farmers Market. ""I want to stay within the city limits,"" he says. ""There's no reason for this food to travel.""

He is also managing farming sites for the Fertile Ground Project, which seeks to improve the city's access to healthy food.

The nonprofit organization has also contracted Humphrey to plan an educational garden at Galloway Elementary School and planting an edible garden at Smith Park in a future redesign. The Ecoshed will also have a grocery store in 2020, he says.—Mike McDonald","He helped found Young People's Project, an out-birth of Bob Moses' Algebra Project that trains young people to teach their peers mathematics, in 1997.

The soil was largely infertile.

“Back in the 1960s the attitude was, we’ll put down some cover soil and it will be good,” he said.

The park had been built over a former industrial area, and Hartsig found demolition debris — bricks and wood and bottles — just a foot below the surface. The cover soil had been trucked over from Lambert International Airport, which was under construction at the time.

Hartsig described it as a very silty loam — sloppy when wet, like concrete when dry.

“But they wanted to keep as many trees as we could, and that meant we had to work with existing soils that were there, as well as bring in good soil,” he said.

Note: This is a Ted Stillwell column from several years ago.

My Indian spirit guide, Chickasaw Indian Princess Linda Hawkins, related to me an old legend about her people that went something like this:

In the days of old, the Chickasaw lived in what is now Oklahoma. Then, a great strong tribe on the warpath came down from the north, driving them from their homelands toward the east. In the daytime they were guided through the wilderness by a dog. They also had a magic pole, and at night they planted this in the ground. In the morning it leaned the way they were supposed to go.

When they crossed the great river (the Mississippi River) the poor dog drowned. So, they were stuck with only the pole, and it refused to lean anymore, so the Mississippi became their new home. Then, as many generations passed, the white man came along and drove them back to Oklahoma. That could be how they got their tribal name because Chickasaw means “to leave.”

The Chickasaw people are closely related in language and culture to the Choctaw, and both tribes have cultural ties to the Creek.

The rich, fertile soil of the Mississippi floodplain was alive with vegetation and abundant wildlife such as white-tailed deer and black bear. The Mississippi and its tributaries also offered up many kinds of fish, such as the giant catfish, sometimes weighing as much as 200 pounds. So the men went fishing and hunting and the women tilled the soil, planting corn, beans, squash, sunflowers and melons. Over time they spread out along the river in what are today Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. They built their villages on higher ground among the trees and away from flood waters. The Chickasaw houses had the pole frame construction found throughout much of the Southeast, with a variety of materials used as coverings – grass thatch, bark or hides.

Living along the Mississippi it didn’t take them long to encounter the Europeans as they came along. The Chickasaw, for the most part, had a good reputation. They practiced what some scholars called the “law of hospitality,” sharing their meager rations with anyone who came along. Their first European contact was in 1540, when Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto encountered them and even stayed in one of their towns for a while. After various disagreements between these two totally different peoples, the Chickasaw attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying them.

De Soto quickly moved along. They didn’t care much for the French either when they came calling. They had to whip a few of them just for the sport of it. In fact, no one messed much with the Chickasaw, not even their nearest neighbors, the Choctaw. It seems as though the British were the only ones the Chickasaw really took a liking to. They traded furs and pelts with them for English guns and rifles

Allied with the British, the Chickasaw were often at war with the French and those skirmishes continued until France ceded its claims to the region east of the Mississippi after being defeated in the French and Indian War.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the Chickasaw fought as allies of the new United States under General Anthony Wayne against other Indians. Following the American Civil War, the United States did give the Chickasaw problems for a few years afterward because the Chickasaw sided with the South.

Today, the Chickasaw Nation is about an hour's drive southeast of Oklahoma City, with headquarters in Ada, Oklahoma, and is one of the Five Civilized Tribes.

29,"May 21, 2020",WholeHogSports,SEC fertile ground for football's best coaches,"The best 25 college football coaches list compiled by CBSsports.com was an interesting read.

Let it be said, the website admitted it’s a subjective list made up of the opinions of its staff writers.

It also said the retirements of Urban Meyer (Ohio State) after 2018, and Chris Petersen (Washington) and Mark Dantonio (Michigan State) after last season offered some wiggle room for new coaches.

To save you the disappointment, no Arkansas Razorbacks coach made the list, although one Arkansan did.

Mark Stoops of Kentucky was the first SEC coach to show up, ranking No. 22. He has turned the Wildcats from pretenders into almost contenders in the SEC East. One remark is that if he continues his current wins-per-season pace, he will pass Bear Bryant’s 60 wins to become the Wildcats’ winningest coach at the end of next season.

Coming in at No. 18 was Fort Smith native Gus Malzahn. His agent, Jimmy Sexton, pretended Malzahn was interested in taking the Razorbacks job, and that persuaded Auburn to sign him to a $7 million a year contract. If he gets fired after this season, Auburn will owe him around $25 million.

There wasn’t another SEC coach until we got inside the top 10, which turned out to be SEC territory.

Dan Mullen at Florida was No. 8. He first made Mississippi State a winner before taking on a rebuilding job with the Gators. He is the only coach in the top 10 who hasn’t won a conference championship, but he does appear to be on his way to one. There’s a good chance he will become Razorback Nation’s favorite coach not at Arkansas, depending on how Gators transfer Feleipe Franks plays at quarterback for the Hogs.

Jimbo Fisher, Texas A&M, was No. 7. Fisher won a national championship at Florida State in 2013, which had to be why he was voted this high. In two seasons at A&M, he’s 17-9 overall and 9-7 in SEC play. He’s landed some good recruiting classes, but that’s the norm in Texas.

Kirby Smart, Georgia, was No. 6. There is no arguing the unfriendly, Nick Saban wanna-be has made the Bulldogs a contender. In the 2017 season, they were a couple of plays away from winning the national championship. Georgia is a recruiting-rich state with 40-50 high D-I players every year. His recruiting budget should be a tank of gas.

Ed Orgeron jumped from No. 30 last season to No. 4 after LSU won the national championship. It’s amazing the guy who left Ole Miss under a huge cloud of embarrassment has turned his outlook and attitude around so much. Louisiana is another state full of great athletes, and all he needs is for another Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback to fall into his lap.

Most won’t be surprised that No. 1 was Alabama’s Satan. Nick Saban has won six national championships, including his first at LSU. But the guy named No. 2, Dabo Swinney, is breathing down his neck.

Saban has a 12-year head start, but Swinney — who started as an interim coach at Clemson — may be outrunning Saban these days.

Swinney is the only coach to beat Saban more than once with the national championship on the line.

Still, Alabama had myriad problems when Saban broke his word and left the Miami Dolphins for the Crimson Tide, and he has dominated the most powerful football league in the land since his second season.

It is a little surprising that sports writers would vote him No. 1, but none of those wags cover him on a regular basis, so they don’t have to worry about Saban’s temper tantrums and acid tongue.","Mark Stoops of Kentucky was the first SEC coach to show up, ranking No.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State students studying landscape architecture, architecture and graphic design are bringing home a national honor for their learning garden concept.

A cross-college consortium of MSU students conceptualized a suite of garden designs aimed at helping schools build learning gardens based on their educational needs. The Living Room: A Freeware Learning Garden Focused on Health, Food and Nutrition Education received an Honor Award for Student Collaboration at the American Society of Landscape Architects, or ASLA. The team, which included 10 landscape architecture students, 10 architecture students and one graphic design student, was recognized at the society’s recent virtual conference.

Cory Gallo, MSU associate professor of landscape architecture in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, served as faculty advisor for the group.

“For the fifth time since 2012, the design/build studio has earned a national design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Many of these awards have been in collaboration with architecture and graphic design faculty and students, including this most recent one,” Gallo said. “The society chose only 35 awards out of 560 applicants this year. The recognition is a continued testament to the unique cross-college process that has been ongoing at Mississippi State for the last decade.”

Gallo explained the garden’s concept was further illustrated in two proof-of-concept designs—one that has been installed at Galloway Elementary School in Jackson and another scheduled for installation at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU in spring 2021.

“The team worked with educators and stakeholders to tailor the design to each site’s individual needs. For instance, the garden at Galloway Elementary emphasized ample teaching space aligned around five themes including math, science and art, which allows teachers to use the garden for almost every subject. This ensures that the garden will be used for not just food education, but as an integral part of the classroom,” Gallo said.

Hans Herrmann, MSU associate professor in the School of Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art and Design, said students benefited from the collaborative hands-on experience.

“The first-hand feedback from trying to construct what was previously just an idea is something that traditional classroom instruction cannot approximate. Issues of material supply, site conditions, transportation logistics, tools and equipment all come into focus once you are standing on the site and realize that you’re the one who has to get the job done,” he said.

Herrmann said he was proud of how multiple disciplines joined together, including MSU alumni, to bridge between areas of expertise and gaps in experience.

“The work of these projects is more than just the hours in the field building and installing the gardens. It’s about building the team, taking ownership and responsibility for key components, and working with other organizations in Mississippi to make the state we call home that much better for the next generation,” he said.

In addition to the national award, the project was featured in a chapter of “Design-Build: Integrating Craft, Service, and Research through Applied Academic Practice,” a textbook by University of Washington Landscape Architecture Professor Daniel Winterbottom which was published by Routledge this year.

In addition to Gallo and Herrmann, Associate Professor Suzanne Powney in the Department of Art’s graphic design concentration advised the graphic student on the project. Associate Professor Ryan Walker in the College of Education’s Department of Curriculum, Instruction and Special Education consulted on the project as well.

Collaborators included The Fertile Ground Project, a Jackson-based program inspiring dialogue about food access; JH&H Architects in Flowood; Utah’s Pikus Concrete; and Pennsylvania’s Significant Developments. The garden at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU is funded through a grant from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi Foundation.

32,"Dec 2, 2018",The Commercial Dispatch,The W has dreams of baseball on campus,"Two years ago, Jason Trufant had a vision for the Mississippi University for Women’s return to intercollegiate athletics.

Trufant, who was hired as the school’s director of athletics, talked to groups in the Golden Triangle to increase awareness about the revival of women’s sports and the addition to men’s sports to the four-year school in Columbus. He discovered a fertile ground for growth in a community ripe with athletic tradition in numerous sports.

Trufant also realized baseball is one of the most popular sports in the Golden Triangle. He hopes the next step in The W’s evolution taps into that popularity and helps it build its fledgling baseball program.

On Wednesday, two years after one of his initial speaking engagements at the Kiwanis Club, Trufant was back to show off designs for construction of a baseball stadium on The W’s campus.

“With the focus of the project being private donations, it is really sky’s the limit to how fast you want to go,” Trufant said. “The main focus is the field. Once you get the field and fencing in, you just go. I think that’s important to have something physically on the ground to build around.”

Designed by PryorMorrow, of Columbus, Owls Park will be located south of Pohl Gymnasium. It will feature an artificial turf playing surface, LED stadium lights, seating for 500 behind home plate, and a press box. A 20-foot outfield fence will enclose the playing surface and help the facility fit nicely in between Pohl Gymnasium and Garrett Tennis Court.

Trufant said the first phase of the estimated $5 million complex will be the field, bullpens, dugouts, and lights. Seating, a press box, a brick entrance way and surrounding brick pillars, and parking will highlight phase two. The final phase will add and cover seating as well as add a main concourse, bathrooms, and concession to the grandstand.

Trufant said other amenities could be included to complete the project.

“I am excited to see how quickly and how productively we can put this together and do what is right for the student-athletes and the campus,” Trufant said.

Trufant praised Mike Taylor and PryorMorrow for their help in developing a vision for the venue, which he hopes will be one the community and people throughout the state will be able to use.

“When people see what the purpose of the facility is, I think they will understand what the end result needs to be,” Trufant said. “I don’t want to close the doors. We want to protect the investment, without a doubt, but I think it is important for as many people to be on campus as possible and to see what we can do as a university.”

Trufant said work already has started to raise money for the project. He said he would love to see a field on the campus “within a couple of years,” but he didn’t set a timetable. He said The W won’t do anything until it is ready to move forward.

To that end, Trufant praised the school administration and his staff for supporting the effort behind the construction of Owls Park.

“It’s all a tribute to the staff,” Trufant said. “They just work hard. Without the staff we have, we can’t be where we are. Without the administrative support that we have, we couldn’t be where we are.”

Earlier this year, The W completed installation of artificial turf at the Don Usher Softball Complex and renovated the venue for that program’s return to the field. The softball and baseball teams then wrapped up the 2017-18 school year by finishing fifth at the United States Collegiate Athletic Conference (USCAA) World Series in Pennsylvania.

“Baseball and softball in the South are as big as anything else,” Trufant said. “When you invest in those two sports, you not only see great numbers come to your institution for those two sports, but you also get the ancillary benefits of other students coming to see those events being played and to be a part of that culture. Investing like we have in athletics and continuing that progression will only do wonders for the university.”

In 2018-19, the return of women’s basketball and the addition of men’s basketball have generated added enthusiasm in an athletic department that now features 12 programs.

In 2019-20, Trufant said The W plans to add indoor and outdoor track and field for men and women and lacrosse for women. He said the addition of 185 student-athletes for the 12 sports currently offered has more than covered the costs of funding an athletic program that is working through the application phase of becoming a NCAA Division III member.

Trufant hopes the number of student-athletes will grow to 250-275 in the next three years as The W completes its roster of intercollegiate athletic programs. Until then, he will continue to raise awareness about sports at The W and to help make Owls Park a reality.

“When you start talking about building facilities, you have hit another level,” Trufant said. “You’re talking about creating a great place to play. We’re at that point. We’re adding structures rather than people. That’s pretty cool.”

33,"Jun 17, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,Mississippi State’s Nikki McCray-Penson continuing national recruiting push started by Vic Schaefer,"STARKVILLE — When Nikki McCray-Penson took over for former Mississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer in late April, a foundation for success had been set.

In eight years guiding the Bulldogs before his sudden departure for Texas, Schaefer earned three-straight trips to the Elite Eight or better and took MSU to back-to-back national title games in 2017 and 2018.

And while it remains to be seen what McCray-Penson’s on-court prowess will look like in Starkville, she’s also borrowed the national recruiting footprint that made Schaefer so successful.

“Vic and his staff have done a tremendous job of making this program very attractive and a place that players want to come and be a part of something special,” McCray-Penson told The Dispatch. “For me, it’s just continuing to build on that, build on it every single day, getting the top recruits in here every single day.”

Over the past three-plus weeks, MSU has earned commitments from five-star 2020 guard Madison Hayes — who required a second round of recruiting after Schaefer left for Austin — and 2021 four-stars guards KN’isha Godfrey and Mia Moore. All ranked in the top 100 of ESPNW’s HoopGurlz rankings for their respective classes, their varying geography speaks as much to McCray-Penson’s strategy as their actual skills.

Hayes, a native Ooltewah, Tennessee, a town just 30 minutes outside of Chattanooga, became the second-straight recipient of Tennessee’s Miss Basketball crown to commit to the Bulldogs and marked the first time MSU had corralled players from the Volunteer state in back-to-back years since at least 2007.

A Tennessee native and former player under longtime UT coach Pat Summitt, McCray-Penson’s roots in the area could offer a fertile recruiting ground up the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway as the Volunteer program hasn’t reached a Final Four since 2008.

“She’s the number one all-time leading scorer (in Tennessee high school basketball history) and I’m the third all-time,” Hayes told The Dispatch. “It’s really cool. You know, I didn’t expect to play for her but I think it’s a really cool connection that we have.”

Beyond Tennessee, the Bulldogs have quickly become players in Georgia — the home state of Moore and rising junior Jessika Carter. Like Tennessee, the hometown Bulldogs have seen their footprint shrink as they’ve reached just one Elite Eight since 2004 and haven’t been to the Final Four since 1999.

With that, Carter — who finished her high school career as the No. 5 ranked player in the state — has blossomed into a second team All-SEC performer in her two years in Starkville, while Moore sits as the No. 8 player in Georgia in the 2021 class and should take over point guard duties upon Myah Taylor’s graduation.

MSU is also in the recently released top-five for No. 15 overall player and No. 1-ranked Georgia native Kayla McPherson along with North Carolina, Georgia Tech, Arizona and North Carolina State.

Another key cog in MSU’s recent pillaging of the Peach State is assistant coach Scepter Brownlee. A one-time graduate assistant for Bruce Pearl at Tennessee, Brownlee spent four years as assistant athletic director and boys’ varsity basketball coach at King’s Ridge Christian School outside Atlanta after a four year-stint as a men’s assistant coach at Georgia State between 2007 and 2011.

“Mississippi State has built with the previous staff from a facility standpoint, from a resource standpoint,” Brownlee told The Dispatch. “Everything is in place that you need to be successful. We just want to continue to build on it and raise the standard, a new level of staff here at Mississippi State.”

McCray-Penson has also shown an ability to dip into states MSU hasn’t had recent success in. With Godrey’s commitment on May 29, she became the first Floridian to pledge to the Bulldogs since Iggy Allen in the class of 2016 and LaKaris Salter in the class of 2014.

Beyond Florida, McCray-Penson snagged former U18 German national team standout Charlotte Kohl and Bowling Green graduate transfer Caterrion Thompson in this year’s class — keeping recent international and graduate transfer market pipelines developed under Schaefer alive.

Entering the 2020 season, MSU will boast 12 players from 11 different states and two countries. And while that geographic diversity was developed under Schaefer, it stands to continue under McCray-Penson.

“He (succeeded) without having top recruits which sometimes is very hard,” McCray-Penson said. “But for me and my staff, we’ve just got to continue to build on the tradition and build on the legacy and bring the right players in here that fit our culture and fit Mississippi State’s mission statement.”","STARKVILLE — When Nikki McCray-Penson took over for former Mississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer in late April, a foundation for success had been set.

WASHINGTON — Rep. Bennie Thompson and other Democrats are urging the national party to invest more resources in the South, including Mike Espy’s bid for a Senate seat in Mississippi.

“He’s got a shot. Things need to fall into place,” said Thompson, the lone Democrat in Mississippi's congressional delegation. “He’s setting the building blocks … We just need to make sure at the end of the day we put our best foot forward. A lot of people are committed to doing all they can to help him.”

Espy, a former Democratic congressman and secretary of agriculture under the Clinton administration, is running in a special election to replace Republican Thad Cochran. Cochran retired in April citing health reasons.

Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who in April was sworn in to fill Cochran’s unexpired term, and state Republican Sen. Chris McDaniel are among the other top contenders.

Thompson and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, mostly Democrats, have been meeting with officials from the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee to ramp up efforts to win House races, including some in the South.

“The South as a whole is fertile ground for Democratic political growth,"" he said.

Thompson said he hopes the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which supports Democratic Senate candidates, will include the Mississippi race.

He said Espy has to make the case to the DSCC. “If I get asked, I’ll tell them they should,” Thompson said.

The DSCC has not said what role, if any, it will play in the Mississippi race.

National parties often watch to see if candidates have money, a structure and local support.

""Espy is a strong candidate and we are closely monitoring the race,'' said a DSCC aide.

Recent polls show Espy and Hyde-Smith running neck and neck in the race. One recent poll sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which supports Hyde-Smith, showed her ahead. McDaniel, a tea party favorite who lost to Cochran in 2014, has questioned the accuracy of the polls.

Political experts say Democrats have enough challenges this year. The DSCC is defending 10 Senate incumbents in states that President Trump won.

Trump also won Mississippi.

Still, some Democrats, including Thompson, point to the Senate race in neighboring Alabama where Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore last December in the red state. It was the first time in 25 years a Democrat won a Senate seat in Alabama.

African-American voters, who traditionally support Democratic candidates, are credited with helping Jones pull off the upset. Blacks are about 37 percent of Mississippi's population.

“The blueprint for what needs to happen can use Alabama as a takeoff,"" Thompson said.

Jones said he’s excited about the prospects of Democrats focusing more on the South. He said it’s important for Democratic candidates to talk about “kitchen table"" issues, including health care, jobs and education.

“Those are winning issues for Democrats,” he said.

Thompson said the DCCC, the DSCC and the Democratic National Committee need to come early and often to the South and not take minority voters there for granted.

“If we are the base voters for the Democrat Party, then you need to invest equally in those voters,"" he said. “We should not be (the focus) two weeks before the election. We should be (the focus) two years before the election.""

Jones said while he appreciated help from national Democrats, he relied on grassroots groups, mapped out his own strategy and focused on local issues.

“It is very, very important for local candidates in the South to be able to run the race that they need ... that they are true to themselves and true to what I think the Democratic Party stands for,” he said.

Winner—“AIM for CHangE,” or Advancing, Inspiring, Motivating for Community Health through Extension, submitted by Masey Smith, project manager for the Department of Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion, and Associate Professor David Buys. FSNHP students, faculty and staff partnered with local medical facilities and food networks to reduce and prevent obesity in Mississippi through promotion of healthy nutrition standards, physical activity, food service guidelines and active living. The project led to the development of a food pantry in the state’s most food-insecure area, Holmes County, where more than 269,800 pounds of food have been distributed to 13,490 households since May 2020.

Honorable Mention—“Economic Planning and Analysis for Mississippi Communities,” submitted by MSU Extension Professor of Agricultural Economics Alan Barefield. This project allowed undergraduate students, guided by MSU Extension faculty, to provide analyses of individual issues for stakeholders in Mississippi. With assistance from the Mississippi Development Authority, elected officials and other community leaders, the project aimed to provide unbiased, research-based analyses using appropriate methodologies to communities; presented MSU as an unbiased, research-based source to assist communities in addressing current issues; and provided undergraduate students with exposure to research and outreach methodologies and issues, while also giving students the experience to interact with community leaders.

Since Linhoss began teaching ABE 4383 Building Construction in 2015, the course has collaborated with Starkville’s Habitat for Humanity. In the past, students in the course volunteered to gain hands-on experience in building construction working alongside a community partner. This fall, the course became designated in community-engaged learning and available to more than 200 students campuswide. Students continue volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, but now are developing content for a “How Your House Works” booklet for new homeowners and introducing them to tips on maintenance and more. Students also created a calendar with monthly home maintenance reminders.

Honorable Mention—“ECE Toy Adaptation Program,” submitted by MSU Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Jean Mohammadi-Aragh. Partnering with MSU’s T.K. Martin Center for Technology and Disability, the project provides hands-on, community-focused learning opportunities through modification of electronic toys. ECE students, faculty and staff create interactive toys that enable children with developmental disabilities to learn concepts such as letters and numbers and gain fundamental experiences such as cause-and-effect from pushing a modified button or switch to operate a toy. These toys help develop motor skills, communication skills and independence in children. The electronically modified toys are donated to the T.K. Martin Center and are used in therapy sessions by speech pathologists and occupational therapists, as well as given to some families during home visits.

Winner—“The Living Room Learning Garden,” submitted by Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture Cory Gallo. Teaming with Fertile Ground of Jackson, the project aimed to develop a learning garden for Galloway Elementary School in Jackson. At Galloway, MSU students and faculty worked alongside a coalition of community members, partners, school administrators, educators and experts to develop the garden. The team met monthly to conduct workshops with school children to help engage them with the garden’s design. Faculty also worked with MSU’s Office of Research and Economic Development and Starkville Oktibbeha School District to create a new learning garden for the district’s Partnership School. This garden is currently under development with plans to open this year.

Honorable Mention—“The Emmett Till Memorial: CE Studio,” submitted by Assistant Professor of Architecture Silvina Lopez Barrera. MSU students and faculty partnered with the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, which works to tell the story of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, and explores ways to facilitate racial healing. The project goal was to design a memorial in honor of Till at the Graball Landing site at the Tallahatchie River’s confluence with the Black Bayou where Till’s body was found. The commission has attempted to commemorate the nationally recognized site since 2008, but it has been repeatedly vandalized. During the project, the class visited sites related to Till’s history and engaged discussion with students and community members regarding how the project’s design will contribute to future site development. Nearly 40 student design proposals were shown at the Emmett Till Interpretative Center in Sumner.

Winner—“Any Given Child Meridian,” submitted by Assistant Professor Jeffrey Leffler, who also serves as interim graduate coordinator of MSU-Meridian’s Division of Education. The project began in 2016 when Meridian was chosen by the national John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to locally begin Any Given Child, a Pre-K through 8th grade arts integration partnership. The project strived to ensure equity of access to the arts for any child in the city. MSU students, faculty and staff aimed to complete five goals: expand and sustain arts education for all students; ensure active parental and community understanding and support of arts education for all students; sequentially build integration of the arts through professional development of school personnel, artists and arts organizations; create a funding model and organizational structure to sustain arts education in the Meridian Public School District; and continually assess Any Given Child implementation and impacts through collaborative data analysis.

Honorable Mention—“Low Impact Development Gulf Coast: Sustainable Stormwater Management” submitted by Tracy Wyman, a landscape architect with MSU’s Gulf Coast Community Design Center. An outreach and education initiative under the research arm of the College of Architecture, Art and Design, this project responded to the connection between upland management strategies and downstream impacts on low-lying areas and natural waterbodies. LID managed stormwater near the source and designed a series of treatment options that slow the flow of stormwater so it can better infiltrate the soil. MSU students, faculty and staff members worked to prevent pollutants from entering natural water bodies while building healthy soils and creating a pleasing aesthetic. The project engaged local planning and design professionals across the three coastal counties in the Gulf Coast region, engaged high school students in a hands-on education program, and exposed students to a variety of career choices in science, technology, engineering and math.

36,"Oct 24, 2020",Essence,Mississippi Health Official: Maskless White People Are Responsible For Spike In COVID-19 Cases,"Maskless white people in Mississippi are responsible for the spike in COVID-19 cases, according to Dr. Thomas Dobbs, a State Health Officer.

“We’ve seen a pretty remarkable shift because early on, African Americans accounted for basically two-thirds, or 60 percent or more, of cases and deaths,” Dobbs said on CNN. “Then over the summer, and especially going into the fall, we’ve seen that shift basically upside down. Sixty-percent of new cases are caucasians and the deaths are nearing that also.”

Dobbs said that the state has been been working hard on safety measures, which have found “more fertile ground in the Black community.”

“As far as the case trends, we have had really pretty good uptake by a lot of folks in the Black community with masking and social distancing,” Dobbs said. “We’ve worked very aggressively to make sure that the Black community understands where the risks are and what can be done to prevent that. “And I just will say … I think big parts of the white community, especially in areas that maybe weren’t as hard-affected (previously), have not been as compliant or engaged actively with social distancing and masking. And I think that does make a difference.”

According to Dobbs, there are white parents sponsoring youth events, dances, and parties. Additionally, get togethers and gathering in bars have helped to undermine the state’s efforts to control the spread of COVID-19.

As of Friday, October 23, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported 1,212 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths, bringing the state’s totals to 115,088 cases and 3,255 deaths, WDAM reports.

As white people continue to disproportionately endanger themselves and their neighbors, Black people continue to be most at risk from serious COVID-19 complications.

Mississippi is among the southern states that have opted not to expand Medicaid, but whose governors rushed to reopen businesses even though no vaccine or herd immunity had been established, ESSENCE previously reported.

“We—who were already neglected by states who chose profit and partisan politics over the health and well-being of our communities, who are disproportionately impacted by poverty, white supremacist violence, health disparities and more—are seeing less access to emergency care, while the few facilities that remain are becoming the primary source of care for our people,” Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, Executive Director of the Highlander Research & Education Center, wrote in March. “We’re seeing health care providers leave communities because of the closure of rural hospitals, gaps in specialty care expanding, job loss, and so much more, as the need for services increases beyond our ability to provide them.”

Those facts have not changed.

CNN

Less than one month after Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves irresponsibly ended the state’s mask mandate on September 30, he has reinstated the mandate for nine counties, WJTV reports.

Still, the Republican governor continues to politicize his COVID-19 response and sharing misleading information about the health of the state he claims to lead, tweeting Friday, “17% decrease in Mississippi COVID cases this week compared to last week. Even as cases surge in most states. Keep up the good work! We can do this without going crazy on government interventions—people get it! Virtue signaling is useless, but limited action in key areas works!”

According to CNN, President Donald Trump, who is known to be anti-science, including in his COVID-19 response, won Mississippi in 2016’s election by 17.8 percentage points.

Perhaps, the maskless white people endangering their own lives and others are following their president’s lead. Trump, who held a super-spreader event at the White House while not wearing a mask, called his own COVID-19 diagnosis a “blessing from God.”

Bloomberg. Anchorage, Alaska, and Coral Springs, Florida, were also named as grant winners earlier this month.

The funds will support the project “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access,” which aims to inform policy related to nutrition by using art as a medium to communicate the complexities of the issue in the city. Local and national artists, landscape architects, filmmakers, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, and community members will be invited to collaborate on a citywide exhibition featuring installations and performances, as well as other programming.

The initiative will activate public streets, community gardens, a local elementary school, and a vacant building, which will be converted into exhibition space and a food lab with a pop-up kitchen, to address challenges stemming from the proliferation of fast food restaurants in the area. According to the Clarion-Ledger, many areas of Jackson are considered food swamps where there is almost no access to grocery stores. Due to the overabundance of fast food, the city has the second highest obesity rate in the nation and the highest rate for children between the ages of ten and seventeen.

“The city is overjoyed to have been selected in this process,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement. “This was a highly competitive grant where over two hundred cities around the world applied to be a part of this Public Art Challenge. And so, to be able to aid in the aesthetic appeal of the city while delivering a message of healthy eating for the citizens of Jackson is a truly remarkable opportunity and we are ecstatic and look forward to seeing this project come into fruition.”

Among those participating in the project are artists Adrienne Domnick and Kara Walker; filmmakers Keegan Kuhn and Roderick Red; Mark Bittman, the country’s first food-focused op-ed columnist for the New York Times and a faculty member of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health; chef Nick Wallace; clean eating advocate Ron Finley; and landscape architect Walter Hood.

39,"Apr 18, 2018",Vox,Democrats have a legitimate shot to win the Mississippi Senate race,"This year’s unlikeliest competitive Senate race might be Mississippi.

There, in the Deep South, 80-year-old Republican Sen. Thad Cochran retired after four decades in the Senate. He was replaced by a new senator, Cindy Hyde-Smith, appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant, who had been in close contact with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as it became clear that Cochran’s health would not allow him to serve much longer. Cochran’s seat will now be on the ballot in November — and hard-right conservatives have had their eye on Mississippi for months.

Could it be Alabama all over again?

Conservative insurgent Chris McDaniel, a former state senator with ties to the neo-Confederate movement, was prepared to primary Mississippi’s other Republican senator at Steve Bannon’s urging. But now he’s running for Cochran’s open seat.

McDaniel already challenged Cochran in a bitterly contested 2014 Republican primary — it involved a break-in and a suicide — and to this day, his supporters contend that election was stolen from him in part because many of the black voters in the state lined up behind Cochran.

But even if Hyde-Smith prevails over McDaniel among Republicans, as recent polls suggest she would, Democrats could still make the race competitive. A new poll conducted for Y’all Politics, a well-read conservative news site in the state, showed McDaniel significantly behind Hyde-Smith — and found Hyde-Smith leading the top Democrat in the race, former congressman Mike Espy, by just six points.

“Mississippi is a red state, but I think most people would be surprised to learn that [John] McCain only won the state by 13 points and [Mitt] Romney by 12. It is actually substantially less red than Alabama,” Sean Trende, an elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, told me in an email. When you add it all up, Mississippi is a “lighter load than Alabama.”

Then you have the Trump factor. For now, the president has refused to back Bryant’s choice for the Cochran seat. Mississippi’s Senate race should be a familiar drama — the establishment versus the far-right wing, McConnell versus Bannon, with a credible Democrat waiting to run against whoever makes it out alive.

Chris McDaniel versus the Republican establishment, explained

First things first: The Mississippi race will be a jungle primary. That means every candidate runs in the first race on Election Day in November. If one candidate gets 50 percent of the total vote, they win. But if they don’t — and it seems unlikely, with a strong Democratic candidate and a fractured GOP field — the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election that same month. (One of them could be the Democrat Espy — whom we’ll get to in a bit.)

McDaniel was originally going to challenge Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, a favorite target of alt-right mastermind and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. McDaniel had discussed his Wicker challenge with Bannon before announcing, Mississippi Today reported last fall, and his potential candidacy had received favorable coverage from Breitbart, Bannon’s former employer. But McDaniel switched over to the open Cochran race after the senator said he would step down in April.

It probably doesn’t make much difference to Bannon, who clearly sees Mississippi as fertile ground for the alt-right populist revolution he is still trying to get off the ground.

“Mitch McConnell is a literal anchor tied to the hips of folks like Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran,” Andy Surabian, a Bannon adviser, told NBC News last fall. “We expect the anti-establishment wave we are seeing across the country today to hit Mississippi like a tsunami in 2018 and beyond.”

Bryant’s pick to replace Cochran on April 1 was Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state’s agriculture commissioner. She is Mississippi’s first woman senator.

McDaniel had once upon a time lobbied Bryant to name him as Cochran’s replacement, the Washington Post reported, but the governor was not interested.

There is a lot of bad blood between McDaniel and the Republican establishment, left over from the 2014 primary. Bryant even took a swing at McDaniel after the state senator announced he would switch from the Wicker to the Cochran race.

“This opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,” Bryant told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger.

The newspaper reported that Bryant was looking for a candidate who was particularly well suited to beating McDaniel. The governor settled on Hyde-Smith, but the White House and Washington Republicans weren’t exactly on board with that choice. Politico reported that Trump won’t campaign for or endorse Hyde-Smith because the White House is worried her history as a Democrat (she switched parties in 2010) could make her vulnerable. McDaniel, right on cue, has already begun attacking Hyde-Smith for her past in the other party.

The most recent polling suggests Hyde-Smith is building a substantial advantage over McDaniel, though. The Clarion Ledger reported this week that Espy and Hyde-Smith were pulling away from the rest of the field based on the Y’all Politics survey of the race:

Democrat Mike Espy: 33.1 percent

Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith: 33 percent

Republican Chris McDaniel: 12.8 percent

Democrat Jason Shelton: 6.2 percent

(Another recent poll, commissioned by Espy’s campaign, found the Democrat and Hyde-Smith as the top two candidates, though McDaniel had a stronger showing at 21 percent.)

The establishment is hellbent on stopping McDaniel and they might be succeeding. Which brings us back to 2014.

Let’s remember how absolutely surreal the 2014 campaign was

McDaniel has to be taken seriously because he mounted a very credible challenge against Cochran in 2014. Let’s start with the math: In the first round of the GOP’s jungle primary that year, McDaniel actually got more votes (49.5 percent) than Cochran (49 percent); a man named Thomas Carey got the remaining votes. But McDaniel did not get the needed 50 percent, so he and Cochran had a rematch.

In that showdown, Cochran narrowly prevailed over McDaniel, 51 percent to 49 percent, but not without a lot of bitterness and allegations of wrongdoing on both sides.

But those are the vote totals. That’s not the memorable part. In brief — and to understand why Bryant and other establishment Republicans are so hell-bent on beating McDaniel this year — here is your unofficial rundown of the 2014 Mississippi primary, courtesy of Talking Points Memo:

A 26-year-old blogger and McDaniel supporter nicknamed “Constitutional Clayton” broke into the nursing home where Cochran’s wife resides and took pictures of her for an attack ad accusing the senator of infidelity with one of his aides.

That blogger later went to jail for the break-in conspiracy. On a more tragic note, one of his alleged conspirators killed himself during the investigation.

Chuck Johnson, the infamous conservative raconteur, accused the Cochran campaign of bribing black voters to support the senator.

Johnson was later investigated by the Mississippi attorney general for his report and allegations that he actually bribed a source of the accusations he made against Cochran.

But after the election, the McDaniel campaign did file a lawsuit accusing the Cochran camp of soliciting Democratic votes, which they said would invalidate the results. The suit was eventually rejected by the state Supreme Court.

In other words, the McDaniel campaign tried to use the specter of black voters to delegitimize an election result — a problematic tactic, to say the least, given the state senator’s history of racially charged remarks.

The 2014 race is still a sore point for everybody involved. Just this year, McDaniel said:

“What I have is a situation in which I’m running for the same seat I ran for in 2014 — the seat we felt we won in 2014. Now God had other plans for that, obviously, and that’s okay and we accept that. All I’m asking for now is to be allowed to finish that term that we ran for in 2014.”

And that explains equally well, on the establishment side of the equation, why Bryant and other Republican leaders are so intent on defeating McDaniel again. McDaniel and his supporters had maligned Cochran, a titan of Mississippi Republican politics, and deployed dirtier-than-dirty tactics to try to unseat him.

The hypothetical path for another Democratic win in the Deep South

All of this leads to a pretty serious opening for Democrats. So who is the Democrat in this race?

Former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy — who comes with some of his own baggage after being acquitted of bribery charges in the 1990s — has already announced that he will run for Cochran’s seat with the backing of Democrats in the state. The 64-year-old represented the Jackson area in Congress for six years before serving as President Bill Clinton’s secretary of agriculture from 1993 to 1994.

But he was forced to step down amid an ethics investigation. Allegations were made that he improperly received airplane and sports tickets. Espy was eventually acquitted on all charges, but it more or less ended his career in politics; he has been out of public office for nearly 25 years, spending the past decade as a private attorney.

Espy looks likely to lock up one of the spots for the runoff election. That means the initial vote will function as a quasi-Republican primary: The top two GOP candidates will be vying to come in first or second and earn the right to face Espy. And with Democratic turnout up all around the country, that could put Espy on the map in a real way.

“I think against a more traditional Southern Republican, you get maybe something that looks like the presidential numbers, tightened a bit for turnout,” Trende told me.

To his point: for now, according to the Y’all Politics poll, Hyde-Smith is leading with 42 percent of the vote to Espy’s 36 percent.

If Hyde-Smith holds onto her lead over McDaniel, she has to be considered the favorite against Espy in the runoff. Maybe things will be a little closer than usual. It could get even more competitive if Espy runs a strong campaign or if the national environment becomes even worse for Republicans.

If McDaniel were to win and face Espy in a one-on-one runoff, things start to get really interesting. The poll cited by the Clarion Ledger found the Democrat with a 43 percent to 24 percent lead over McDaniel.

Espy certainly starts with some challenges: He could have lost his skills in retail politics, he might not be adept at fundraising, etc. But if he shows up in game shape, he could have some real advantages in Mississippi against McDaniel.

The conservative candidate has a troubling list of, shall we say, racially charged rhetoric and affiliating with more openly racist people:

He spoke at a neo-Confederate conference in 2013.

He recently appeared on a radio show with a host who traffics in anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracies.

He has blamed “hip-hop” for gun violence, saying that it is “morally bankrupt” and destroys community values,

TPM had a long rundown in 2014 of McDaniel’s various remarks about reparations and “mamacitas.”

With some solid fundraising and spending, Espy could turn out more black voters — already about one-third of the state’s electorate — and he could then bring the race down to single digits, Trende told me.

“At that point, you’re really not talking about convincing that many whites to either state home or vote Democrat because of McDaniel’s racialized statements,” he said.

Espy, it should be noted, said kind words about Cochran as he announced his candidacy, and the Clarion-Ledger wrote that Espy has long been considered the model for the kind of black candidate who could win crossover white voters in Mississippi.

40,"Dec 2, 2019",History,Ancient Native Americans Once Thrived in Bustling Urban Centers,"Long before the arrival of European explorers, soldiers and settlers in North America, the portion of the continent north of Mexico was inhabited by as many as 18 million native people. And contrary to the popular perception of American Indians living a nomadic existence, many of the continent’s aboriginal inhabitants lived in thriving urban centers.

One settlement, Cahokia in modern-day Illinois, had a population of 20,000 at its peak around 1100-1150 A.D. Around that same period in time, New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon was the center of a sophisticated culture that erected what were the most massive buildings on the continent, until the rise of skyscrapers built from steel girders in the late 1800s.

Those urban centers were part of what historians Lisa Krissoff Boehm and Steven Hunt Corey have described as “a landscape rich with its own history—a land shaped by diverse peoples living in varying patterns of settlement.”

Cahokia Sprawled Over Five Square Miles

8 Gallery 8 Images

Like cities in other parts of the world, Cahokia, which sprawled over an area of about five square miles, developed in a highly desirable spot. The settlement was situated along a flood plain that provided fertile soil for agriculture, with nearby hickory forests to provide wood and other raw materials as well as wildlife to hunt, according to Lori Belknap, site manager for the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site.

Cahokia also had convenient access to the nearby Mississippi River, which its residents—a people known as the Mississippian culture—navigated in large dugout canoes. “It likely was a trading center,” Belknap says.

Like a modern city with suburbs, Cahokia’s outer edge was a residential area, consisting of houses made from sapling frames lined with clay walls and covered by prairie grass roofs. Further inside was a log palisade wall and guard towers, which protected a central ceremonial precinct of the site, including Monks Mound, the Grand Plaza and 17 other mounds. More than 100 mounds extended more than a mile outside the wall in all directions. Some served as bases for what probably were important community buildings, while other cone-shaped mounds functioned as burial sites. Still others apparently were markers that delineated the city’s boundaries, according to Belknap.

At the center was the 100-foot-tall Monks Mound, the largest earthen mound in North America, which had four terraces and a ramp or stairway leading up from the ground. From the top of the mound, one could take in a panoramic view of Cahokia and its surrounding realm.

One of the most remarkable things about Cahokia is that it appears to have been carefully planned around 1000 A.D., with a rectangular-shaped Grand Plaza whose core design mirrors the native vision of the cosmos, according to archaeologist Thomas Emerson. From the beginning, the city’s builders had “grandiose visions of what Cahokia would be,” Emerson explains. “It did not grow by slow accretion through time.”

The events that led to the deliberate building of Cahokia and the rapid growth of its population remain unclear. “A religious prophet? The immigration of a foreign elite group? The introduction of maize?” Emerson says. “The options seem endless, but we have few answers right now.”

Cahokia’s decline, which began around 1250 or 1300, and culminated in the site’s abandonment by 1350, are similarly mysterious. A recent study suggests the settlement’s demise was linked to climate change since a decrease in rainfall would have affected the Mississippians’ ability to grow their staple crop of maize. Others think that the sheer size and diversity of the Cahokian population may have led to irreconcilable rifts.

“It was a large population, composed of immigrants from the midcontinent who brought very different practices and beliefs to the city,” Emerson says. “The management of differences requires a strong social and political consensus within a group. If that consensus collapses, societies will fragment into their smaller groups that existed based on kinship, ethnicity, religious beliefs, residential propinquity, shared economic goals, etc.”

In New Mexico, the Chaco Canyon settlement flourished between 850 and 1250 A.D. Over the years, researchers have come up with wildly varying estimates of the center’s peak population, from around 2,000 to as many as 25,000, according to a 2005 National Park Service report.

Chaco Canyon appears to have been the ceremonial, trade and administrative hub of a network of neighboring communities, some as far as 60 miles away. A 2016 study by University of Colorado Boulder researcher Larry Benson found that Chaco Canyon’s salty soil wasn’t good for growing corn and beans, so the settlement had to import food and other resources from those places. Those communities were connected by an extensive network of roads and an irrigation system, according to Boehm and Corey.

Builders in Chaco Canyon developed sophisticated stone masonry construction techniques that allowed them to erect 150 multi-story structures, some as tall as five to six stories in height, with hundreds of rooms. In addition to stone, the builders used about 240,000 trees, some harvested from the Chuska Mountains about 50 miles to the west, according to a 2015 study by University of Arizona scientists.

The great houses, as these massive structures were called, probably weren’t dwellings, but rather public buildings used when people of the region gathered for ceremonies or to engage in commerce, according to NPS.

“Elite chiefs constructed the great houses to demonstrate their authority,” Benson, an adjoint curator of anthropology at the University of Colorado Boulder’s Museum of Natural History, says. “However, they did not live in the canyon. Instead, they lived in wetter more productive regions at the periphery of the San Juan Basin where they oversaw the production of foodstuffs and the harvesting of mammals.”

In 2017, DNA analysis of remains suggested that the settlement may have been founded and ruled over a period of more than 300 years by dynastic elite that controlled the ritual practices at Pueblo Bonito, the 600-room structure that was the settlement’s most important building.

Like Cahokia, the Chaco Canyon settlement was abandoned eventually. Some have suggested that people in the area cut down too much of the forests, leading to erosion and destruction of farming. But a 2014 study by University of New Mexico researchers concluded that there wasn’t evidence to support that scenario.","And contrary to the popular perception of American Indians living a nomadic existence, many of the continent’s aboriginal inhabitants lived in thriving urban centers.

41,"Jul 23, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,How Mississippi State is tapping into Florida in the 2021 and 2022 classes,"STARKVILLE — Mississippi State has garnered a Sunshine state of mind on the recruiting trail in recent months.

Less than a week after the Bulldogs earned a pledge from three-star linebacker Timar Rogers, MSU now has two players from Florida amongst its 11 commitments in the class of 2021. And while Florida boasts a fertile recruiting ground, it’s a state staffers in Starkville have had little success recruiting until recently.

Under Joe Moorhead’s tenure at MSU, the Bulldogs never signed more than a single recruit from Florida in either of the 2018 or 2019 classes. The 2020 class, which was largely compiled by Moorhead’s staff, boasted one Florida native in three-star defensive end Jamari Stewart, but he was added after Leach took over.

Before Moorhead, Dan Mullen had comparable success in the Sunshine State. Mullen never enrolled more than one Florida player in any of his first seven classes — including three years in which none were signed. Following the string of success MSU enjoyed between 2014 and 2015, the Bulldogs did bring in five players from Florida between the 2016 and 2017 classes, but that momentum came to a lull after Mullen, ironically, took the head coaching job at Florida.

As for Leach, he signed 11 players from Florida between the 2014 and 2019 classes during his time at Washington State compared to Mullen’s eight.

“Get the best ones closest that you can and then extend it out as you have to, but don’t ignore real quality guys who are really interested in your program,” Leach said of his recruiting philosophy in February. “Sometimes a relative went there, sometimes a guy is just curious, sometimes someone really likes a major there, that type of thing, but no matter where they’re at, if they’re really interested in you, I don’t think you’d ignore them.”

Part of the explanation for MSU’s recent dip into Florida is the connections on the new coaching staff. Early in his career, Leach recruited the state while an assistant for Hal Mumme at Iowa Wesleyan and later Valdosta State, a Division II school less than a half-hour drive from the Florida border in southern Georgia.

Outside receivers coach Steve Spurrier Jr. also spent time as a graduate assistant in Gainesville during the mid-1990s and recruited the state while an assistant for his father and longtime Florida coach Steve Spurrier at South Carolina.

“Georgia can’t take everybody in Georgia and Texas, and Texas A&M can’t take all the good players in Texas,” 247sports Director of Recruiting Steve Wiltfong told The Dispatch in April. “There’s so many good players, and if you evaluate well you can really become a good football team recruiting those three states (Georgia, Texas and Florida).”

Boasting a breadth of connections to Florida, MSU’s 2021 and 2022 class could have a certain flare for the state. Rogers and high school teammate Myzell Williams out of Deland are already on board amongst the 2021s. MSU has also offered 39 Florida prospects in the 2021 class and another 14 in the class of 2022. By contrast the Bulldogs have offered 21 players from Mississippi in the 2021 class and 10 in 2022.

As for actual prospects who could add to MSU’s impending classes, the Bulldogs have been heavily involved with 2022 safety Jaydon Hodge out of Forest High School in Ocala. MSU is also in the running for 2021 offensive guard Kimo Makaneole.

This isn’t to say MSU is simply going to abandon recruiting Mississippi and that the Bulldogs will suddenly have an influx of classes comprised exclusively of Florida products. Rather, Leach noted that he and his staff’s past stops would allow MSU to recruit more nationally and thus far, that’s come to fruition.

“The good news is there’s talent everywhere,” MSU safeties coach and former Texas recruiting coordinator Jason Washington told The Dispatch in February. “And these kids are getting out and going different places, and so when they step on campus, we want to make this feel like home for them and gain a relationship and a love for our coaches and the players that are around here and the city of Starkville. From there, shoot, sell everything else and give them a goal and a light at the end of the tunnel.”","STARKVILLE — Mississippi State has garnered a Sunshine state of mind on the recruiting trail in recent months.

Renovations to Mississippi Coliseum Completed

Mississippi Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner Andy Gipson announced in August that work had finished five months ahead of schedule on renovations to the Mississippi Coliseum at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds, partially due to event cancellations from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Wier Boerner Allin Architecture designed the $2.2-million renovation project, which began in October 2019 and was originally planned to finish by January 2021. Renovations included repairing and painting floors and walls with abrasive, slip-resistant paint, installing new seating, and adding handrails and reflectors.

The Mississippi Coliseum is attached to the new Mississippi Trade Mart building. The state Legislature consolidated the Mississippi Fair Commission into the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce effective July 1, 2020.

Sunshine for All Program

The fruit-supplying company Dole launched its ""Sunshine for All"" program in Jackson in August. The program aims to provide better nutrition for 1 billion people in underserved communities by 2025.

As part of the program, Dole will partner with Jackson-based food organization Up in Farms to support their farm-to-table training center. Dole will also distribute fresh produce and smoothies to areas in Jackson that are considered food deserts, meaning they lack easy access to grocery stores and healthy foods.

The Sharing the Sunshine Meals & Nutrition Education Program will provide educational courses for children and families on healthy cooking and affordable shopping for healthy food, as well as cooking classes for adults. Dole will also host a Kids Cooking Camp to provide hands-on lessons in basic food preparation for children.

Dole will also host pop-up farmers markets and provide healthy meals on alternating weekends at Boys and Girls Club locations in Jackson.

Local organizations participating in the Sunshine for All program include the Fertile Ground Project, the Jackson Public Schools Administration and the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

JXN Icons Mural

Visit Jackson officially unveiled the ""JXN Icons"" mural at the Old Capitol Inn (226 N. State St.) in July.

Groundbreaking for Museum to Market Trail

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and other officials hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Museum to Market multi-use path in July.

In 2011, the City of Jackson received a $1.1-million federal grant through the Mississippi Department of Transportation and the Central Mississippi Planning and Development District to construct the planned walking, running and biking trail.

The Museum to Market Trail will include construction of 2.14 miles of new multi-use path or replacement sidewalk from the Mississippi Farmers Market on High Street to the Mississippi Children's Museum on Highland Drive.

The $1,579,850 project also includes a new pedestrian bridge over a creek and the conversion of an abandoned railway into a compliant 10-foot-wide multi-use path from Spengler Street to Laurel Street.

The Federal Highway Administration and the Mississippi Department of Transportation funded the project. Residents can follow the progress of the project on the museum trail's Facebook page.

Road Repair and Repaving

Thirteen Jackson streets are on a repaving list for 2020, Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba announced in July, as part of an effort to reverse the degrading of road infrastructure in the City. The streets include Canton Mart Road, Old Canton Road, Northside Drive, Pear Orchard Road, Lakeland Drive, N. Gallatin Street, Jefferson Street, Bailey Avenue, Ellis Avenue, Belvedere Drive, McDowell Road and Oak Forest Drive.

The One Percent Sales Tax Commission, which administers a 1% sales tax increase Jackson voters approved in 2014, is funding the repaving, which will cost $5.3 million.

Mayor Lumumba's administration has, in the last three years, poured $15 million into ""south Jackson alone"" to repair bridges and repave roads, he said.

Russell C. Davis Planetarium Renovations Ahead

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced renovations to the Russell C. Davis Planetarium in July.

A roof leak and the resulting interior damage forced the planetarium to close in April 2018. With the damage repaired, the City is preparing to renovate the building for the first time in 40 years and plans to reopen the planetarium by April 2022.

The planetarium ran a fundraising campaign and sold limited-edition merchandise to raise money for design work, exhibition design and build-out.

Andrew Jackson Statue at City Hall Being Replaced

In August, the Jackson City Council authorized Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to legally remove and relocate the statue of former President Andrew Jackson from City Hall.

Mayor Lumumba said he supports the move and wants a newly commissioned statue of Medgar Evers as the replacement. Evers, a civil-rights hero, lived in Jackson before his assassination in 1963. Jackson, on the other hand, was a white supremacist who led the removal of Native Americans from their lands.

The resolution passed 5-1, with Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote as the lone opposition and Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps absent.

UMMC Hospital Visitation Restricted to Curb COVID-19 Spread

Effective Monday at noon, the University of Mississippi Medical Center will restrict visitors at its Jackson-based hospitals in an effort to lessen the spread of the novel coronavirus and help ensure the safety of patients, visitors, employees and students.

As of Saturday, the Mississippi State Department of Health had announced six presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Mississippi cases currently cover the counties of Forrest, Leflore, Copiah and Pearl River. It is generally accepted that Mississippi is experiencing community spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus

Medical Center leadership is enacting a revised visitor policy for all UMMC hospitals. The primary restrictions being put in place are:

Adult patients are not permitted to have visitors except in certain circumstances according to hospital visitation policies.

Pediatric patients (Children’s of Mississippi) are permitted to have only two adult visitors, but both must be parents, guardians or caregivers.

Temporary visitor restrictions are already in effect for UMMC Grenada and UMMC Holmes County. The Jackson hospitals are University Hospital, Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants, Batson Children’s Hospital and Conerly Critical Care Hospital.

Also, beginning Monday, there will be only two entrances for patients and visitors of the Jackson-based hospitals:

The front entrance of University Hospital (under the overhang facing State Street near Garage A)

The side entrance to Wiser Hospital for Women and Children (under the overhang facing Garage B)

Patients and visitors will be screened at those two entrances. Patients who exhibit symptoms associated with respiratory illness (fever, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath) or report they have recently visited an area identified as a location experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak will receive further evaluation to determine next steps. Visitors that meet any of these criteria will not be allowed to enter under any circumstances.

Along with the person doing the screening, also present at these two entrances will be a Campus Police officer and a patient experience representative. The entrances for University Heart, Adult and Pediatric EDs and the Pavilion will be open, but will not provide patients and visitors access to hospitals.

Restrictions and entry screenings also apply to patients and visitors needing to enter a hospital for a hospital-based clinic or procedure appointments.

Conversation: Heather McTeer Toney

Maureen Nandini Mitra Winter 2020

An upbeat, smart, powerhouse — that was my first impression of Heather McTeer Toney as I watched her onstage taking on a former Trump administration EPA official on the issue of climate change at the Society of Environmental Journalists’ conference in Fort Collins, Colorado this past October. It was easy to see why this native of Greenville, Mississippi was elected her town’s first African-American, first female, and youngest-ever mayor back in 2004 when she was only 27. And why, after two terms as mayor — during which she worked to improve Greenville’s water supply and infrastructure, and helped reduce the city’s debt — she was appointed administrator for the EPA’s Southeast Region by President Barack Obama.

A lawyer by training, McTeer Toney has received numerous awards and honors over the past two decades for her advocacy on multiple social issues including domestic violence, unfair labor practices, and environmental and climate justice. Currently she is the national field director for Moms Clean Air Force, an organization of over one million parents committed to fighting climate change and air pollution.

When I caught up with McTeer Toney over the phone a few weeks after the conference, our hour-long conversation reinforced my first impression. She is a powerhouse indeed. We talked about everything from fighting gender and racial stereotypes, to climate change as an election issue, to the importance of community and faith in the environmental movement. An excerpt.

What first got you interested in environmental issues?

That’s so hard to say. I’m from a part of the country where just naturally you’re involved with the environment just because it’s a very agrarian society. The Mississippi Delta is surrounded by the world’s most fertile soil and has a history of farming. [The environment] was a part of everything that we did — from people having gardens in their backyards, to picking pecans in the fall, and respecting the Mississippi River and how powerful it was.

The way that we talk about the environment in today’s words is not sufficient to describe my interaction, or people that I know from the South — people of color’s —interaction with environment. Because when you look up What is an environmentalist? if you just Google what it looks like, it’s very singular. It’s a lot of white people and hugging trees. That’s just not my idea and image of an environmentalist. For me it’s people who are connected to land and soil in ways that are both good and bad, and that’s been my connection and passion all my life.

So basically, what you are saying is that you grew up close to the soil and didn’t feel any separation between self and environment per se?

Right, even though my parents were middle-class professionals — my dad was an attorney, my mom a schoolteacher. I think that we’re all environmentalists in our own way, especially coming from the part of the country where I come from, where people’s entire livelihood, whether you are a farmer or not, is dependent upon how the environment is growing and thriving.

Maybe I should rephrase the question. What I was hoping to learn is when you started being concerned about the damage we are doing to our environment.

I think it was when I was in college and working as a legislative aide to Senator Dawnzella James in the Georgia state legislature and I was charged with going to some of her constituent meetings. You know, constituent meetings in East Point, Georgia dealt with a lot of different things and one of them was people concerned about environmental justice issues in the community, particularly landfills and [industrial waste] dumping. This was in the late ’90s. To see communities whose issues had to do with pollution that appeared to be intentional — and polluting was prevalent not just in this particular community, but throughout the country — I think that was one of the first places that really raised my awareness of issues like this.

When I came back home [to Greenville] and started practicing law and running for office, the issue that really catapulted me into environmental work was working on water issues in my community. Understanding Greenville’s brown water [caused by cypress roots in underground springs] and how it impacts our communities [the water was safe to drink but locals said its dirty color hampered economic development and the city couldn’t afford a filtration system to clear it up] — that really grew into understanding the economic and environmental disparities that impact the communities that look like mine.

Going through that process … opened the door to additional engagement because [then EPA Administrator] Lisa Jackson visited Greenville and asked me to work with her on the local government advisory committee. I was like, Oh my God. I’m so honored. And she said, Hold your horses, you don’t know what I just asked you to do. And she was absolutely right, because within two to three weeks of that the [April 2010] BP oil spill happened.

When I look at back at my development and trajectory into environmental work, it has always been community-based. The one thing that was similar in all of these experiences was the understanding of community and how the lens of environmental work was never seen through their eyes. I found that powerful because it was, in my opinion, the most important element that had been left out.

As a former EPA administrator, how hard do you think it’s going to be for the agency to bounce back post-Trump?

That is that is definitely a concern. The fact that there are 85 regulations that this administration has in some way tried to either reverse, or put a halt to, or weaken puts the pressure on the next administration not only to meet the climate requirements of the Paris Accord, but at the same time respond to 85 rollbacks.

‘[2020] candidates that are successful will be able to wrap climate into every single topic.’

On top of all that, there’s [the EPA itself] to shore up, because this administration has really tried to devastate the agency in terms of its workforce. It has reduced the number of scientists, and it has reduced the number of staff that are necessary to do congressionally required actions. This is actually cutting scientists and institutional knowledge that we need in this agency…. I am a woman of faith, so I’m praying for some grace and mercy for the next administration, but also that there are folks who are going to be able to come in and hit the ground running at full speed, just to catch up.

Moms Clean Air Force aims at nonpartisanship, right?

Correct. We are mom-partisan.

I’m curious about whether that can be challenging at times and what steps you recommend to help build consensus across the divide?

Yes, it is challenging at times. What we find is that it helps if we can keep people focused on our children. Like, forget all of the other noise that’s going on and how we feel about it, our reality is we have to focus on what’s the best thing for our kids. We try to find those places of commonality that allow us to bring people to the table around similar issues. For example, when it came to the [Trump administration’s proposed] rollback of the [federal] mercury and air toxic standards, which we really fought hard to get, we were able to connect with the evangelical community because they were very supportive of protecting unborn children. So there was some commonality there and we could come together with people who are traditionally thought to be very conservative.

Do you think climate change is going to be a key issue in the 2020 elections?

Yes, it is — for some good reasons and some not-so-good reasons. The not-so-good reasons are there will be more extreme weather and every time there is a devastation with extreme weather that we can connect to climate, it will be front and center. It may not be front and center for long, but it will be front and center … and it will impact people in one of their five physical senses or maybe all of them, and we’ll call for some action on climate. It’s happening in California now with the fires that have taken place. In Georgia, they just put out their Level 1 drought alert. So these are things that people feel, and anything that people feel they will vote on.

The other thing is, nobody a year ago could have said that our entire country would be moved by a 16-year-old-girl sailing across the ocean to do climate strikes, right? Yet here we are [with Greta Thunberg]. And we have an entire movement of young people that are showing up in places to talk about climate. So I think that it is definitely going to be a part of the conversation that people consider when they vote.

Now, the candidates that are successful will be able to wrap climate into every single topic. So if we’re going to talk about health and wellness in this country, part of that conversation will be about climate, part of their answer will be about the health impacts of climate. Education, part of that answer is going to be about how in the next 20 years our schools and education systems will certainly do good to focus on how to solve the climate crisis and increase our ability to create solutions. When it comes to the economy, it will help to have a conversation about the renewable energy sector being one of the number one growth sectors in this country and how this is a place where people can get jobs. These are the types of ideas that I think will resonate with people. They need that connector.

You mentioned that you’re a person of faith. How important has your faith been in the work that you do, especially given that the mainstream environmental movement has been largely agnostic.

Yeah, it goes back to that idea that you can’t believe in Jesus and the climate at the same time, which is crazy to me because the actual tenets of faith have to do with taking care of God’s creation. For me, and I’m speaking very personally, not for the organization, it is my responsibility as a Christian believer to take care of what God has blessed me with. And part of that is care for the Earth.

I think that we’ve done a disservice to the environmental movement in couching our Christianity as a dominion-ism, in terms of God has given us dominion over these things as opposed to, has charged us with taking care of this. And that’s a big difference between, I think, black and white [people] in terms of our Christianity and in our beliefs with respect to climate.

Creation care has a deeper meaning [for us] because this goes back to our enslavement ... The idea of salvation was an idea of freedom, which as an enslaved person was the thing that we clung to. But also the sense of responsibility, to care for things, to care for each other better. Which is a lot different than sort of the sin and damnation and everybody going to hell [idea of Christianity]… I connect to it very deeply. My ancestors came to this continent and struggled through so much. Part of their faith — I have ministers in my family line — was a belief that we are now free through Christ, but that we have an obligation to take care of what God has given us, to take care of other people, to free other people — not through our Bible-thumping but through how we live.

What, if anything, in your opinion is missing in the mainstream environmental movement? How can it better serve its mission?

I think we’re in this really cool space where we’re changing the conversation. We’re sort of all becoming translators and learning each other’s languages. We’ve been working in our own silos until now. A lot of the larger, more majority organizations have been trying for some time [to break down silos and be inclusive of marginalized communities], but are now recognizing they’ve got to shift their language. They are recognizing that it’s not always about just magnifying a voice in some of these communities; they just really need to give people the microphone and let them speak for themselves.

We’re beginning to now see that type of partnership and it’s because we’re on a timeline. We know we’ve got 10 to 11 years, as opposed to the 12 that the IPPC report initially told us, to reduce our carbon emissions, or we’re going to be in a place where we can have irreversible changes. We can shift some of that if we figure out how to talk to each other and work together.

But it means having some give and take. So, white organizations, or majority organizations, and majority donors who have not typically engaged or worked with some of the minority communities are now having to do that and they should. It means some of the minority organizations who have sort of turned their faces and said, Y’all didn’t want to mess with us and now you want to talk to us? have to say yes, they’re willing to come in and have these conversations. So it’s a healing process. But it’s also learning how to talk to one another to solve a problem.

46,"Sep 12, 2018",,"In North Carolina, co-ops are building a more democratic economy","Nestled at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina, Morganton may seem like an unlikely place to find a large Mayan community. But since the 1980s, the Burke County city of almost 17,000 people, over 75 percent of them white and 12 percent black, is home to a growing Latino community, including Mayan immigrants from Guatemala.

Like other immigrants before them, the Maya came to Morganton in search of economic opportunity. Many found work at the local Case Farms chicken processing plant but grew dissatisfied over low wages, poor working conditions, and unsuccessful labor organizing efforts.

Searching for a better way to make a living, some have found it in cooperative economics. In 2008, Morganton native Molly Hemstreet organized Opportunity Threads to fill the need for ethical labor opportunities for the local community and to produce textiles for companies across North Carolina. Today, 20 of the co-op's 26 employees are Mayans.

Every employee at Opportunity Threads is hired with the expectation of becoming a worker-owner who gets to vote to determine how profits are divided, how new members are recruited, and how the cooperative invests in the local community.

That democratic approach to work drives plant manager Walter Vicente, who came to North Carolina from Guatemala in 1999 at age 14, to recruit others into the cooperative system. He hopes to eventually see the number of Opportunity Thread's employees grow to upwards of 60.

""It's what I love to do — explaining to people that there are other ways to work, to be your own boss,"" Vicente told Facing South.

'On the right side'

Opportunity Threads is one of dozens of cooperative organizations in North Carolina and elsewhere across country seeking to fill the gaps created by increasing economic inequality.

Cooperatives have a rich history in the South and played an important role during the black freedom struggle in the 1950s and ‘60s. For example, the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer formed the Freedom Farm Cooperative in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1969 in an effort to empower poor black sharecroppers who had long been at the mercy of white landowners. The cooperative planted cash crops like cotton to pay administrative expenses as well as vegetables that were distributed to its members.

Last year the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund — an influential fund that has long supported agricultural co-ops across the South — celebrated its 50th anniversary. During a dinner to mark the occasion, Charles Prejean, the group's original executive director, noted that the federation ""survived because we are on the right side. We want families to succeed and have opportunity.""

Cooperatives are not limited to factories and farms: There are also cooperative grocery stores, credit unions, and more. The central principle they all have in common is a commitment to economic democracy — to worker-owned, -managed, and -governed workplaces. As a result, cooperatives have historically broken down barriers for the economically disadvantaged, often in communities of color.

African Americans have long taken part in cooperative economic activity as a way of surviving white oppression. ""We were using pooling mechanisms from the very beginning,"" political economist Jessica Gordon-Nembhard of the City University of New York and co-founder of the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives told Grassroots Economic Organizing in a 2014 interview. Those efforts eventually became formalized through churches, fraternal organizations, mutual aid societies, unions, and cooperatives.

""Most people want to work. Most people do work,"" said Gordon-Nembhard. ""With a co-op, people control what's happening to it, and what decisions get made economically; and then benefit proportionally. So we see how co-ops are a viable strategy exactly because of how they help groups of like-minded people in similar situations to collectively help themselves and each other.""

'Radically inclusive'

Not every cooperative has a focus on empowering poor communities, but those that do have a resource in the Greensboro, North Carolina-based Fund for Democratic Communities (F4DC). Founded by activists Marnie Thompson and Ed Whitfield in 2007, F4DC provides financial and technical assistance for grassroots and community-based economic development projects, including cooperatives.

For example, F4DC was an early supporter of the Renaissance Food Cooperative, which was organized in Greensboro in 2016 and now provides jobs and affordable grocery options in one of the most food insecure areas in the United States.

The Fund has also been supporting a new venture being organized in the historically African-American community of Southeast Raleigh. The Fertile Ground Food Cooperative seeks to address the lack of access to nutritious and affordable food in their community, parts of which have been deemed ""food deserts.""

The idea for Fertile Ground was conceived after the closing of two Kroger grocery stores in Southeast Raleigh. To fill the gap, Fertile Ground was designed as a multi-stakeholder cooperative business, where workers, consumers, and farmers will all share the profits. Since organizing began in 2012, the nascent cooperative has signed up over 300 members.

""It's not just a question of a grocery store,"" said Fertile Ground organizer Ajamu Dillahunt, a longtime community leader and activist, and a former board chair of the Institute for Southern Studies, publisher of Facing South. ""We're not doing it in the framework of entrepreneurs looking for business. The model is about democracy.""

While Fertile Ground has been met with enthusiasm by Southeast Raleigh residents, organizers have encountered difficulties that have delayed the co-op's public opening. In 2014, for example, leading conservative donor and Koch brothers ally Art Pope purchased one of the shuttered Krogers that Fertile Ground had been eyeing for its operations and opened a discount grocery store. Still looking for a permanent space, Fertile Ground has been hosting a farmers' market in spring and summer. They hope to have the co-op up and running by 2020.

Cooperatives like Fertile Ground and Opportunity Threads aim to serve as models for future cooperative ventures across the South and country. Communities in North Carolina and across the South have benefitted from cooperatives and their long history of economic cooperation. Bolstered by local organizations such as F4DC, cooperative leaders are working to lay the framework for future cooperative economic development in communities in need of alternatives.

""The overwhelming majority of people are not served well by the systems that we have,"" said F4DC co-founder Ed Whitfield. ""We want to be radically inclusive and make sure people that do not typically have access to financing through traditional means would have that access.""","Like other immigrants before them, the Maya came to Morganton in search of economic opportunity.

47,"Jul 13, 2018",The Atlantic,Reopening the Emmett Till Case Is a Cynical Play,"I was touring the museum, exiting an exhibit on the life and assassination of Evers, the former state NAACP field secretary, when I received a curious news alert. The Associated Press reported that the Department of Justice had announced it was reopening its investigation into the killing of Till, whose mutilated body was discovered by boys fishing in the Tallahatchie River in 1955. According to the news story, the DOJ announced its intentions in a report from March 2018 that’s just recently been revealed. The move was reportedly sparked by a revelation in The Blood of Emmett Till, a 2017 book by historian Timothy B. Tyson, that the accusation that had allegedly prompted Till’s lynching was false. Specifically, Carolyn Bryant Donham admitted to Tyson that her claim, which she made to her then-husband Roy Bryant and his brother J.W. Milam, that Till had sexually harassed her was a lie.

It’s unclear just what could possibly come out of the case’s reopening. Bryant and Milam are dead, and they were acquitted by a kangaroo court, after the defense told an all-white jury “that every last Anglo-Saxon one of you has the courage to free these men.” Donham turns 84 this month, and, as detailed in a forthcoming book, Let the People See: The Story of Emmett Till by Loyola University Chicago historian Elliott Gorn, she was already tried as an accessory to the lynching.* “District Attorney Chiles decided to bring one case to the Leflore County grand jury, against Carolyn Bryant as an accomplice to her husband and brother-in-law,” Gorn writes. “The jurors refused to endorse a true bill, the evidence was just too thin. Too many people were dead, too many memories cloudy, too few witnesses willing to cooperate. None of the nineteen jurors—twelve women and seven men, divided about evenly along racial lines—voted to indict.”

We already have a good sense of how Bryant and Milam killed Till, as they were brazen enough to admit to the crime in a 1956 interview with Look Magazine. If that weren’t enough, in a previous phase of the investigation the DOJ unearthed a recording of Bryant telling an informant that he’d “put [Till’s] ass in the Tallahatchie River.” The investigation’s earlier iteration, which was closed in 2007, came up zeroes, since Bryant and Milam had died by then. “In the end, the Federal agents simply reported their findings and made no recommendations regarding prosecutions,” Gorn writes.

A reader responds: The Long-Delayed Pursuit of Justice

Till’s kin, burdened most by the blatant miscarriage of justice in the case, understandably seem to seek some measure of closure, and look to this announcement with hope. “We want the process to work, and we want justice to prevail for Emmett,” Till’s cousin Deborah Watts told USA Today. Donham’s confession has likely made that drive for closure even more maddening. The terror of the Bryant clan didn’t die with the child or with the men, and the laughing and winking admissions have been taunts. Lynchings are about power, and timeless impunity is that power’s ultimate expression.","According to the news story, the DOJ announced its intentions in a report from March 2018 that’s just recently been revealed.

49,"Jan 28, 2020",Center for Public Integrity,Gulf shrimpers fight for their livelihoods in a fertilizer-fueled dead zone – Center for Public Integrity,"About this series

This story is part of a series by the Center for Public Integrity, Grist and The World about how our overuse of fertilizer harms the climate and endangers the public.

In 2010, Blanchard graduated to political battles with BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, a spill that sent 4.9 million barrels of oil into his fishing ground. Dean Blanchard Seafood took a hit, and Blanchard later told a reporter that he estimated his business was worth 15 percent of what it was before the spill. He testified in Congress and appeared on national news shows to lobby for his industry.

Increasingly, Blanchard and other Gulf Coast fishermen find themselves reckoning with a different type of pollution, a threat to ocean biodiversity and Louisiana’s $2 billion seafood industry that’s unrelated to oil and much harder to fix.

“Sometimes we’ll get thousands of pounds of shrimp a day, then the next day everything’s gone,” Blanchard said. “When the dead zone comes, it just kills everything.”

The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is a massive, oxygen-deprived swath of water concentrated off the coast of Louisiana and Texas, fed by polluted freshwater from states along the Mississippi River.

The Mississippi is born in Minnesota, its cold water bubbling over football sized rocks that edge the glacial Lake Itasca. From there it begins a walking-paced meander, 2,320 miles toward New Orleans. Like a topological funnel between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi drains 40 percent of the contiguous United States, carrying left-over nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer spread on farmland across the Midwest toward the Delta. The chemicals encourage the growth of algae, which suck up oxygen and choke marine life.

Politicians and environmental scientists from the states responsible for allowing the most fertilizer runoff into the Mississippi — Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana — are encouraging farmers to plant cover crops, change how they rotate crops and take other measures to prevent polluted river water from barreling toward the Gulf and creating a zone of hypoxia (low oxygen) in one of the country’s most fertile fishing grounds. But these scattered efforts have yet to yield much success.

Small family farms, local conservation groups and university scientists constitute the driving force of progress, leaving America’s large-scale corporate farmers silent in the background. There is no national prediction from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, its Hypoxia Task Force, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicating the total fertilizer load needed to shrink the dead zone. The problem is too complex for straightforward answers: Its outcome relies on rainfall, ocean temperature, soil health and crop growth rates.

Last year, the dead zone measured as much as 6,952 square miles, larger than Connecticut and much bigger than the 5-year average of 5,770 square miles, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Studies in the journal Science state that the global area of dead zones have quadrupled in the last 50 years, driven by a growing human population and an increase in the need for corn, soybeans, biofuels and livestock feed.

Few places have felt the consequences harder than Louisiana, the country’s second-largest source of seafood after Alaska. NOAA estimates the dead zone costs the state’s seafood and tourism industries $82 million a year. It has made the work of fishing in the Gulf even more difficult. The dead zone grows in the summer after spring rains from the Midwest wash pollutants south, forcing ocean life to flee to areas where they wouldn’t normally be found. They would normally move from inshore nurseries to offshore spawning grounds, but the lack of oxygen blocks their migration.

So trawlers have been winding up with more small shrimp and fewer of the plump ones customers favor. That decreased volume comes even with improved equipment — new evolutions in radar, winches and net technology. “So far we have 68,000 pounds a day for the month,” Blanchard said in July, usually a peak month. “Normally we average about 90,000 pounds a day.”

The changing climate plays a role, too, with increased and more intense rainfall that speeds up erosion on farmland. In May, the output of the Mississippi River and its distributary, the Atchafalaya River, was 67 percent above the long-term average between 1980 and 2018, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This discharge carried 156,000 metric tons of nitrate (the weight of more than 750 Statues of Liberty) and 25,300 metric tons of phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico last May — 18 percent and 49 percent above long-term averages, respectively.

The obvious solution is to stanch the pollution at its source upstream. But if efforts to trap runoff from farms don’t succeed, wetland restoration projects in the Delta could form a defense of last resort by redirecting the Mississippi’s polluted flow into marshland where contaminants can be absorbed before they hit the ocean.

Seth Blitch, coastal and marine conservation director at Louisiana’s outpost of The Nature Conservancy, sat at his desk in Baton Rouge last June, below a wall-to-wall satellite image of the Mississippi Delta. Like an upside-down tree its printed lines fan out into the ocean.

Two stories below, the real-life Mississippi River slid past behind a levee. The river had breached its western bank, drowning shoreside factories and chemical plants beneath brown water full of earth, fertilizer and vegetation from the north.

After the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927 — which submerged 27,000 square miles of land along the river, killing hundreds of people — the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to raise its banks under the Flood Control Act passed the following year. Today, the Mississippi River levee system is 2,203 miles long, incorporating tributary flood walls and control stations. This mitigates flooding, but it gave birth to a new set of problems.

Before the 20th century building spree, a rush of floodwater would have spilled into wetlands, mangroves and swamps where pollutants would be filtered out by vegetation, before the water seeped toward the sea. But now the levee system funnels water flow, pollutants and sediment straight to the Gulf of Mexico. Hundreds of miles of navigation channels, pipelines and exploratory canals built by the oil and gas industry compound the problem. Dredged soil from much of that construction was piled on the edges of waterways, forming piles known as spoil banks, or spoil levees, which impede the natural flow of water. “The process of wetland renourishment by fresh water and sediment in Louisiana is severed by levees,” Blitch said.

The Atchafalaya River Basin comprises about a million acres of wetlands, covering roughly the area of Rhode Island. It typically takes a third of the Mississippi’s water. The Atchafalaya Swamp acts as a filtration system, with plants feeding on nitrogen and phosphorus and slowing the flow of water travelling south.

In 2015, The Nature Conservancy bought nearly 5,400 acres of forest there, a preservation restoration project called the Atchafalaya River Basin Initiative. Once it gets approved by state regulators, the plan is to lower spoil banks to allow nutrient-filled water back into the marshes. “The idea is to restore the flow of water and sediment such that it both floods and drains from the property more like it would have before constructed levees and spoiling altered the flow,” Blitch said. He hopes that the project might one day form a restoration framework for states throughout the Mississippi River Basin.

David Chauvin’s Seafood Company teeters on the silty marshland between the mouths of the Atchafalaya and the Mississippi Rivers in Dulac, Louisiana. On a Monday in June, teeming rain battered the tin roofs above Chauvin’s workers as they readied shrimp storage equipment, racing to unload boats escaping the storm. The rain bounced off concrete slick with diesel and fish oil. And a Bobcat mini-digger ferried bucketloads of ice between the freezer and shrimp storage bins, pushing its way through insulation curtains, orange headlights cutting through mist.

Chauvin’s wife, Kim, was frantic — one of their four shrimp trawlers was caught on a sand bar on Grand Isle, near Dean Blanchard’s place, 70 miles east. Switching from cell phone to cell phone, she tried to compile information and mount a rescue plan for a worst-case scenario.

“On the one hand we have tropical depressions, on the other we have this humongous dead zone,” she said. “We’re between a rock and a hard place.”

Kim Chauvin has met with farming groups keen to help clean up the Gulf Coast. She found that local and family-owned farmers were sympathetic to the plight of shrimpers and recognized their role in the chain of pollution. “I don’t blame the mom and pops,” she said. “It’s usually big corporations who think they don’t have to change.”

Big or small, farmers are largely free to do what they want, because federal regulations don’t require them to curb fertilizer runoff. Oversight mostly falls to state agencies that are often keen on voluntary efforts in place of enforcing rules. Kim Chauvin would like to see strict federal limits on agricultural pollution entering the Mississippi, backed by fines for non-compliance and reparations for historical damage to Louisiana’s shrimping industry.

Federal agencies have launched efforts to attack the problem. The USDA has granted millions of dollars to agricultural and conservation groups for the development of nutrient reduction strategies. And in 1997, the EPA organized what is now called the Hypoxia Task Force, which later pledged to shrink the dead zone by three quarters before 2015.

But at the end of 2014, with no progress in sight, the task force extended its deadline to 2035, with a new pledge to hit a 20-percent reduction by 2025. There’s no evidence of success yet.

Small family farms, local conservationists, universities and some local governments have been experimenting with methods to curtail fertilizer runoff. State officials, including Brad Redlin, a manager for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture’s water-quality program, are trying to nudge farmers into better practices with incentives. They’ve started initiatives in which farmers and local governments split the costs of creating wetland filtration systems and supported new markets for harvested cover crops so that farmers can recoup some of the cost of planting.

“There’s been little to no taste for regulating agriculture,” Redlin said. “But there’s a level of reassurance that conservation systems do exist out there in the countryside.”

In 2012, Redlin designed a voluntary certification program for farmers in Minnesota, in partnership with the USDA and EPA, that established standards for agricultural water quality. When farmers sign up, the state studies their farms using software that highlights bad practices. Redlin’s program suggests alternative methods to farmers to run their operations cleaner and more efficiently — the reduction of overall fertilizer use, the planting of cover crops and limiting soil tilling, which leads to erosion.

In 2016, his network of 15 state certifiers began walking across Minnesota’s farmland, field by field, to begin assessments. The process appeals to farmers who want an assessment of the health of their whole farm. If the farm is not up to par, the farmer might have to plant cover crops or build buffers designed to interrupt the flow of runoff. Redlin now has 731 producers certified over a total area of 489,385 acres.

“It’s often expressed that 70 percent of the problem is coming from 20 percent of the people; that’s not invalid,” Redlin said. “But it seems to be a different cliché, like death by a thousand cuts. Every farm is a little bit leaky and the cumulative result is a dead zone in the Gulf.”

Mike Naig, Iowa’s secretary of agriculture, smoothed his navy-blue suit jacket as he sat at a polished wood conference table preparing to co-chair the 2019 meeting of the Hypoxia Task Force in Baton Rouge. Naig comes from a long line of farmers and still travels back to his parent’s farm in northern Iowa to help work the land.

“We all understand that we feed into the Gulf,” he said. “And shame on us if we don’t take advantage of the opportunity to show that we can be effective.”

Naig works as an intermediary between farmers, the USDA, the EPA and Congress, drumming up support for agricultural conservation projects through funding, policy changes and permitting. He helps public and private interests collaborate — farmers, fertilizer sellers, environmental scientists and governments — lining up access to equipment, technical assistance and financial aid for nutrient-reduction projects. Naig has 14 watershed demonstration projects across the state, which show how cover crops, bioreactors and wetlands can reduce nutrient runoff on working farm land on a small scale.

According to Naig’s department, his efforts have led to 1 million acres of cover crops planted and 88 completed wetlands, with another 30 under development across Iowa.

Naig thinks federal regulations to curtail runoff would backfire. If it was a regulatory obligation, he argued, the dynamic between farmers and government would breed bitterness. Top-down structures for conservation, enforced federally, he said, would mean flip-flopping on industrial and environmental goals every time a new president landed in the White House.

“We want people to use their own innovative approaches,” Naig said. “I think we’ll get to a better place, and we’ll get there faster, through unleashing people’s creativity.”

Iowa’s 2013 Nutrient Reduction Strategy, a state government initiative to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, promised a 45 percent decrease in fertilizer runoff by 2035, but despite Naig’s efforts there’s been no change yet. Experts say large-scale crop producers have yet to make adaptations to their methods of growing.

Dean Blanchard has been in business for 37 years, distributing shrimp off the barrier island of Grand Isle in the Mississippi River Delta. “When the dead zone comes,” he said, “it just kills everything.” (Spike Johnson for Grist)

For shrimpers living along the Delta like Dean Blanchard and Kim Chauvin, patience is wearing thin. “On a congressional level we need to say enough is enough,” she said. “We need to list annual goals for change and stick to the plan.”

She said that shrimpers want face-to-face meetings with large-scale commercial farmers and fertilizer companies. They want to show the consequences of current methods of farming on those who live and fish on the coasts. They want fines and regulation for offending agricultural operations and a return to healthier waters.

“We need them to understand what they’re doing to the fishing industry,” Chauvin said. “The states above us should be paying something to the industry that they’re destroying.”

50,"Sep 10, 2018",Vanity Fair,Inside One Police Chief’s Hunt for Justice in a Pair of Unsolved Mississippi Murders,"Lord, I’m going to Rosedale. —Robert Johnson, “Traveling Riverside Blues.”

As Highway 1 follows the great river through the Mississippi Delta, it pauses in Rosedale. For 10 blocks, from one end of town to the other, the highway becomes Main Street. Buildings along the route stand abandoned, roofless and derelict. Settlers originally came to Rosedale to sow cotton in its muddy soil. Since then, this Mississippi community of 1,685 (more than 90 percent of which is African-American) has distinguished itself for two reasons besides the fertile earth: its many churches and its chronic lawlessness.

On a sunny Sunday, while on assignment for a travel magazine, I join the congregation at Rosedale’s Riverside United Baptist Church. A drummer pounds out stomping rhythms as the gospel choir wails. Men wear crisp, natty suits. Women dance in white lace dresses and peach-colored gowns. As church lets out, a man walks over and introduces himself as Anthony Gibson, the chief of police in Beulah, the next town over. Having overheard that I am a journalist, he says he has a story for me. Lately, he explains, he has been looking into some cold-case homicides in which two victims, in separate incidents, had been killed with the branch of a pecan tree. One key suspect is a man who will soon be released from prison. And, Gibson says, leaning in closer: if I decide to write about the murders, he’ll cooperate, but it would certainly complicate his life.

“Why?” I ask. “Aren’t you a police chief?”

“It doesn’t matter,” he answers, looking over his shoulder. “This is the dirty South, man. Real dirty.”

Gibson breaks down the facts for me. The man he considers to be a murder suspect is named Ronnie Estes. Ronnie’s brother Carey, known as Dinky, is Rosedale’s mayor. (Dinky had Gibson fired from Rosedale’s police force 13 years ago, while Gibson was investigating the homicides.) A third Estes brother, Billy Joe, served for decades as the chief investigator and deputy sheriff overseeing Rosedale—the man largely responsible for deciding which crimes in Bolivar County would be pursued in court. Primarily due to Gibson’s efforts, Ronnie Estes was convicted in 2003—not for murder, but for sexual battery of a six-year-old girl. He got 15 years and five years’ probation. And he is scheduled for release in October. The murders remain unsolved.

I agree to meet Gibson the next morning at his office in Beulah, 10 minutes away, down Highway 1.

Highways in the Delta are long and straight. In summertime, the play of molten air on sizzling asphalt creates mirages so that the blue horizon seems to merge with the very road. Things here, at times, are more ominous than they appear. In certain graveyards, the lids of the burial vaults sit so close to the ground that the interred are actually resting near the topsoil. The waterways also hold their own dark secrets. In 1955, for example, the white men who brutally murdered a black teenager named Emmett Till drove to Rosedale the night they tied a metal cotton-gin fan around his neck and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River. He was found three days later when his feet floated up to the surface. The alleged killers—who spoke of Rosedale’s riverside as “the scariest place in the Delta”—were never imprisoned, though everyone knew they did it. The Department of Justice finally re-opened the Till case this year. But for generations, black lives have not mattered in Mississippi courts.

The scene of Patricia Horsley’s slaying, in 1994 Photograph by William Hereford.

As I drive out to Beulah, population 325, I pass rusted trailer homes and boarded-up structures. An African-American prisoner labors on the train tracks; a white officer watches over him. The two men, in a way, embody Beulah: founded in 1855 by Frank A. Montgomery, who would become a Civil War lieutenant colonel. After his slaves were freed, Montgomery started the county’s first chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. He later became a respected circuit-court judge.

Gibson—aged 47, barrel-chested, athletic, with a thin mustache—meets me at Beulah’s tiny town hall, wearing a bulletproof vest and black pants with yellow piping. He ushers me into a back room and starts telling me the story of the pecan-branch murders.

One foggy January evening in 1994, Gibson was chatting with a friend in front of Rosedale’s central hangout, the Double Quick, a convenience store, gas station, and lunch counter where Gibson last saw his former high-school classmate Patrice Horsley. Both of them were 22.

People around town said that Horsley had been having drug issues, so Gibson, a juvenile-detention officer at the time, wasn’t entirely surprised to see her arrive with Ronnie Estes. When Horsley walked over to greet Gibson, he could immediately tell that she was on crack. “You need to get off this stuff,” he told her, gently. “Girl, this is not you.” He also warned her, he says, about the company she was keeping. Estes, 28, had already been in trouble with the law. “You may not realize who you’re hangin’ with,” Gibson cautioned. “Boy, I know,” she answered, “but we’re just gonna ride around and drink a bit.” Patrice and Ronnie loaded a 48-pack of beer onto the back of a pickup. They pulled out of the parking lot, and Gibson watched their taillights head north on Highway 1.

Word soon came back that Patrice Horsley had been found dead, disfigured, and left in a field beside a graveyard. “This wasn’t a regular homicide,” Gibson tells me. Horsley’s skull was caved in. An autopsy found massive craniocerebral trauma, brain hemorrhaging, and multiple fractures to her facial bones. Her body was covered in slashes, some evidently the result of her trying to escape by running into the cemetery’s barbed-wire fence. Her body lay in a field nearby, pants around her ankles. According to several sources, the branch of a pecan tree had been forced into her.","—Robert Johnson, “Traveling Riverside Blues.”As Highway 1 follows the great river through the Mississippi Delta, it pauses in Rosedale.

52,"Jan 23, 2019",Playbill.com,Jazz Musician Wadada Leo Smith Presents the New York Debut of America's National Parks,"Jazz Musician Wadada Leo Smith Presents the New York Debut of America's National Parks

The six-movement jazz suite is performed for one night only at Jazz at Lincoln Center's The Appel Room January 26.

Visionary composer, trumpeter, and multi-instrumentalist Wadada Leo Smith brings his multimedia presentation of America’s National Parks to The Appel Room for one night only on January 26. Prepare for a breathtaking, epic, six-movement suite inspired by “the scenic splendor, historic legacy, and political controversies of the country’s public landscapes.”

Wadada Leo Smith was born in Leland, Mississippi, in the heart of the fertile grounds of the blues. This planted the seed in Wadada’s musical foundation. He started playing in marching bands and high school concerts, and by age 13 he was involved in Delta blues and other music traditions. “Watching the sun come up from the ground and go back into the ground, because where I lived it was flatland...,” he says. “The flatland teaches man such beautiful things about rising and falling. The crops growing up and becoming produce and the crops depleting themselves and being chopped and thrown back into the ground.”

Wadada’s stepfather, Alex “Little Bill” Wallace, a composer, guitarist, and one of the pioneers of electric guitar in Delta blues, gave Wadada his formal music education. In his university studies, Wadada researched a variety of music cultures: African, Japanese, Indonesian, European, and American.

Some of the artists Wadada has performed with are Anthony Braxton, Leroy Jenkins, Roscoe Mitchell, Henry Threadgill, Lester Bowie, Joseph Jarman, Cecil Taylor, Steve McCall, Anthony Davis, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Jeanne Lee, Tadao Sawai, Muhal Richard Abrams, Ed Blackwell, Kazuko Shiraishi, Han Bennink, Marion Brown, Charlie Haden, Malachi Favors Magoustous, Jack DeJohnette, Vijay Iyer, Ikue Mori, Min Xiao Fen, Bill Laswell, John Zorn, Ronald Shannon Jackson, and Frank Lowe.

America’s National Parks was released in 2016 and was voted Album of the Year by DownBeat magazine, and Wadada won as Artist of the Year and Trumpeter of the Year. The suite was also listed in the top-ten albums of the year by the New York Times and NPR. In 2017 Wadada was honored by the Jazz Journalists Association as their Musician of the Year.

As with America’s National Parks, he explains, “I do quite a lot of reflection and meditation on these projects. In this instance, it was December 2015 when my video artist Jesse Gilbert sent me Ken Burns’ documentary on the national parks. About 15 minutes into watching it, I knew immediately what my next project was going to be. I grabbed my pen and started to write about the first national park…and that was Yellowstone. It was written completely without change and orchestrated completely without change. Ken Burns said that the national parks were cathedrals. My intention was to show something different, that they were common grounds held for the community of people on the planet…not just the Americans. They represented the past—those who have passed on to the hereafter; the present; and the future—those who are coming afterward.”

For this evening’s performance, Wadada brings his quintet of Anthony Davis (piano), Ashley Walters (cello), John Lindberg (bass), Pheeroan akLaff (drums), and Jesse Gilbert (video artist). “I use a video component to bring the music and the people inside those images of the past and intermingle it together with the present. My feeling is that the parks should be independent from Congress and organized around an independent source who has no political need to be reelected. So it’s a spiritual/psychological investigation mixed with the political dynamics.”

From his early days in the Mississippi Delta to the New York City view of The Appel Room, Wadada has had a long and rewarding journey. “I just know that I’ve been blessed. I don’t have to crawl and beg to get music out of the pen, it comes through me very fast. That’s because of the will of God, not me. I’m 76 years old, and I play longer and stronger than I played when I was 22. Anything that has happened to me in life, I see it all as being from grace, from the Almighty.

For this spectacular one-night-only multimedia journey, Wadada brings his spirituality to the stage. “Music goes from heart to heart. It knits all the hearts together in one space in one self. Music causes a person to have reflection or meditation or even contemplation. Through God, human beings are made better. Music itself is the way this energy force flies. It’s not in the melody, it’s not in the harmony, it’s not in the rhythm, it’s not in the song—it’s in what goes along with the breath of life.”

“I’m hoping that the people [at the performance] experience great music, and that with that great music they may be transformed, and that that transformation will allow them moments with themselves to figure out what the next step is and how to take that next step.”

53,"Jul 7, 2019",Natchez Democrat,"Big, beautiful sunflowers brighten area summer gardens - Mississippi's Best Community Newspaper","I have seen some beautiful sunflowers this summer. Big and small, short and tall. There are over 60 varieties of sunflowers. They are native to the Americas and were exported around 1500. The common sunflower is Helianthus annuus.

USDA figures for 2014 show that there were 1.7 million acres of sunflowers planted in the United States that year with the most in North Dakota. The most common uses for sunflowers and their seeds are sunflower oil, wild bird food and livestock forage. They also act as a natural decontaminator of soil. They remove toxins such as lead, arsenic and uranium. They have been used at environmental disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima.

Many people think it is a myth that sunflowers turn to face the sun throughout the day. The fact is that this only occurs at the bud stage. The process is called heliotropism. Once the flower is in full bloom it no longer turns.

I have seen many claims regarding the record for the tallest and largest sunflower. According to the National Sunflower Association, the record for the tallest is 25 feet, 5.4 inches. The largest sunflower head is 32 inches. Both records are sourced to the 2004 Guinness World Records.

Sunflowers are easy to grow. They like fertile soil and adequate moisture but otherwise adapt to most growing conditions. They like space, the further apart you plant them the larger the stem and flower will be. They are best started in the ground rather than in seed trays. This is because they make a central tap root that likes to grow straight down and they grow better when undisturbed. Plant a few weeks beyond the average last frost date in the spring. You can continue to plant throughout the summer up to 75 days before the average first frost date. A good source for information and seeds is sunflowerselections.com.

I hope everyone enjoyed the crape myrtle festival. Remove faded flowers now to encourage a second blooming.

The Natchez Downtown Farmer’s Market is open from 8:00 a.m.-noon on Saturdays on the 100 block of South Commerce. There are fresh goods including peaches, carrots, blueberries, microgreens, eggs, lettuce, mushrooms and more. There are also baked goods and arts and crafts from local vendors.

54,"Oct 22, 2020",Kosciusko Star Herald,"starherald.net • The Star-Herald • Kosciusko, Mississippi","New chairs are a part of the modernization of Skipworth Performing Arts Center, and the Kosciusko Foundation for Excellence in Education is now raising funds for the $4 million upgrade of the Kosciusko Junior High School Auditorium through the sale of named chairs.

Donors can contribute to the cause while honoring family members, classmates, teachers, civic clubs, churches or Sunday School classes. Brass plates will designate honorees on each seat. A chair can be selected and named with a $1,000 donation.

“Kosciusko has been fertile ground for musicians through the years. The legendary band program has launched 100s of musicians into lifetime careers in music and has instilled into countless other students the attributes of hard work, perfection, precision, and high achievement. Universities, colleges, high schools, and church music programs across the South are populated by both former Kosciusko directors and students,” said Dr. Tim Alford of the KFEE. “Many former students, regardless of their career paths, have sited the former Kosciusko Band directors as formative in their life success.”

To promote the fundraising efforts, biographies of directors and drum majors from Kosciusko’s band program will be highlighted regularly in local media, as shown below. You can look for these tributes regularly in The Star-Herald.

The $4 million price tag for the project includes $270,000 the district spent to remove asbestos, repair the roof, and repaint the interior. District maintenance personnel have also worked on the carpets, seats and lighting.

While the district’s Phase I project will get the doors open for the, the KFEE project aims to turn the auditorium into an area showpiece, able to host events and shows for the larger regional community.

The group suggested naming the upgraded auditorium the Skipworth Performing Arts Center, after the man Alford said is an historic local figure with strong connections to the local arts scene. It was Skipworth who started a local band in the 1930s, begging for instruments during the depression. By 1934, the band was winning prizes.

“He established the tradition of excellence in that band and in our community,” Alford said, adding that Skipworth even went to the Tipton Street School to encourage students there to take up playing musical instruments. “He had a profound influence on people’s lives here. This would be a tribute and conveys a community idea and not just one about the school district.”

If completed as planned, the upgraded facility would likely see an enlarged lobby area for larger groups to convene by extending the building out into the current parking area a bit. The number of seats would likely be reduced slightly to accommodate more leg room and wider aisles. The current orchestra pit could be temporarily or permanently covered to allow for the stage front to be moved closer to the audience.

The 2021 class looks to have some solid headliners, but the lack of depth in the talent pool has proven to be a real challenge. There are likely still some hidden gems that remain unearthed due to a lack of in-person evaluation time this year. That is certainly a factor, but three months before the December signing period, the Magnolia state cupboard is a little more bare than normal.

Columbia High School has a pair of rising stars in defensive tackle Jaheim Oatis and running back Omar Johnson. Oatis has camped at Mississippi State and has been in touch with the Bulldogs despite a coaching change at the turn of the year. Oatis holds offers from over half of the SEC and is expected to be one of the most highly recruited players in the southeast.

Sophomore quarterback Micale Cunningham threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns, rushed for 81 yards on 16 carries and the Cardinals racked up a whopping 511 total yards to finish off an 8-5 season in Scott Satterfield's first year at the helm. Freshman running back Javian Hawkins was the workhorse for the Cardinals, rushing for 105 yards and one touchdown on 23 carries. Sophomore Chatarius Atwell provided balance through the air with nine receptions for 147 yards.

The Louisville defense -- which entered the game next-to-last in the ACC in rushing defense -- held the stout Bulldogs rushing attack to just 145 yards after star Kylin Hill was knocked out of the game with an injury.

It was the culmination of a remarkable turnaround for Satterfield, who took over a broken program following a 2-10 season under former coach Bobby Petrino. In one short season, Louisville transformed itself from the punchline of a very bad ACC joke into a program that looks more like the one that was a threat to Clemson and Florida State in the ACC Atlantic when Petrino had things cooking with quarterback Lamar Jackson.

The college football world is begging another team in the ACC to become a threat to knock Clemson off of its pedestal. Why not Louisville?

Without cotton, Memphis as we know it wouldn't exist.

The industry was fueled by the fertile soil in the Mississippi Delta, technological advancement that brought the cotton gin, slaves, later replaced by sharecroppers and others working for free or cheap, and a global demand for the crop.

Buy Photo Memphis Bicentennial (Photo: The Commercial Appeal)

Although cotton was bought and sold in Memphis for most of the half-century before the Civil War, it wasn't until after the decade after the war that a group of growers, buyers, financiers and others whose livelihoods were tied to the crop formed the Memphis Cotton Exchange in 1873.

The first location of the Cotton Exchange was in a modest building near Madison Avenue and Second Street. It then moved to a larger building near the same intersection. The final stop was the 12-story building at 65 Union Ave., where it moved in the mid-1920s and remained until it closed in 1978.

If the story of Memphis had to be told through a single building, that one at the corner of Union Avenue and Front Street — the center of what was then known as Cotton Row — is among the few that could tell it.

BLUFF CITY BICENTENNIAL: From comic to tragic, here are 200 pieces of Memphis' history

In 2006, the first floor became home to the Cotton Museum, which looks back on how cotton influenced everything in Memphis from the economy to the music to large cultural events.

""This floor sat empty from 1978 to 2006,"" said Ann Bateman, Cotton Museum manager. ""They basically walked out and locked the door. All the stuff was still here. I wouldn’t call it preserved. It was just left. ... They just literally walked out and shut the door and turned the lights out.""

Bales of cotton and pints of bourbon

Much like the name Wall Street refers to the home of the New York Stock Exchange and the financial industry ecosystem surrounding it, Cotton Row, the strip of Front Street in Downtown Memphis between Monroe and Gayoso avenues, was known simply as ""the street"" to cotton traders.

The street, including 28 buildings and two vacant lots, is now on the National Register of Historic Places. According to the National Register nomination form submitted the year before the exchange closed, the cotton trade got its formal start within the first decade of Memphis' founding.

""From 1826, when 300 bales were brought to Memphis by wagon, to the present, cotton has been important to Memphis,"" the application said, adding that by the late 1880s and 1890s, that number skyrocketed to 400,000 to 700,000 bales of cotton every year.

Much of that cotton was bought and sold along Cotton Row.

In the heart of it all was the Memphis Cotton Exchange. And on the ground level where the museum now sits was ""the floor,"" said Calvin Turley, who started his career inside the building when it was still functioning as the exchange and still runs his cotton company from the fourth floor.

On the floor, cotton merchants would gather to agree on the value of bales of compressed cotton that sat about 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide.

""For most of the history of cotton merchandising in this country, the value of a 500-pound bale of cotton was determined by a sample — approximately shoe box size, let's say — which you would look at and read like you would a book,"" Turley said.

The color of the cotton, the leaf content, and the length of the fibers when bunches were pulled apart all contributed to its value.

""You needed to be where the brokers and merchants were so you could go look at samples and determine the value of this commodity that your intention was to trade,"" he said. ""There was every good reason to have a place where people would meet one another.""

That need to be close created a cotton ecosystem.

Inside the Cotton Exchange building, cotton classers were on the top floor where the natural light was best. It was their job to examine cotton samples and sort them into different classes based on quality. The ""squidge"" worked alongside the classer as an apprentice learning the business. Until bright light bulbs were developed to mimic sunlight, this work could be done only on clear, sunny days and near windows.

Porters — usually black — maintained the street, moved cotton bales and performed other labor-intensive jobs.

Outside the building, cotton factors, who lent money to farmers to buy seed and merchants to buy cotton, set up alongside cotton insurers, warehouse representatives, steamship agents and others.

""It was to be a place where rules were made, people could gather, markets were shown on the board,"" Turley said. ""It was all about the buying and selling of cotton.""

Just as that proximity facilitated business, it also created a social order maintained by lively games of dominoes, practical jokes and often-raucous drinking.

""There was a lot of drinking on the street, which was maybe a combination of a certain level of anxiety produced by speculation during the season and then nothing to do in the summertime,"" Turley said. ""One of my first jobs was going to the Cotton Bowl liquor store and buying half pints of Old Yellowstone bourbon, which was not a very respectable brand, but it kept fires going.""

The death and rebirth of Downtown

The buildings on Cotton Row didn't match the elaborate architecture of some of the others that were rising around it, but even that was a sign of the time.

""Although built during a period of exuberant architectural expression, the Cotton Row buildings are primarily a product of function rather than prevailing fashion,"" the National Register nomination form said.

These buildings were there to get business done, not to look pretty. But just as the technology of the cotton gin helped to make the cotton industry viable, technology eventually made Cotton Row and the exchange obsolete.

While some of the world's leading cotton companies — including Dunavant Enterprises and Hohenberg Cotton, which later sold to Cargill — came from the shops on Cotton Row, as technology developed, traders could make deals over the phone from miles away and had no reason to come to Cotton Row.

As businesses disappeared and consolidated on Cotton Row, others in Downtown were shutting down too, although for different reasons.

According to Charles Crawford, a historian with the University of Memphis, as cars became more common, more and more people were willing to commute for work. As they moved east to the Memphis suburbs, businesses followed and East Memphis became the new central business district.

Opposition to school integration and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lorraine Motel only accelerated the already declining Downtown.

By the time the Memphis Cotton Exchange closed in 1978, much of Downtown was already desolate.

""You could have fired a gun down Main Street and wouldn't hit anyone,"" Crawford said.

But just as the exchange building followed the trend of a waning Downtown, it helped lead the revival.

Buy Photo The Cotton Exchange moved here to the corner of Union Avenue and Front Street in the 1920s to be even closer to the riverfront. It closed in 1978. (Photo: Brad Vest/The Commercial Appeal)

Henry Turley, who helped pioneer a wave of Downtown development and revitalization, bought the building in the mid-1980s with partner Clyde Patton. Henry Turley, Calvin Turley's brother, had already renovated two vacant buildings when he and Patton set their sights on this one.

""The building was nearly empty,"" Henry Turley said. ""There was nothing on Main Street. This place was pitiful.""

Henry Turley persuaded tenants to move in by offering part ownership of the building rather than just rental space.

After this building, Henry Turley went on to lead a new wave of residential development to encourage more density Downtown, an effort that is still underway decades later.

As for the exchange building, it is still being used for what it was always used for — offices. Now, it houses advertisers, lawyers, real estate developers and, yes, even cotton traders.

Today is a day for black joy to abound as we remember that fateful day, June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, with liberating news: The civil war has ended, and all enslaved bodies were now free! Even though the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln two years earlier on January 1, 1863, it had very little impact in Texas until General Robert Lee surrendered in April of 1865 and General Granger’s regime was powerful enough to overcome the resistance in the South.

Just the thought of the many tears and hugs and dances and praises to the high heavens that were exclaimed by countless black bodies 155 years ago, brings warmth to my face and joy to my tired soul.

60,"Mar 4, 2020",Washington Post,A wild Super Tuesday boosts Biden and brings new challenges for Sanders,"There are few commodities more valuable in political campaigns than momentum, and, right now, Biden is blessed with it in abundance for the first time in his campaign. Biden had a noticeable deficit in money and organization in the Super Tuesday states, compared with the well-resourced and well-organized Sanders.

AD

AD

2020 Democratic presidential candidates reacted as election results came in on Super Tuesday, when 1,357 delegates were up for grabs. (The Washington Post)

The rapid consolidation around Biden’s candidacy has given him what Sanders’s money and ground game could not produce, and the results Tuesday put the former vice president in position to compete on at least an even basis with the senator from Vermont for supremacy in the contest to become the party’s nominee.

For the foreseeable future, the calendar will not get easier for Sanders. In coming weeks, the states holding contests, with some exceptions, were ones that he lost to Hillary Clinton four years ago. In some of the states he won in 2016, the shift from caucuses to primaries could hold down his delegate totals even if he were to win again.

The prospect of Sanders emerging with a sizable lead in delegates after Tuesday’s voting, something that had sparked fears among establishment Democrats that he could be on an unstoppable march to the nomination, began to melt away as the returns came in Tuesday night, with a growing possibility that Biden would be more than competitive by the time all votes were counted.

AD

AD

Results from California, Super Tuesday’s biggest prize with 415 delegates, were coming in slowly early Wednesday morning, with Sanders leading and Bloomberg and Biden trailing. That state, more than any other, was considered the key to Sanders’s hopes of expanding his delegate total.

Texas, where 228 delegates were at stake, was a state Sanders hoped to win, thanks to anticipated support among Latino voters. But after starting the night behind, Biden was declared the winner early Wednesday. The margin, however, remained close enough that the Biden would not be able to gain significantly more delegates than Sanders.

But results from around the country underscored how rapidly fortunes were moving against Sanders. In Vermont, where he won more than 85 percent of the vote in 2016, he was in the low 50s. In Colorado, he won the caucuses in 2016 with nearly 60 percent of the vote. On Tuesday, he was winning with less than 40 percent.

AD

AD

Days ago, many people thought Sanders could win Minnesota over Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). On Tuesday, the state fell into Biden’s column. Biden also won Massachusetts, a state thought to be in competition between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Sanders sounded a defiant note when he addressed supporters in Burlington, Vt., and pointed to Texas and California, which together have nearly half of the more than 1,300 delegates at stake, as the linchpins of his Tuesday strategy. He also vowed to wage a fierce fight for the nomination and predicted that he would prevail and go on to defeat Trump in November.

Warren and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg remain in the race, but neither appeared to have a path to the nomination.

AD

Bloomberg spent roughly half a billion dollars with a plan to make his mark on Super Tuesday. Other than a victory in American Samoa, he was running poorly virtually everywhere and in some places with percentages so low that he would qualify for few delegates. That kind of performance will raise questions about how long he can sustain his candidacy.

Warren hoped to win her home state of Massachusetts and pick up delegates elsewhere, but she, too, was struggling to hit the threshold to qualify for delegates, though she has pledged to continue her campaign through to the convention.

AD

It will take some time to know exactly how the delegates break down from the 14 states voting on Tuesday, but based on what was happening versus what was expected, this was Biden’s night, and the final delegate numbers are certain to reflect the changed circumstances.

AD

Sanders’s victory in Vermont was expected, even though he will not win all 16 delegates as he did four years ago. In addition to Colorado, he also won Utah.

Biden’s victory in Alabama was expected, based on his strength among African Americans, but his victories in Texas, Virginia and North Carolina were hardly a given just days ago. Sanders had competed hard in those states, and pre-weekend polls — which lost their validity after South Carolina — showed a potentially close outcome. Biden also took Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma, the latter a state Sanders won in 2016.

AD

South Carolina provided a shot in the arm for Biden’s candidacy that no one could have predicted, shifting the terrain overnight. The results prompted Klobuchar and former South Bend., Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg to end their campaigns, and their immediate endorsements of Biden accelerated the consolidation.

AD

There were other elected and former elected officials who joined the Biden team at the same time. Collectively, they sent a signal to the many voters who had decided not to support Sanders but were uncertain where to put their allegiance. Establishment Democrats who a week ago were worrying about how quickly the field might shrink rushed to embrace Biden.

Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns were predicting just before Super Tuesday that the race would go far into the spring and possibly all the way to the July convention in Milwaukee. But the rapidly shifting terrain seen over the 48 hours before Tuesday’s voting changed perceptions and expectations about the balance of strength between the two leading candidates and what it may foreshadow in the coming weeks and months.

AD

The true balance won’t be known until there are complete counts from California, which could take more than a week, or anywhere else where there are questions about how many candidates met the threshold to qualify for delegates. But based on what was known Tuesday night, the race was in a far different place from what anyone expected less than a week ago.

AD

The marquee primary next week will be in Michigan. Sanders scored a major upset there four years ago against Clinton, although his victory margin was narrow. Also on the calendar next week is Missouri, a state Sanders lost by less than a percentage point and where the delegates split almost evenly. Missouri will provide another test of Biden’s and Sanders’s support among African Americans, who make up about a fifth of Democratic turnout in that state.

Because Washington state has switched from a caucus to a primary, Sanders, though favored, will have a more difficult time piling up the kind of delegate margin he did in 2016. Meanwhile, Mississippi should be fertile ground for Biden, as African Americans made up about 70 percent of the Democratic electorate there in 2016 — even more than in South Carolina.

AD

The round of primaries on March 17 includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Sanders lost Florida badly to Clinton and will face serious resistance again this year because of qualms about his left-wing agenda. He also lost Arizona and Ohio decisively. Only Illinois was close, though Sanders was on the losing end there, as well. A week after that, on March 24, Georgia holds a stand-alone primary, and there again, Biden will be favored based on the size of the African American vote.","Biden had a noticeable deficit in money and organization in the Super Tuesday states, compared with the well-resourced and well-organized Sanders.

61,"Aug 20, 2020",MarineLink,Interview: Hannan Carmeli & theDOCK: Fertile Grounds for Innovation,"There are many Venture Capital funds helping to drive innovation across industry. theDOCK, co-founded by Hannan Carmeli and Nir Gartzman, is unique in that it is working to connect the ports, shipping and logistics industries with primarily Israeli-based start-ups. We recently interviewed Carmeli for insights on the path and pace of the companies under theDOCK’s guise.

Hannan Carmeli, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of theDOCK, freely admits that he always wanted to be a ‘Chief Dreamer,’ a dream fulfilled with the creation of theDOCK in early 2017. “My entire career was focusing on operational aspects of large companies,” Carmeli said, citing his work for “a NASDAQ-traded software company” delivering solutions to Fortune 500 and Global 1000 enterprises. “I was engulfed in operations, with little time for (business) dreaming,” he said. Carmeli and Nir Gartzman founded theDOCK in early 2017, allowing him to connect his profession (high tech) with his passion for boating, seamanship, navigation. “I got the license to dream… and execute on it,” Carmeli said.

What is theDOCK

“If I were to describe in one sentence - theDOCK is a thematic (vertical) Venture Capital (VC) fund,” said Carmeli, noting that the domain of focus includes ports, shipping and logistics. Dubbing Israel ‘the startup nation,’ theDOCK team started out with events and activities, including Hackathons, Challenge-driven campaigns, meetups, and networking events, all sponsored by global partners aiming to tap new sources of innovation.

To date theDOCK has invested in 10 portfolio companies over the course of the two+ years, and it maintains an ‘extended portfolio’ of about 50 startups which showed promise. “Overall, we maintain in our CRM details and research data of some 300 startups to-date,” said Carmeli, with about 70% Israel-based and the remainder from around the world.

To facilitate meaningful tech innovation, theDOCK has relations with about 100 “major players,” including global terminal operators, port authorities, shipping companies, class societies, equipment manufacturers and shipyards, among others. “Of these, some 40 companies have sent representatives to various events and panels organized by us in Israel throughout the last three years. With eight of them we signed formal strategic relations,” said Carmeli. The growth to date has been palpable. “When we first mapped the number of Israeli startups which had any potential strategic play with ports, shipping and logistics back in 2017 - the number was 37. Today we count 105,” said Carmeli. theDOCK is always on the prowl for innovators, and in this regard Carmeli said that “for a startup to be interesting for us it has to fulfill three main criteria:”

1. Address a recognized market pain point. We are driven by challenges which are intimated with us by our global partners (leaders in the space).

2. Own deep technology. i.e. - have significant Intellectual Property (IP). It could be in any of the interesting and “hot” disciplines such as AI and Learning, Augmented Reality, underwater communication, energy and charging, etc.

3. Present a strong, coherent and committed team with good coverage of technology and business knowledge/expertise.

Maritime Opportunities Abound

While the maritime sectors generally have been conservative on the uptake of new technologies, Carmeli sees this as a positive, as the maritime, port and logistics sectors will have to innovate to keep up with developments in related sector, making it ripe for innovation leaps. “Back in 2017 when we started looking into it, we observed early indicators for change,” said Carmeli. First, “leaders in the space started nominating executives to new roles which did not exist up until then: CDO (Chief Digital Officer), VP Innovation etc. Maersk, Wartsila, PSA, Cargotec were a few such leaders, and indeed very quickly we connected and identified joint vision regarding innovation in the space. Also, we recall an interview by Soren Skou – Maersk’s CEO, in which when asked about who does he foresee as his competition in the future he provided a surprising answer (back then). it was not any of Maersk traditional competitors, rather he cited Amazon. This was a clear sign that things were going to change in the space.”

While theDOCK is still in its infancy, it has already experienced success.

• Orca / Liberty – Pilot benefitting both organizations around intelligent bridge assistance and fleet management.

• DockTech / Kirby – Pilot addressing depth mapping of segments of the Mississippi river in order to optimize barge load while maintaining safety measures.

• ArcusTeam – theDOCK led an investment round by syndicating additional funding (1+ USD million) on top of our own investment.

• AIDock – theDOCK’s network of mentor yielded an opportunity for one of its mentors to assume the role of COO with a portfolio company, benefitting both sides.

Partnership with leaders in the maritime space – Lloyd’s Register, ThyssenKrupp, Wartsila, and Maersk, to name a few, is a vital component of the success of start-ups under via theDOCK. “We usually sign one-year cooperation agreement which is framed as follows,” said Carmeli. “We first conduct a few sessions to understand the needs and challenges our partner would like to address. We then draft together a high-level annual plan (how many campaigns, KPIs for the number of startups and pilots to be identified etc.). Next step is carrying out the plan and delivering on the results.” The approach has the potential to benefit both sides, as theDOCK partners get an exciting deal flow of startups addressing the business/operational needs specified; while startups get access to data, knowledge and platform/equipment for running pilot programs.

While progress to date has been substantial, theDOCK team continues to eye the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the near and long-term.

“The pandemic is a game changer,” said Carmeli. “No man-made event could have ever inflicted such impact on our personal and business lives. The changes forced us to open our eyes to many new facts and observations. We can use zoom instead of travel. We may reduce office visits by using electronic bill of lading rather than get (in person) stamps on a piece of paper. These are just two examples of habits that changed (or accelerated) due to Covid19 and which might actually stick. That’s the upside.”

But there is a flipside, too. “On the other hand, business slowed down. With a few early stage startups struggling due to freeze of funding and pilots, for example. Young companies have all taken yet another look at their burn rate in order to increase the runway left before they get to the next round. The strong will survive as their market will look for efficiency, new offerings and optimized operations. These are fertile grounds for innovation.”

62,"Oct 7, 2020",The New York Times,Opinion | Our Leader’s Life Is at Risk. Cue the Conspiracy Theories.,"“General Harrison lived but a short time after he was installed in office,” one letter declared, and “General Taylor lived but a short time after he took his seat.” It continued, “You, sir, be careful at the king’s table what meat and drink you take.” Another reported that “I have often heard it stated by physicians, that it was an undoubted fact, that our two last Whig presidents, Generals Harrison and Taylor, came to their sudden and lamentable ends by subtle poisons.”

Those purported plots featured prominently in John Smith Dye’s “The Adder’s Den,” an 1864 conspiracy tract that treated both deaths — and the assault on Jackson, too — as parts of a “Parallax View” -style series of covert ops by Southern slaveholders. This wasn’t seen as a fringe position: The book was excerpted in The Chicago Tribune, and The New York Times ran a respectful notice that told curious readers they should “get this pamphlet and read it for themselves.”

Nor did such notions disappear after the Civil War. During the effort to impeach President Andrew Johnson, Representative James Mitchell Ashley, an Ohio Republican, declared that both Harrison and Taylor had been “poisoned for the express purpose of putting the vice presidents in the presidential office.”

By that time America had another dead president. Lincoln’s death immediately set off talk of conspiracies larger than that of John Wilkes Booth and his confederates, and Dye produced a new edition of his book blaming the same vast Southern conspiracy for Booth’s bullets. Over the years, more Lincoln theories would emerge, attributing the murder to everyone from the vice president to the Vatican.

The next president killed in office was James Garfield, shot in 1881 by a disgruntled job-seeker named Charles Guiteau. The rumor mill quickly claimed the deed had been arranged by the Republican Party’s “Stalwart” faction, whose members included Vice President Chester Alan Arthur. (One newspaper, The Baltimore American, was agnostic about whether Guiteau had acted alone, but it called the killing a coup “whether the assassin had accomplices or not.”)","Lincoln’s death immediately set off talk of conspiracies larger than that of John Wilkes Booth and his confederates, and Dye produced a new edition of his book blaming the same vast Southern conspiracy for Booth’s bullets.

“Zero ICU beds in Jackson. Very few elsewhere. Please protect yourself and your family,” Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs tweeted Thursday morning.

Zero ICU beds in Jackson. Very few elsewhere.



Please protect yourself and your family. pic.twitter.com/08CxKh6Jzd — thomas dobbs (@TCBPubHealth) November 12, 2020

There are only 106 available ICU beds remaining in the state out of 888 total, Mississippi Free Press reports. There were 1,271 new COVID-19 cases in Mississippi today.

Though there is still no mask mandate, GOP Gov. Tate Reeves, who has followed President Donald Trump’s lead and politicized the state’s response to the novel coronavirus, tweeted, “As cases rise, please take the threat seriously. None of us want to be responsible for spreading this disease to our most vulnerable loved ones.”

Reeves announced Thursday that his youngest daughter has tested positive for COVID-19.

According Mississippi Free Press, only five ICU beds remain open in Gulfport and none in Biloxi. Additionally, “There are also zero ICU beds available in Southaven and just one in nearby Olive Branch, both located in DeSoto County, where the sheriff is refusing to enforce mask and social distancing orders…In Hattiesburg, located in Forrest and Lamar counties, only one ICU bed remains (available). Greenville in Washington County is down to just one ICU bed.”

As ESSENCE previously reported, Dobbs said that white people’s refusal to wear masks and practice other safety procedures led to the increase in cases across the state.

“We’ve seen a pretty remarkable shift because early on, African-Americans accounted for basically two-thirds, or 60 percent or more, of cases and deaths,” he said on CNN. “Then over the summer, and especially going into the fall, we’ve seen that shift basically upside-down. Sixty-percent of new cases are caucasians and the deaths are nearing that also.”

Dobbs said that the state has been been working hard on safety measures, which have found “more fertile ground in the Black community.”

“As far as the case trends, we have had really pretty good uptake by a lot of folks in the Black community with masking and social distancing,” Dobbs said. “We’ve worked very aggressively to make sure that the Black community understands where the risks are and what can be done to prevent that. “And I just will say … I think big parts of the white community, especially in areas that maybe weren’t as hard-affected (previously), have not been as compliant or engaged actively with social distancing and masking. And I think that does make a difference.”

64,3 weeks ago,The New York Times,Should Black Northerners Move Back to the South?,"THE DEVIL YOU KNOW

A Black Power Manifesto

By Charles M. Blow

Leading up to the 2020 presidential election, Stacey Abrams, LaTosha Brown and other grass-roots activists successfully registered an unprecedented number of Black voters in Georgia who had been stymied in the past by voter-suppression tactics. Their work brought key victories to Democratic candidates in the state and demonstrated the political power of Southern Black women.

Georgia’s recent presidential and Senate elections are relevant to the argument of the New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow in “The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto.” There are two Black Americas, he says. One is the world of those who remained in the postslavery South. The other is inhabited by those who fled the South for refuge in what he terms “destination cities” across the North and West during the Great Migration. But these cities are now broken, according to Blow, and the Great Migration has been a “stinging failure.” Blow, a son of Louisiana who recently moved back south — to Atlanta — says Black Americans must bridge this divide.

In what he believes would be “the most audacious power play by Black America in the history of the country,” Blow calls for African-Americans to reverse-migrate south, to collectively dismantle white supremacy by using their ancestral homeland as a political base. He imagines a New South where “our trauma history is not our total history.” That Black people have been returning south for at least the past 40 years, he adds, demonstrates that there is fertile ground for his idea in the region, intellectually and materially.

His is a familiar argument, revitalized by the South’s recent political developments. A genesis for Blow’s Black power proposition could have been the Black Belt nation thesis, proposed by Black Communists in the 1920s, or the agenda of the Republic of New Afrika in the 1960s. But Blow instead builds upon the political thought of the freethinking white hippies who moved to Vermont in the early 1970s with the intent of transforming the state’s conservative electoral politics. They succeeded, he says; young Black people today should follow their blueprint.","Their work brought key victories to Democratic candidates in the state and demonstrated the political power of Southern Black women.
Georgia’s recent presidential and Senate elections are relevant to the argument of the New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow in “The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto.” There are two Black Americas, he says.

Images above: A sign on a utility pole to deter hunters, near the old Scott-family homestead, Drew, Mississippi; Willena's brother Isaac Daniel Scott Sr. amid soybeans in Mound Bayou. Updated at 2:15 p.m. ET on September 29, 2019. I. Wiped Out “You ever chop before?” Willena Scott-White was testing me. I sat with her in the cab of a Chevy Silverado pickup truck, swatting at the squadrons of giant, fluttering mosquitoes that had invaded the interior the last time she opened a window. I was spending the day with her family as they worked their fields just outside Ruleville, in Mississippi’s Leflore County. With her weathered brown hands, Scott-White gave me a pork sandwich wrapped in a grease-stained paper towel. I slapped my leg. Mosquitoes can bite through denim, it turns out. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Cotton sowed with planters must be chopped—thinned and weeded manually with hoes—to produce orderly rows of fluffy bolls. The work is backbreaking, and the people who do it maintain that no other job on Earth is quite as demanding. I had labored long hours over other crops, but had to admit to Scott-White, a 60-something grandmother who’d grown up chopping, that I’d never done it.

“Then you ain’t never worked,” she replied. The fields alongside us as we drove were monotonous. With row crops, monotony is good. But as we toured 1,000 acres of land in Leflore and Bolivar Counties, straddling Route 61, Scott-White pointed out the demarcations between plots. A trio of steel silos here. A post there. A patch of scruffy wilderness in the distance. Each landmark was a reminder of the Scott legacy that she had fought to keep—or to regain—and she noted this with pride. Each one was also a reminder of an inheritance that had once been stolen. Drive Route 61 through the Mississippi Delta and you’ll find much of the scenery exactly as it was 50 or 75 years ago. Imposing plantations and ramshackle shotgun houses still populate the countryside from Memphis to Vicksburg. Fields stretch to the horizon. The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended. But some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger—industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you’re one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. TIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the “Delta states.” The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)

Unlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil—as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland. In Holmes County, the third-blackest county in the nation, black people make up about 80 percent of the population but own only 19 percent of the farmland. TIAA owns plantations there, too. In just a few years, a single company has accumulated a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of the African Americans who have lived on and shaped this land for centuries. This is not a story about TIAA—at least not primarily. The company’s newfound dominance in the region is merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part. But TIAA’s position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains has become a structural part of American life. The land was wrested first from Native Americans, by force. It was then cleared, watered, and made productive for intensive agriculture by the labor of enslaved Africans, who after Emancipation would come to own a portion of it. Later, through a variety of means—sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal and coercive, occasionally violent—farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people. It was aggregated into larger holdings, then aggregated again, eventually attracting the interest of Wall Street.

Owners of small farms everywhere, black and white alike, have long been buffeted by larger economic forces. But what happened to black landowners in the South, and particularly in the Delta, is distinct, and was propelled not only by economic change but also by white racism and local white power. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. They have lost 12 million acres over the past century. But even that statement falsely consigns the losses to long-ago history. In fact, the losses mostly occurred within living memory, from the 1950s onward. Today, except for a handful of farmers like the Scotts who have been able to keep or get back some land, black people in this most productive corner of the Deep South own almost nothing of the bounty under their feet.

II. “Land Hunger” Land has always been the main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi. During Reconstruction, fierce resistance from the planters who had dominated antebellum society effectively killed any promise of land or protection from the Freedmen’s Bureau, forcing masses of black laborers back into de facto bondage. But the sheer size of the black population—black people were a majority in Mississippi until the 1930s—meant that thousands were able to secure tenuous footholds as landowners between Emancipation and the Great Depression. Driven by what W. E. B. Du Bois called “land hunger” among freedmen during Reconstruction, two generations of black workers squirreled away money and went after every available and affordable plot they could, no matter how marginal or hopeless. Some found sympathetic white landowners who would sell to them. Some squatted on unused land or acquired the few homesteads available to black people. Some followed visionary leaders to all-black utopian agrarian experiments, such as Mound Bayou, in Bolivar County. From March 1901: W. E. B. Du Bois’s ‘The Freedmen’s Bureau’ It was never much, and it was never close to just, but by the early 20th century, black people had something to hold on to. In 1900, according to the historian James C. Cobb, black landowners in Tunica County outnumbered white ones three to one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 25,000 black farm operators in 1910, an increase of almost 20 percent from 1900. Black farmland in Mississippi totaled 2.2 million acres in 1910—some 14 percent of all black-owned agricultural land in the country, and the most of any state.

The foothold was never secure. From the beginning, even the most enterprising black landowners found themselves fighting a war of attrition, often fraught with legal obstacles that made passing title to future generations difficult. Bohlen Lucas, one of the few black Democratic politicians in the Delta during Reconstruction (most black politicians at the time were Republicans), was born enslaved and managed to buy a 200-acre farm from his former overseer, as the historian John C. Willis has documented in his 2000 book, Forgotten Time. But, like many farmers, who often have to borrow against expected harvests to pay for equipment, supplies, and the rent or mortgage on their land, Lucas depended on credit extended by powerful lenders. In his case, credit depended specifically on white patronage, given in exchange for his help voting out the Reconstruction government—after which his patrons abandoned him. He was left with 20 acres. In Humphreys County, Lewis Spearman avoided the pitfalls of white patronage by buying less valuable wooded tracts and grazing cattle there as he moved into cotton. (Spearman’s biographical details, too, appear in Forgotten Time.) But when cotton crashed in the 1880s, Spearman, over his head in debt, crashed with it.* Around the turn of the century, in Leflore County, a black farm organizer and proponent of self-sufficiency—referred to as a “notoriously bad Negro” in the local newspapers—led a black populist awakening, marching defiantly and by some accounts bringing boycotts against white merchants. White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children. The fate of the “bad Negro” in question, named Oliver Cromwell, is uncertain. Some sources say he escaped to Jackson, and into anonymity.

Like so many of his forebears, Ed Scott Sr., Willena Scott-White’s grandfather, acquired his land through not much more than force of will. As recorded in the thick binders of family history that Willena had brought along in the truck, and that we flipped through between stretches of work in the fields, his life had attained the gloss of folklore. He was born in 1886 in western Alabama, a generation removed from bondage. Spurred by that same land hunger, Scott took his young family to the Delta, seeking opportunities to farm his own property. He sharecropped and rented, and managed large farms for white planters, who valued his ability to run their sprawling estates. One of these men was Palmer H. Brooks, who owned a 7,000-acre plantation in Mississippi’s Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Brooks was uncommonly progressive, encouraging entrepreneurship among the black laborers on his plantation, building schools and churches for them, and providing loans. Scott was ready when Brooks decided to sell plots to black laborers, and he bought his first 100 acres. Unlike Bohlen Lucas, Scott largely avoided politics. Unlike Lewis Spearman, he paid his debts and kept some close white allies—a necessity, since he usually rejected government assistance. And unlike Oliver Cromwell, he led his community under the rules already in place, appearing content with what he’d earned for his family in an environment of total segregation. He leveraged technical skills and a talent for management to impress sympathetic white people and disarm hostile ones. “Granddaddy always had nice vehicles,” Scott-White told me. They were a trapping of pride in a life of toil. As was true in most rural areas at the time, a new truck was not just a flashy sign of prosperity but also a sort of credit score. Wearing starched dress shirts served the same purpose, elevating Scott in certain respects—always within limits—even above some white farmers who drove into town in dirty overalls. The trucks got shinier as his holdings grew. By the time Scott died, in 1957, he had amassed more than 1,000 acres of farmland.

Scott-White guided me right up to the Quiver River, where the legend of her family began. It was a choked, green-brown gurgle of a thing, the kind of lazy waterway that one imagines to be brimming with fat, yawning catfish and snakes. “Mr. Brooks sold all of the land on the east side of this river to black folks,” Scott-White told me. She swept her arm to encompass the endless acres. “All of these were once owned by black families.”

III. The Great Dispossession That era of black ownership, in the Delta and throughout the country, was already fading by the time Scott died. As the historian Pete Daniel recounts, half a million black-owned farms across the country failed in the 25 years after 1950. Joe Brooks, the former president of the Emergency Land Fund, a group founded in 1972 to fight the problem of dispossession, has estimated that something on the order of 6 million acres was lost by black farmers from 1950 to 1969. That’s an average of 820 acres a day—an area the size of New York’s Central Park erased with each sunset. Black-owned cotton farms in the South almost completely disappeared, diminishing from 87,000 to just over 3,000 in the 1960s alone. According to the Census of Agriculture, the racial disparity in farm acreage increased in Mississippi from 1950 to 1964, when black farmers lost almost 800,000 acres of land. An analysis for The Atlantic by a research team that included Dania Francis, at the University of Massachusetts, and Darrick Hamilton, at Ohio State, translates this land loss into a financial loss—including both property and income—of $3.7 billion to $6.6 billion in today’s dollars.

Jesmyn Ward: Racism is ‘built into the very bones’ of Mississippi This was a silent and devastating catastrophe, one created and maintained by federal policy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal life raft for agriculture helped start the trend in 1937 with the establishment of the Farm Security Administration, an agency within the Department of Agriculture. Although the FSA ostensibly existed to help the country’s small farmers, as happened with much of the rest of the New Deal, white administrators often ignored or targeted poor black people—denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people. After Roosevelt’s death, in 1945, conservatives in Congress replaced the FSA with the Farmers Home Administration, or FmHA. The FmHA quickly transformed the FSA’s programs for small farmers, establishing the sinews of the loan-and-subsidy structure that undergirds American agriculture today. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration created the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, a complementary program to the FmHA that also provided loans to farmers. The ASCS was a federal effort—also within the Department of Agriculture—but, crucially, the members of committees doling out money and credit were elected locally, during a time when black people were prohibited from voting. Through these programs, and through massive crop and surplus purchasing, the USDA became the safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta. The department could offer better loan terms to risky farmers than banks and other lenders, and mostly outcompeted private credit. In his book Dispossession, Daniel calls the setup “agrigovernment.” Land-grant universities pumped out both farm operators and the USDA agents who connected those operators to federal money. Large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed. The mega-farms held sway over agricultural policy, resulting in more money, at better interest rates, for the plantations themselves. At every level of agrigovernment, the leaders were white.

Major audits and investigations of the USDA have found that illegal pressures levied through its loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from black to white farmers, especially in the period just after the 1950s. In 1965, the United States Commission on Civil Rights uncovered blatant and dramatic racial differences in the level of federal investment in farmers. The commission found that in a sample of counties across the South, the FmHA provided much larger loans for small and medium-size white-owned farms, relative to net worth, than it did for similarly sized black-owned farms—evidence that racial discrimination “has served to accelerate the displacement and impoverishment of the Negro farmer.” In Sunflower County, a man named Ted Keenan told investigators that in 1956, local banks had denied him loans after a bad crop because of his position with the NAACP, where he openly advocated for voting rights. The FmHA had denied him loans as well. Keenan described how Eugene Fisackerly, the leader of the White Citizens’ Council in Sunflower County, together with representatives of Senator James Eastland, a notorious white supremacist who maintained a large plantation there, had intimidated him into renouncing his affiliation with the NAACP and agreeing not to vote. Only then did Eastland’s man call the local FmHA agent, prompting him to reconsider Keenan’s loan. A landmark 2001 investigation by the Associated Press into extortion, exploitation, and theft directed against black farmers uncovered more than 100 cases like Keenan’s. In the 1950s and ’60s, Norman Weathersby, a Holmes County Chevrolet dealer who enjoyed a local monopoly on trucks and heavy farm equipment, required black farmers to put up land as collateral for loans on equipment. A close friend of his, William Strider, was the local FmHA agent. Black farmers in the area claimed that the two ran a racket: Strider would slow-walk them on FmHA loans, which meant they would then default on Weathersby’s loans and lose their land to him. Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. Analyzing the history of federal programs, the Emergency Land Fund emphasizes a key distinction. While most of the black land loss appears on its face to have been through legal mechanisms—“the tax sale; the partition sale; and the foreclosure”—it mainly stemmed from illegal pressures, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and speculators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. Discriminatory loan servicing and loan denial by white-controlled FmHA and ASCS committees forced black farmers into foreclosure, after which their property could be purchased by wealthy landowners, almost all of whom were white. Discrimination by private lenders had the same result. Many black farmers who escaped foreclosure were defrauded by white tax assessors who set assessments too high, leading to unaffordable tax obligations. The inevitable result: tax sales, where, again, the land was purchased by wealthy white people. Black people’s lack of access to legal services complicated inheritances and put family claims to title in jeopardy. Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn’t a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner.

In interviews with researchers from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in 1985, Henry Woodard Sr., an African American who had bought land in the 1950s in Tunica County, said he had managed to keep up for years through a combination of his own industry, small loans from the FmHA and white banks, and the rental of additional land from other hard-pressed black landowners. Then, in 1966, the activist James Meredith—whose 1962 fight to integrate Ole Miss sparked deadly riots and a wave of white backlash—embarked on the famous March Against Fear. The next planting season, Woodard recalled, his white lenders ignored him. “I sensed that it was because of this march,” he said. “And it was a lady told me—I was at the post office and she told me, she said, ‘Henry, you Negroes, y’all want to live like white folks. Y’all don’t know how white folks live. But y’all are gonna have to be on your own now.’ ” Woodard’s story would have been familiar to countless farmers in the Delta. In Holmes County, a crucible of the voting-rights movement, a black effort to integrate the local ASCS committees was so successful that it was subject to surveillance and sabotage by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official agency created by Governor J. P. Coleman in 1956 to resist integration. Black landowners involved in running for the committees or organizing for votes faced fierce retaliation. In 1965, The New Republic reported that in Issaquena County, just north of Vicksburg, the “insurance of Negroes active in the ASCS elections had been canceled, loans were denied to Negroes on all crops but cotton, and ballots were not mailed to Negro wives who were co-owners of land.” Even in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, formal and informal complaints against the USDA poured out of the Delta.

These cases of dispossession can only be called theft. While the civil-rights era is remembered as a time of victories against disenfranchisement and segregation, many realities never changed. The engine of white wealth built on kleptocracy—which powered both Jim Crow and its slave-state precursor—continued to run. The black population in Mississippi declined by almost one-fifth from 1950 to 1970, as the white population increased by the exact same percentage. Farmers slipped away one by one into the night, appearing later as laborers in Chicago and Detroit. By the time black people truly gained the ballot in Mississippi, they were a clear minority, held in thrall to a white conservative supermajority. Nikole Hannah-Jones: Freedom Summer, 1964: Did it really change Mississippi? Mass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. But some white people undeniably would have organized it this way if they could have. The civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin reported in 1956 that documents taken from the office of Robert Patterson, one of the founding fathers of the White Citizens’ Councils, proposed a “master plan” to force hundreds of thousands of black people from Mississippi in order to reduce their potential voting power. Patterson envisioned, in Rustin’s words, “the decline of the small independent farmer” and ample doses of “economic pressure.”

An upheaval of this scale and speed—the destruction of black farming, an occupation that had defined the African American experience—might in any other context be described as a revolution, or seen as a historical fulcrum. But it came and went with little remark. IV. The Catfish Boom World War II transformed America in many ways. It certainly transformed a generation of southern black men. That generation included Medgar Evers, a future civil-rights martyr, assassinated while leading the Mississippi NAACP; he served in a segregated transportation company in Europe during the war. It included Willena’s father, Ed Scott Jr., who also served in a segregated transportation company. These men were less patient, more defiant, and in many ways more reckless than their fathers and grandfathers had been. They chafed under a system that forced them to relearn how to bow and scrape, as if the war had never happened. In the younger Scott’s case, wartime service sharpened his inherited land hunger, pushing him to seek more land and greater financial independence, both for himself and for his community. One of his siblings told his biographer, Julian Rankin, that the family’s deepest conviction was that “a million years from now … this land will still be Scotts’ land.” Upon his return to the Delta, Scott continued down his father’s hard path, avoiding any interface with the FmHA and the public portions of the agrigovernment system, which by that time had spread its tendrils throughout Sunflower and Leflore Counties. He leaned on the friendships he and his father had made with local business owners and farmers, and secured credit for growing his holdings from friendly white bankers. Influenced by the civil-rights movement and its emphasis on community solidarity and activism, Scott borrowed from Oliver Cromwell’s self-sufficiency playbook too. He used his status to provide opportunities for other black farmers and laborers. “Daddy said that everyone who worked for us would always be able to eat,” Willena Scott-White told me. He made sure of more than that. Scott sent relatives’ and tenants’ children to school, paid for books, helped people open bank accounts and buy their own land. When civil-rights activists made their way down for Mississippi’s Freedom Summer, in 1964, he packed up meals and brought them to rallies.

When Scott-White thinks of her father, who died in 2015, she seems to become a young girl again. With allowances for nostalgia, she recalls a certain kind of country poorness-but-not-poverty, whereby children ran barefoot and worked from the moment they could walk, but ate well, lived in houses with solid floors and tight roofs, and went to high school and college if they showed skill. “We lived in something like a utopia,” Scott-White told me. But things changed at the tail end of the 1970s. Plummeting commodity prices forced highly leveraged farmers to seek loans wherever they could find them. Combined with the accelerating inflation of that decade, the beginnings of the farm-credit crisis made farming at scale without federal assistance impossible. Yet federal help—even then, two decades after the Civil Rights Act—was not available for most black farmers. According to a 2005 article in The Nation, “In 1984 and 1985, at the height of the farm crisis, the USDA lent a total of $1.3 billion to nearly 16,000 farmers to help them maintain their land. Only 209 of those farmers were black.” As Rankin tells it in his biography, Catfish Dream, Scott made his first visit to an FmHA office in 1978. With the assistance of Vance Nimrod, a white man who worked with the black-owned Delta Foundation, a nonprofit promoting economic advancement for black Mississippians, Scott secured an operating loan for a season of soybeans and rice from the FmHA agent Delbert Edwards. The first time was easy—although, crucially, Nimrod accompanied him to the Leflore County office, in Greenwood. When Scott returned the next year without Nimrod, driving a shiny new truck the way his father used to, Edwards asked where Nimrod was. According to Rankin, Scott told the agent that Nimrod had only come to help secure that first loan; he wasn’t a business partner. When Edwards saw Scott’s vehicle, he seemed perplexed. “Who told you to buy a new truck?” he asked. Edwards ended up denying the requested loan amount.

At the same time, Edwards and the FmHA were moving to help local white farmers weather the storm, often by advising them to get into raising catfish. Commercial catfish farming was a relatively new industry, and it had found a home in the Delta as prices for row crops crashed and new legislation gave the USDA power and incentive to build up domestic fish farming. FmHA agents pushed white farmers to convert wide fields on the floodplain into giant catfish ponds, many of which would become contract-growing hubs for Delta Pride Catfish, a cooperative that quickly evolved into a local monopoly. The federal government poured millions of dollars into the catfish boom by way of FmHA loans, many of which were seized on by the largest white landowners, and kept those white landowners solvent. Mississippi became the catfish capital of the world in the 1970s. But the FmHA did not reach out to Scott, nor is there evidence that it supported the ambitions of any black farmers who might have wanted to get into catfish. Scott decided to get into catfish anyway, digging eight ponds in fields where rice had grown the season before. He found his own catfish stocks and learned the ins and outs of the industry pretty much on his own. Scott finished digging his ponds in 1981, at which point, according to Rankin, Edwards of the FmHA visited the property and told him point-blank: “Don’t think I’m giving you any damn money for that dirt you’re moving.” The Mississippi FmHA would eventually compel Edwards to provide loans for Scott’s catfish operation for 1981 and 1982. But as court records show, the amount approved was far less than what white catfish farmers usually got—white farmers sometimes received double or triple the amount per acre that Scott did—and enough to stock only four of the eight ponds. (Edwards could not be reached for comment on any of the episodes recounted here.)

Scott’s Fresh Catfish opened in 1983. As a marker outside the old processing shed now indicates, it was the first catfish plant in the country owned by an African American. But discrimination doomed the enterprise before it really began. Without enough capital, Scott was never able to raise fish at the volume he needed. He claimed in court and later to Rankin that he had also been denied a chance to purchase stock in Delta Pride—a requirement to become a contract grower—because he was black. Without access to a cooperative, he had to do the processing and packaging himself, adding to the cost of his product. In 2006, Delta Pride and Country Select Catfish were combined into a new business entity, Consolidated Catfish Producers. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Consolidated Catfish said that no employee at the new company could “definitively answer” questions about Scott or alleged discrimination against him.

Scott was in his 60s by the time his plant got off the ground. The effort took a toll. He slowly went blind. Arthritis claimed his joints. His heart began to fail. The plant limped quietly through the ’80s and then shut down. Lenders began the process of foreclosing on some of Scott’s cropland as early as 1983. In 1995, the FmHA approved a request from Scott to lease most of his remaining acres. The USDA itself had claimed most of his land by the late 1980s. The downfall of the Scott catfish enterprise was proof of the strength and endurance of what the federal government would later state could be seen as a federally funded “conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.” The Scotts were not small-timers. They had the kind of work ethic and country savvy that are usually respected around the Delta. When the powers that be finally prevailed over Ed Scott Jr., they had completed something decisive, something that even today feels as if it cannot be undone. V. Farmers in Suits But land is never really lost, not in America. Twelve million acres of farmland in a country that has become a global breadbasket carries immense value, and the dispossessed land in the Delta is some of the most productive in America. The soil on the alluvial plain is rich. The region is warm and wet. Much of the land is perfect for industrialized agriculture.

Some white landowners, like Norman Weathersby, themselves the beneficiaries of government-funded dispossession, left land to their children. Some sold off to their peers, and others saw their land gobbled up by even larger white-owned farms. Nowadays, as fewer and fewer of the children of aging white landowners want to continue farming, more land has wound up in the hands of trusts and investors. Over the past 20 years, the real power brokers in the Delta are less likely to be good ol’ boys and more likely to be suited venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers, and agribusiness consultants who run farms with the cold precision of giant circuit boards. One new addition to the mix is pension funds. Previously, farmland had never been a choice asset class for large-scale investing. In 1981, what was then called the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) released a report exploring a proposal by a firm seeking pension-investment opportunities in farmland. The report essentially laughed off the prospect. The authors found that only about one dollar of every $4,429 in retirement funds was invested in farmland.

But commodity prices increased, and land values rose. In 2008, a weakened dollar forced major funds to broaden their search for hedges against inflation. “The market in agricultural land in the U.S. is currently experiencing a boom,” an industry analyst, Tom Vulcan, wrote that year. He took note of the recent entry of TIAA-CREF, which had “spent some $340 million on farmland across seven states.” TIAA, as the company is now called, would soon become the biggest pension-fund player in the agricultural real-estate game across the globe. In 2010, TIAA bought a controlling interest in Westchester Group, a major agricultural-asset manager. In 2014, it bought Nuveen, another large asset-management firm. In 2015, with Nuveen directing its overall investment strategy and Westchester and other smaller subsidiaries operating as purchasers and managers, TIAA raised $3 billion for a new global farmland-investment partnership. By the close of 2016, Nuveen’s management portfolio included nearly 2 million acres of farmland, worth close to $6 billion.

Investment in farmland has proved troublesome for TIAA in Mississippi and elsewhere. TIAA is a pension company originally set up for teachers and professors and people in the nonprofit world. It has cultivated a reputation for social responsibility: promoting environmental sustainability and respecting land rights, labor rights, and resource rights. TIAA has endorsed the United Nations–affiliated Principles for Responsible Investment, which include special provisions for investment in farmland, including specific guidelines with regard to sustainability, leasing practices, and establishing the provenance of tracts of land. Each black farmer who left the region represented a tiny withdrawal from one side of a cosmic balance sheet and a deposit on the other side. The company has faced pushback for its move into agriculture. In 2015, the international nonprofit Grain, which advocates for local control of farmland by small farmers, released the results of an investigation accusing TIAA’s farmland-investment arm of skirting laws limiting foreign land acquisition in its purchase of more than half a million acres in Brazil. The report found that TIAA had violated multiple UN guidelines in creating a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to invest in farmland without transparency. The Grain report alleges that when Brazil tightened laws designed to restrict foreign investment, TIAA purchased 49 percent of a Brazilian company that then acted as its proxy. According to The New York Times, TIAA and its subsidiaries also appear to have acquired land titles from Euclides de Carli, a businessman often described in Brazil as a big-time grileiro—a member of a class of landlords and land grabbers who use a mix of legitimate means, fraud, and violence to force small farmers off their land. In response to criticism of TIAA’s Brazil portfolio, Jose Minaya, then the head of private-markets asset management at TIAA, told WNYC’s The Takeaway: “We believe and know that we are in compliance with the law, and we are transparent about what we do in Brazil. From a title perspective, our standards are very focused around not displacing individuals or indigenous people, respecting land rights as well as human rights … In every property that we have acquired, we don’t just do due diligence on that property. We do due diligence on the sellers, whether it’s an individual or whether it’s an entity.”

TIAA’s land dealings have faced scrutiny in the United States as well. In 2012, the National Family Farm Coalition found that the entry into agriculture of deep-pocketed institutional investors—TIAA being an example—had made it pretty much impossible for smaller farmers to compete. Institutional investment has removed millions of acres from farmers’ hands, more or less permanently. “Pension funds not only have the power to outbid smaller, local farmers, they also have the long-term goal of retaining farmland for generations,” the report noted. Asked about TIAA’s record, a spokesperson for Nuveen maintained that the company has built its Delta portfolio following ethical-investment guidelines: “We have a long history of investing responsibly in farmland, in keeping with our corporate values and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). As a long-term owner, we bring capital, professional expertise, and sustainable farming practices to each farm we own, and we are always looking to partner with expansion-minded tenants who will embrace that approach and act as good stewards of the land.” The company did not comment on the history of any individual tract in its Delta portfolio. But even assuming that every acre under management by big corporate interests in the Delta has been acquired by way of ethical-investment principles, the nature of the mid-century dispossession and its multiple layers of legitimation raise the question of whether responsible investment in farmland there is even possible. As a people and a class, black farmers were plainly targets, but the deed histories of tax sales and foreclosures don’t reveal whether individual debtors were moved off the land because of discrimination and its legal tools.

In addition, land records are spotty in rural areas, especially records from the 1950s and ’60s, and in some cases it’s unclear exactly which records the investors used to meet internal requirements. According to Tristan Quinn-Thibodeau, a campaigner and organizer at ActionAid, an anti-poverty and food-justice nonprofit, “It’s been a struggle to get this information.” The organization has tried to follow the trails of deeds and has asked TIAA—which manages ActionAid’s own pension plan—for an analysis of the provenance of its Delta portfolio. Such an analysis has not been provided. What we do know is that, whatever the specific lineage of each acre, Wall Street investors have found a lucrative new asset class whose origins lie in part in mass dispossession. We know that the vast majority of black farmland in the country is no longer in black hands, and that black farmers have suffered far more hardships than white farmers have. The historian Debra A. Reid points out that “between 1920 and 1997, the number of African Americans who farmed decreased by 98 percent, while white Americans who farmed declined by 66 percent.” Referring to the cases studied in their 2001 investigation, Dolores Barclay and Todd Lewan of the Associated Press observed that virtually all of the property lost by black farmers “is owned by whites or corporations.” The foundation of these portfolios was a system of plantations whose owners created the agrigovernment system and absorbed thousands of small black-owned farms into ever larger white-owned farms. America has its own grileiros, and they stand on land that was once someone else’s.

VI. A Deeper Excavation As we drove through the patchwork remnants of the Scotts’ land, Willena Scott-White took me to the site of Scott’s Fresh Catfish. Gleaming steel silos had turned into rusting hulks. The ponds were thick with weeds and debris. The exterior walls of the plant itself had collapsed. Rusted beams lay atop ruined machinery. Fire ants and kudzu had begun nature’s reclamation.

Late in Ed Scott Jr.’s life, as he slipped into Alzheimer’s, Willena and his lawyer, Phil Fraas, fought to keep his original hopes alive. In the Pigford v. Glickman lawsuit of 1997, thousands of black farmers and their families won settlements against the USDA for discrimination that had occurred between 1981 and the end of 1996; the outlays ultimately reached a total of $2 billion. The Scotts were one of those families, and after a long battle to prove their case—with the assistance of Scott-White’s meticulous notes and family history—in 2012 the family was awarded more than $6 million in economic damages, plus almost $400,000 in other damages and debt forgiveness. The court also helped the Scotts reclaim land possessed by the department. In a 1999 ruling, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia acknowledged that forcing the federal government to compensate black farmers would “not undo all that has been done” in centuries of government-sponsored racism. But for the Scotts, it was a start. “The telling factor, looking at it from the long view, is that at the time of World War I there were 1 million black farmers, and in 1992 there were 18,000,” Fraas told me. The settlements stemming from Pigford cover only specific recent claims of discrimination, and none stretching back to the period of the civil-rights era, when the great bulk of black-owned farms disappeared. Most people have not pushed for any kind of deeper excavation.

Any such excavation would quickly make plain the consequences of what occurred. During my drive with Scott-White, we traveled through parts of Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington Counties, three of the counties singled out by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard University research group, as among the worst in the country in terms of a child’s prospects for upward mobility. Ten counties in the Delta are among the poorest 50 in America. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on all 74,000 U.S. census tracts, four tracts in the Delta are among the lowest 100 when it comes to average life expectancy. More than 30 tracts in the Delta have an average life expectancy below 70. (The national average is 79.) In some Delta counties, the infant mortality rate is more than double the nationwide rate. As if to add gratuitous insult to injury, a new analysis from ProPublica finds that, as a result of the Internal Revenue Service’s intense scrutiny of low-income taxpayers, the Delta is audited by the IRS more heavily than any other place in the country. In sum, the areas of deepest poverty and under the darkest shadow of death are the ones where dispossession was the most far-reaching.","Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land.
“Land Hunger” Land has always been the main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi.
White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children.
Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks.
Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn’t a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner."

Roderick Red Named to Top 50 Under 40 List

Mississippi Business Journal named Roderick Red, a filmmaker and producer, and owner of Red Squared Productions, LLC (140 Wesley Ave.) in Jackson, to its Top 50 Under 40 business owners list during a ceremony at the Old Capitol Inn on Thursday, April 25. Red's friend Ryder Taff, a financial adviser and consultant, nominated him for the award.

Red, a lifelong Jackson native, went to Murrah High School and earned a bachelor's degree in broadcast production from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011. He started Red Squared Productions in 2012. The company makes videos for companies, nonprofits and individuals in Jackson, and beyond. Red Squared also makes commercials and documentaries for local nonprofits and businesses.

His company has also worked on projects such as film features for the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program and Springboard to Opportunities, as well as a promotional video for the City of Jackson and a commercial for Entergy Mississippi.

Red told the Jackson Free Press that he believes MBJ chose him for the list primarily for his work in building up his company.

""I've been at this for around seven years doing lots of work around Jackson and Mississippi,"" Red says. ""I've been working at being the best entrepreneur I can be to grow Red Squared and make it successful. To make that happen lately, I've been procuring some big contracts with the City of Jackson.""

One of the most recent projects Red has taken up with the City is for ""Fertile Ground,"" a public-art project designed to inspire dialogue about food access in Jackson. The City launched the project after receiving a $1 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2018.

Officials contracted Red Squared Productions to produce a documentary about what the City is doing for the project. The documentary will air at Fertile Ground's conclusion in May 2020, when the city will unveil art installations in downtown Jackson, the Virden Addition and the Jackson Medical Mall district.

Red Squared Productions is also a member of Southern Cult, a network of freelance graphic designers, filmmakers, musicians and more in the Jackson area who collaborate on local projects. Red also operates FLEET Creative, a creative networking organization that meets bimonthly.

Architect Jonathan Tate was living and working in Memphis, Tennessee, when Hurricane Katrina ensnared New Orleans in 2005. Instinctively drawn to the Big Easy, he later moved there for the opportunity to observe the reconstruction effort and investigate architecture’s role in it.

“Embedded in the practice from the beginning was a desire to look around and postulate,” said Tate, referring to the namesake office he founded in the Lower Garden District in 2011.

Indeed, Office of Jonathan Tate (OJT) brings a probing, “investigative” (the word and its cognates have a special resonance for the small firm) spirit to wide-ranging issues relevant to New Orleans. Its projects, which span everything from low-rise housing to planning initiatives, often combine research with philanthropic funding and aspects of community building.

Related Article The Life and Death of the Tiny Home Trend

But however diverse its portfolio, OJT has become virtually synonymous with the Starter Home* series it has developed over the better part of the past decade. These contemporary takes on speculative urban infill were awarded the 2018 AIA National Housing Award and the 2019 AIA National Honor Award (for 3016 St. Thomas and No. 4-15, Saint Thomas/Ninth, respectively), and cemented the firm’s selection for the 2020 American Academy of Arts and Letters Architecture Prize back in April.

“Our investigations started off with a very purposeful [question], ‘How can we knock down barriers?’” said designer Maggie Lloyd, alluding to OJT’s first foray into the Starter Home* series six years ago. In turn, the office gained insights—about market dynamics, say, and architecture’s complicity in pernicious socioeconomic narratives—that “have permeated everything else that we do,” Lloyd added.

Recently, OJT has been expanding the scope of its practice to the surrounding region and designing spaces for experimental nonprofit development models. Seeing New Orleans redefine itself after Katrina helped Tate and his team (which currently numbers nine) understand that every city is always going to be rebuilding in some way. “It allowed us to be more adaptable to malleable urban situations,” Lloyd said.

Like the two previous “generations” in OJT’s Starter Home* project, the S. Saratoga Street homes are a contemporary twist on affordable speculative housing aimed at first-time homeowners. The new infill units re-subdivide irregular New Orleans lots and incorporate contextual cues into their architecture for added depth. Developed in partnership with the real estate investing platform Small Change, the nation’s first equity crowdfunded single-family units work to address housing inequalities, Tate said. The projects, he added, examine “the economics around housing” and consider “why thoughtful design wasn’t available in a speculative market.”

Ground Notations (2020)

Created as a part of the public art installation Fertile Ground in Jackson, Mississippi, Ground Notations works to reconceptualize land use and educate residents about food insecurity. The site-specific installation inscribes industrial farming patterns across the historic Smith Park in the heart of the city. The geometrically ordered row crops, long bench seating, and ground mural were completed in April, but the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the official opening of the project and the corresponding Fertile Ground Expo to 2021.

Magazine Street and Travelers Hotels (2020–)

In addition to affordable housing and public art, OJT has been developing a new operational model for boutique urban hotels that leverages local artist communities toward boosting small-town tourism. “It’s a play on an affordable housing model wrapped around a business model,” Tate said. Travelers Hotel in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and the soon-to-be-completed Magazine Street hotel in New Orleans are managed by artist co-ops, whose members are afforded apartments and studio spaces above the guest rooms.

IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. You have probably seen the photos from the recent historic floods in the Midwest. Farms under feet of water, broken grain silos spilling out of last year’s harvest, drowned pigs, roads washed out, lives ruined.

As farmers in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and other states start to dry out and assess the damage, one big factor will be the dirt left behind– the soil that was washed away by the water. And I’m talking about the topsoil– rich in organic matter, and the key to the incredible fertility of Midwestern fields.

Mahdi Al-Kaisi is professor of Soil Management and Environment at Iowa State University in Ames. He’s here to discuss it with me. Welcome to Science Friday.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Thanks for having me, Ira.

IRA FLATOW: You’ve been in Iowa, one of the states hit hardest by the floods last month. What does it look like out there now?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: There is significant damage to agriculture and commercial properties and infrastructure on the east side of the state, by the Mississippi River, also on the western side, by the Missouri, where there is approximately 145,000 acres covered with water, flooded, compared to 2011, about 127,000. So there is significant damage to agriculture, business, and farmland.

IRA FLATOW: Well, let’s talk about the farmland. Let’s talk about a flooded farm. What happens to the topsoil there? How do you assess whether the topsoil has been eroded or lost?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Generally, when you have significant amount of water running off from rivers and streams, it’s going to carry a significant amount of the topsoil. And as you mentioned earlier, topsoil is the most productive part of this whole system to support crop production, growth, and animal production, and so on.

So these sediments and these soils rich, with organic matter and nutrient, won’t be carried to lakes and rivers, and basically is going to create a lot of environmental problems, clean up, and loss of productivity in the short term and the long term.

IRA FLATOW: Is there any way to measure how much loss of the topsoil there was?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Generally, in the research, what we do– that basically there is a setting you set, rain simulator on the field, and the flumes to collect the amount of sediments that run off with the different rain intensity. And basically, you could extrapolate from that measurement into the watershed or on the field.

As you have a larger scale and big landscape, it’s going to be very difficult to assess how much soil was lost. But there’s going to be a significant amount of losses, given the amount of volume of water flooded by the Missouri, where proximately 11 million acre foot of water runoff [INAUDIBLE] cover these areas, comparing to, historically, about 7.3 million acre feet in 1952.

IRA FLATOW: Wow.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: So that give you perspective.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Is there anything farmers can do to make up for the loss? Can they add the organic matter back or can they put the microbiome back?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: It definitely is going to be a lot of work. It’s going to be physical, biological, and chemical damage to the flooded soil. And what the farmers could do, actually, after the flooding recede and the ground is workable, there are several issues they can work on.

And basically, they have to have some plan grown on these flooded soils, especially now we are doing the growing season and the planting season. And some of the fields, maybe they cannot get to it. But leaving the soil bare is going to basically compromise the microbial community and this whole system.

So what we are recommending to the farmers, even if they couldn’t plant the whole season, they need to put some crops, whether cover a crop or any crop to grow, because some of these fungi basically live on the soil system, and recycling the nutrients to become available to the plants for production.

IRA FLATOW: So you wanted– so you’re saying a cover crop will actually get the microbiome that was lost or drowned in the soil to regrow?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Exactly. Because they need a medium to live on, and especially the mycorrhiza fungi, it’s critical to live on the colonized root system. And they have a symbiotic relationship between [INAUDIBLE] system, [INAUDIBLE] the carbohydrates at the same time, recycling nutrients, especially phosphorous, from the organic form into mineral form to become available to the plants.

So having living plants in the solar system is going to be very healthy to rejuvenate and compensate, or mitigate, the losses of these microbial communities due to the flooding condition.

IRA FLATOW: There’s also an opposite kind of problem, my understanding. That is soil deposited on the fields, right? It’s been moved–

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Right.

IRA FLATOW: –and gone someplace else and deposited.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Right. And especially when you look at the eastern part of Nebraska, for example, there is a lot– sandy soils are deposited on the areas. And there is a different degree of deposit. If you have a small amount, the farmers could work it out in the soil system when the soil condition dry.

But if you have a huge amount accumulated on the surface, that’s going to require some structural changes and some sand removal to bring this all back to its original condition so it’ll be farmable and you could plant the crops on these soils. So that’s going to be a lot of work, a lot of expense associated with managing these soils physically and chemically, as well.

IRA FLATOW: And are we then talking about a lost year in productivity for some of these farmers as they work? To get the soil back, they’re not going to be planting their crop? It may be too late? The soil may be too watery?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Exactly. You know, we are during the growing season now, especially the planting season, and the critical time is going to start mid April. And if you get close to May 20, May 15, every time there is a delay is going to be a decline in the productivity. So some of the areas may be not recovered till late May or June, so that will be a lost season to the farmers.

So basically, what they’re going to do is just manage the field and work on it and prepare it for the next season, putting cover crop and trying to do soil testing in the upcoming season to make sure that there is enough nutrient data to add to the soil system and so on.

IRA FLATOW: Given that we may be seeing more and more of these floods due to climate change, can farmers do anything to prepare for the next big flood?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: There is a lot of management issue that’s associated with these unpredictable events due to climate change, and these are a good indicator– what we have, these extremes with the rain events and amount of snow we got, for example, here in Iowa. From January to March, we got almost 54 inches of snow accumulated.

That’s equivalent to over 4 inches of water, and the soil could process approximately one to two inches. So the excess water is going to runoff. So if you have a system– for example, you use conservation practices, using [INAUDIBLE] or using cover crop– that’s going to build the soil system, build soil health, increase the soil storage capacity, increase the soil permeability. So when you have extreme events the excess water could be processed and moved into the soil system, reducing the surface runoff and prevent any potential erosion and sediment loss, are topsoil losses, to the streams and rivers.

So there is a lot of practices that need to be implemented. It could mitigate some of these extreme events.

IRA FLATOW: Well, that’s some terrific information, Dr. Al-Kaisi. Thank you for taking time to be with us today.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Thank you, Ira. I appreciate it.

70,3 weeks ago,Yale Environment 360,How the Loss of Soil Is Sacrificing America’s Natural Heritage,"A new study points to a stunning loss of topsoil in the Corn Belt — the result of farming practices that have depleted this once-fertile ground. Beyond diminished agricultural productivity and more carbon in the atmosphere, it is a catastrophic loss of an irreplaceable resource.

Geologically speaking, I grew up in a small farm town on the Des Moines lobe, a huge tongue-shaped remnant of glacial activity that reaches south across central Iowa. All around us were mollisols with a deep A-horizon — a type of rich black topsoil visible in farm fields for miles in every direction. In school we were taught only one thing about that soil: to be proud of it. It was a given, a blessing, a moral fact. In a sense, it seemed to have no history. Yet when I was very young, I surely must have met old people — relatives from northwest Iowa — whose elders had helped break the prairie in the late 19th century, using heavy sod-plows and the great teams of animals needed to pull those plows through tenacious tallgrass. The way I was taught, it felt, somehow, as though the prairie’s providential job had been to keep the soil ready for a time when we would need it. By the time I was in school it was hard to find living prairie anywhere in Iowa. It had nearly all been turned. You hear many different numbers regarding that black Iowa soil. It’s often repeated that the topsoil — the nutrient-rich A horizon — was some 14 to 16 inches deep when the prairie was first broken, a fantastic depth of fertility rivaled only by some regions in the Ukraine. By the mid-1970s — roughly a century after the prairie was broken — it was reported that, in places, half of that topsoil had already been lost to erosion from wind and runoff. There was a lot of talk about soil conservation, of course — about contour plowing and set-aside programs that paid farmers to keep marginal land out of cultivation. Yet year by year, the soil loss went on. There were also large-scale erosion events, like the floods of 2008 and 2013, in which parts of Iowa lost in a week what experts maintained was a sustainable yearly loss: 5 tons of soil per acre. It was possible to get a local sense of how much topsoil was being lost — in particular fields and drainages. But it’s been hard to get a region-wide, landscape-scale sense of the extent of Midwestern soil erosion — until now.

At best, 24 percent of Corn Belt topsoil has been removed by farming. At worst, 46 percent has been lost.

In late February, three geoscientists from the University of Massachusetts — Evan Thaler, Isaac Larsen, and Qian Yu — published a paper called, “The extent of soil loss across the U.S. Corn Belt.” Using high-definition satellite imagery, a recent soil carbon index, and soil spectral data, they were able to show that across the Corn Belt — which includes all of Iowa and parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana — A-horizon soil was essentially no longer present on convex slopes. What they found on those slopes was B-horizon soil — subsoil in other words, with minimal fertility, which is only exposed after A-horizon soil has been removed. What does that look like? The paper includes a satellite photo of a bare field near Clear Lake, Iowa. The low areas in the field are medium to dark brown — an indicator of A-horizon soil. But the high spots are tan and beige — the color of B-horizon soil. By calculating the exposure of B-horizon soils across the region, the scientists were able to estimate the overall loss of A-horizon soil. The number they arrived at is shocking. “We predict,” they wrote, “[that] the A-horizon has been completely removed from 35±11% of the cultivated area of the Corn Belt.” Plus or minus 11 percent is a large range of uncertainty. But its meaning is plain. At best, 24 percent of the topsoil in the Corn Belt has been completely removed by farming. At worst, 46 percent has been lost. It’s worth being clear here. The authors aren’t talking about reduced soil fertility or loss of mineral nutrients. They’re talking about the complete removal of the medium in which crops are grown — the utter bankruptcy of the organic richness that lay for centuries under the tallgrass prairie. The authors argue, in a sense, that we’ve been farming in the dark, though they’re never quite that blunt. Previous estimates of erosion, they write, “may have greatly underestimated the extent of A-horizon loss, and therefore the thickness or mass of soil that has been eroded from hillslopes in the Corn Belt.”

Inevitably, the paper goes on to calculate the economic implications of these findings. And that’s how the agricultural press (which has scarcely noticed this study so far) has read it: The loss of topsoil on 30 million acres may result in a possible $3 billion annual loss “to Midwestern farmers.” I have to admire the narrowness of that interpretation, which is completely consistent with the economic assumptions that have governed industrial farming since World War II. The catastrophic loss of an irreplaceable resource — what you might call an essential part of our common earthly heritage — is construed as an annual loss of income to the farmers who operate those farms. The narrowness of these assumptions — driven by official U.S. Department of Agriculture policy and the shared economic interests of chemical and seed companies — has made it possible to farm in a way that is little more than slow strip-mining. What drives the research behind this new study isn’t just geological or financial cost-accounting. It’s also carbon-accounting. The soils that have been eroded were once rich in organic carbon, which has also, of course, been sacrificed over time. Since World War II, the lost fertility once inherent in those carbon-rich soils has been replaced by chemical fertilizer, without adding carbonaceous material of any kind. It’s an old — and, in big ag circles, forgotten — maxim that good farmers don’t really think about raising crops: they think about improving the soil. But if all you add to soil is water and chemicals — nitrogen fertilizer (anhydrous ammonia) and glyphosate, that ubiquitous pesticide — erosion is all you can expect. We’ve been getting our food the wrong way. Industrial farming is like holding up the grocer at gunpoint for a head of lettuce — “efficient” in the short term, but eventually disastrous.

As practiced now, industrial farming is a major contributor to the global crisis of atmospheric carbon.

The good news in this study is the same old good news we’ve been hearing for years now. The main cause of soil erosion isn’t water runoff; it’s tillage — disturbing the soil in preparation for planting. The solution is a familiar one: no-till agriculture, which means direct seeding through the stubble of last year’s crops. No-till farming prevents erosion — because the soil is stabilized by last year’s roots — and it also adds carbon to the soil. As the authors note, however, long-term no-till farming (“for at least three consecutive years”) occurs on only 15 percent of the acreage in “the upper Mississippi watershed, the heart of the Corn Belt.” Good farming should mean ongoing carbon sequestration. Agricultural land should be a carbon sink. But as practiced now — with massive reliance on fossil fuels, on soils stripped of organic carbon — industrial farming is a major contributor to the global crisis of atmospheric carbon.","Yet year by year, the soil loss went on.
But it’s been hard to get a region-wide, landscape-scale sense of the extent of Midwestern soil erosion — until now.
What they found on those slopes was B-horizon soil — subsoil in other words, with minimal fertility, which is only exposed after A-horizon soil has been removed.
By calculating the exposure of B-horizon soils across the region, the scientists were able to estimate the overall loss of A-horizon soil.
The main cause of soil erosion isn’t water runoff; it’s tillage — disturbing the soil in preparation for planting."
71,"Aug 26, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,5 things Ole Miss fans need to know about Memphis,"CLOSE

It's been three years since Memphis and Ole Miss have faced off in a rivalry that dates in 1921. Here's what Ole Miss fans might want to know about their first opponent of the 2019 college football season

1. Memphis coach Mike Norvell is a hot coaching candidate?

In his fourth season, Mike Norvell is one of the brightest and most successful young coaches in the country. He has a 26-14 record over the past three seasons, including two AAC West championships.

Memphis has also finished the last two seasons ranked in the top-5 nationally in total offense. It's why this year will make it three years of speculation for Power Five coaching job due to his offensive wizardry, strong recruiting and continuing the Tigers' rise to national prominence.

2. Memphis has strong NFL pedigree

Like Ole Miss, the Tigers had a player drafted over the past six years

Recent Tigers who've made the leap include Anthony Miller, Bobby McCain, Martin Ifedi, Jake Elliott, Genard Avery and the two latest draftees in Darrell Henderson and Tony Pollard. And that doesn't count longtime Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski who is entering his 14th year with the New England Patriots.

3. Who is Memphis QB Brady White?

White is entering his second year leading the Tigers offense after passing for 3,296 yards and 26 touchdowns last season.

Like Rebels quarterback Matt Corral, White has West Coast ties being raised in California and starting his career at Arizona State. He also just completed his Master's degree in sports commerce this summer.

72,"May 20, 2020",The Atlantic,America’s Patchwork Pandemic Is Fraying Even Further,"



Link Copied



There was supposed to be a peak. But the stark turning point, when the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. finally crested and began descending sharply, never happened. Instead, America spent much of April on a disquieting plateau, with every day bringing about 30,000 new cases and about 2,000 new deaths. The graphs were more mesa than Matterhorn—flat-topped, not sharp-peaked. Only this month has the slope started gently heading downward. To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. This pattern exists because different states have experienced the coronavirus pandemic in very different ways. In the most severely pummeled places, like New York and New Jersey, COVID-19 is waning. In Texas and North Carolina, it is still taking off. In Oregon and South Carolina, it is holding steady. These trends average into a national plateau, but each state’s pattern is distinct. Currently, Hawaii’s looks like a child’s drawing of a mountain. Minnesota’s looks like the tip of a hockey stick. Maine’s looks like a (two-humped) camel. The U.S. is dealing with a patchwork pandemic.

What’s happening is not one crisis, but many interconnected ones. As we shall see, it will be harder to come to terms with such a crisis. It will be harder to bring it to heel. And it will be harder to grapple with the historical legacies that have shaped today’s patchwork. I. The Patchwork Experience A patchwork pandemic is psychologically perilous. The measures that most successfully contain the virus—testing people, tracing any contacts they might have infected, isolating them from others—all depend on “how engaged and invested the population is,” says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. “If you have all the resources in the world and an antagonistic relationship with the people, you’ll fail.” Testing matters only if people agree to get tested. Tracing succeeds only if people pick up the phone. And if those fail, the measure of last resort—social distancing—works only if people agree to sacrifice some personal freedom for the good of others. Such collective actions are aided by collective experiences. What happens when that experience unravels? “We had a strong sense of shared purpose when everything first hit,” says Danielle Allen, a political scientist at Harvard. But that communal mindset may dissipate as the virus strikes one community and spares another, and as some people hit the beaches while others are stuck at home. Patchworks of risk and response “will make it really hard for the public to get a crisp understanding of what’s happening,” Rivers says.

In one future scenario, the nation splinters. When national news diverges from local reality, “suspicions about whether the epidemic was a hoax will find fertile ground in places with a more ambiguous experience of the disease,” says Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University. Confused people will retreat to the comfort of preexisting ideologies. The White House’s baseless attempts to claim victory will further divide the already fragmented states of America. “In the face of medical uncertainty, people make decisions by returning to their own groups, which are very polarized,” says Elaine Hernandez, a sociologist at Indiana University at Bloomington. “They’ll want to avoid being stigmatized, so they’ll follow what people in their networks are doing [even if] they don’t really want to go out.” Read: Why the coronavirus hits kids and adults so differently Prevention is physically rewarding in the long term, but not emotionally rewarding in the short term. People who stay home won’t feel a pleasant dopamine kick from their continued health. Those who flock together will feel hugs and sunshine. The former will be tempted to join the latter. The media could heighten that temptation by offering what Lincoln calls “disparity in spectacle.” Fringe exceptions like anti-lockdown protests and packed restaurants, she says, are more dramatic and telegenic than people responsibly staying at home, and so more likely to be covered. The risk is that rare acts of incaution will seem like normal behavior.

“There’s a natural saturation point for images of health systems in crisis,” Lincoln adds, and newly overwhelmed hospitals might be ignored in favor of fresher narratives. The local media are better positioned to pick up the nuances of a patchwork story, but of the counties that had reported cases of COVID-19 by early April, 37 percent had lost their local newspaper in the past 15 years. If the virus does indeed resurge and states need to shut down again, people may not comply, because they’ll be misinformed and distrustful. A second future is also possible. “When this outbreak began in China, everyone said, Thank God it’s not here,” Jha says. “It moved to Western Europe and people said, They have government-run health care; that won’t happen here. Then it hit New York and Seattle, and people said, It’s the coasts. At every moment, it’s more tempting to define the other who is suffering, as opposed to seeing the commonalities we all share.” But as the virus spreads, Americans may run out of others to discriminate against. “Crises are political only until they are personal,” wrote the journalist Elaina Plott, in a piece about a Louisiana woman who convinced her conservative friends to take the coronavirus seriously after her own husband fell sick. Similarly, President Donald Trump’s claims that the virus will go away on its own will ring false to supporters who know someone fighting for breath.

There are signs that this is happening. While Trump’s popularity predictably surged during the crisis, his “rally around the flag” boost was a blip compared with the prolonged peaks of other leaders. Polls have also shown that pandemic partisanship is narrowing, with Democrats and Republicans more united in how seriously they view the threat. Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwestern University, has been surveying 200 people a day since mid-March, and “70 to 75 percent of people support most social-distancing measures,” she says. “Those are really large numbers in a society where 52 percent is often viewed as huge support. We rarely see that outside of authoritarian polling. Americans are by and large reading information in a very similar way.” Economic indicators support this view. Even in conservative states, activity plummeted before leaders closed businesses, and hasn’t rebounded since restrictions were lifted. As such, Redbird doesn’t share the widely held fear that Americans have become inured to social distancing and will refuse to suffer through it again. The bigger risk, she says, is that demoralizing bouts of shutdowns and reopenings will nix any prospect of economic recovery. “You only get to say Go out, trust me once,” she says. “They won’t believe you the second time.” Both possible futures are confounded by three aspects of COVID-19 that make the pandemic hard to grasp, and that are amplified by the patchwork effect. First, the disease progresses slowly. It seems to take an average of four or five days, and a maximum of 14, for an infected person to show symptoms. Those symptoms can take even longer to become severe enough for a hospital stay, and longer still to turn fatal. This means that new infections can take weeks to manifest in regional statistics. May’s declining cases are the result of April’s physical distancing, and the consequences of May’s reopenings won’t be felt until June at the earliest. This long gap between actions and their consequences makes it easy to learn the wrong lessons.

Read: Why some people get sicker than others Second, the pandemic is shaped by many factors. Social distancing matters, but so do testing capacity, population density, age structure, wealth, societal collectivism, and luck. Many countries that successfully controlled the coronavirus used masks; New Zealand did not. Many had decisive leaders; Hong Kong did not. It is easy to look at a patchwork and create just-so stories about why one place succumbed while another triumphed. But no single factor can explain differences across nations or regions. Third, the disease spreads unevenly. Some cases infect no one, and others infect many. In Washington State, a choir member infected 51 fellow singers during a few hours of rehearsal. In Ghana, a worker in a fish factory infected 533 colleagues. These “super-spreader events,” which are rare but pivotal, become especially important when cases dip. They mean that an untroubled region may continue that way for some time, but that once cases start growing, they can really grow. If a state reopens and sees no immediate spike in cases, is that because it was justified, because insufficient time has passed, because other things went right, or because unlucky super-spreader events haven’t yet happened? In a patchwork, these questions will be asked millions of times over, and many answers will be wrong. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a hurricane or some other disaster that will come and go, signaling an obvious moment when recovery can begin. It is not like the epidemics of fiction, which get worse until, after some medical breakthrough, they get better. It is messier, patchier, and thus harder to predict, control, or understand. “We’re in that zone that we don’t see movies made about,” says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University.

II. The Patchwork Response A patchwork was inevitable, especially when a pandemic unfolds over a nation as large as the U.S. But the White House has intensified it by devolving responsibility to the states. There is some sense to that. American public health works at a local level, delivered by more than 3,000 departments that serve specific cities, counties, tribes, and states. This decentralized system is a strength: An epidemiologist in rural Minnesota knows the needs and vulnerabilities of her community better than a federal official in Washington, D.C. But in a pandemic, the actions of 50 uncoordinated states will be less than the sum of their parts. Only the federal government has pockets deep enough to fund the extraordinary public-health effort now needed. Only it can coordinate the production of medical supplies to avoid local supply-chain choke points, and then ensure that said supplies are distributed according to need, rather than influence. Instead, Trump has repeatedly told governors to procure their own tests and medical supplies. Read: Trump is putting himself at risk for COVID-19 Michael Kilkenny of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, in West Virginia, says his state found itself short on swabs, disinfectant, and protective equipment; unable to compete in the global market; and abandoned by the White House. “It felt terrible,” he says. “We’ve been making homemade masks, or using bleach solutions. We had to fend for ourselves.” While reporting on pandemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, I heard health-care workers repeatedly joke that the 15th article of the country’s constitution is “Débrouillez-vous”—French for “Figure it out yourself.” It’s a droll resignation that when resources are scarce, the government won’t fix your problems, and it’s on you to make do. The U.S., a country that’s more than 400 times wealthier, has seemingly adopted “Débrouillez-vous” as national policy.

Even health officials in well-off states aren’t comfortable with a situation in which preparedness has more to do with wealth and connections than need. “We have everything we need,” says Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist for Utah, where Governor Gary Herbert moved quickly to buy and secure tests and supplies. “But we did it in a very capitalistic way, and that’s not the best way to deal with a pandemic.” States have tried to level the playing field on their own. Wyoming ended up with few cases but a glut of testing reagents, which it provided to Colorado and Utah when those states saw spikes, Dunn says. “There’s a small barter system, but it’s not sustainable and it doesn’t work at scale,” she says. “I don’t know if Colorado is lacking supplies. If they have a huge spike, that’ll impact Utah. It’s in our interests to make sure everyone’s protected, and without federal coordination, that’s hard to do.” In some cases, the federal government has actively undermined the states. Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, tried to buy protective equipment, but was thrice outbid by the federal government; he ended up using the New England Patriots’ jet to fly 1.2 million masks over from China, many of which turned out to be faulty. When Larry Hogan, Maryland’s Republican governor, procured 500,000 tests from South Korea, he kept them guarded in an undisclosed location so they wouldn’t be seized by the feds. This is not federalism working as intended, where different tiers of government work together. Instead of devolving control to the states, the Trump administration has ceded the U.S. to the virus.

The U.S. now heads into summer only slightly more prepared to handle the pandemic that cost it so dearly in the spring. According to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, the U.S. is now testing 366,000 people a day—a record high. But experts estimate that the country needs 500,000 to several million daily tests. Here, too, a patchwork is apparent. An analysis by NPR and Harvard’s Global Health Institute showed that in early May, only nine states were doing sufficient testing, and another 31 weren’t even halfway to their requisite threshold. “I would have hoped for more, considering the cost of that time,” says Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida. Stay-at-home orders were necessary but ruinous, economically and emotionally. Their purpose was to buy time for the country to catch its breath, steel its hospitals, and roll out a public-health plan capable of quashing the virus. Many such plans exist. Umpteen think tanks and academics have produced their own road maps for dialing society back up. These vary in their details, but are united in at least having some. By contrast, the Trump administration’s guidelines for “opening up America again” are so bereft of operational specifics that they’re like a cake recipe that simply reads, “Make cake.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared a more detailed guide but was blocked from releasing it by the White House, according to an Associated Press report. The guidance it has released seems carefully worded to avoid the term guidelines, as if it’s “trying to fly under the radar,” Wiley says. “The abdication of federal responsibility has left states with little choice but to ease the most disruptive physical-distancing measures without the testing data that would make us more confident that cases won’t rapidly surge.” (The CDC finally and quietly released a slightly abridged version of its fuller report on Tuesday.)

Read: There’s one big reason the U.S. economy can’t reopen The Trump administration “isn’t known for consistency of messaging, so we’ll never put our full faith in that,” says Kilkenny of West Virginia. “We pretty much ran our own state here.” At the time of this writing, only five states and the District of Columbia are still under some form of lockdown. A few, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Montana, eased restrictions after their caseloads had fallen to low single digits. Idaho is reopening cautiously, despite being one of the less affected states. Georgia went all in on April 24, reopening gyms, restaurants, theaters, salons, and bowling alleys at a point when it had five of the 10 counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates nationwide, and was testing just a fifth as many people as it needed to. By contrast, Utah revived businesses a week later, when it had more than enough tests for everyone with symptoms, all their contacts, high-risk groups, and even random slices of the populace. Still, Dunn, the state epidemiologist, is nervous. “If we could stick it out for even a couple more months of stricter social distancing, it would do us a world of benefit,” she says. “There are embers everywhere, and they could ignite any moment.” Some states never put their fires out at all: Texas, Alabama, Kansas, Arizona, Mississippi, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and others all reopened while cases were still rising.

Anne Applebaum: The rest of the world is laughing at Trump Legality aside, domestic-travel bans are of limited use. Even China’s extraordinary quarantine of Wuhan merely delayed the virus from reaching other parts of the mainland by three to five days. Much like social distancing, such measures only buy time. The better strategy is not to try and prevent the virus from traveling, but to build a public-health system nimble enough to catch it when it arrives. Don’t build one big wall; instead, ready a thousand nets. In this, the U.S. is also behind. Prevented health threats are less visible than present ones, which means that successful public-health departments tragically make the case for their own diminishment. Since 2008, underfunded local departments have lost more than 50,000 jobs. Even now, Cincinnati’s health department has furloughed 36 percent of its staff. “How can you have a system that’s meant to be at the front line of the defense while it’s losing the staff it needs?” Alleyne asks. Some states are trying to make up for these losses by hiring battalions of contact tracers. These people will call every infected person, talk through their needs, ask for names of anyone they’ve had close or prolonged contact with in the past two days, and call those contacts, too. The process isn’t complicated, but it is laborious. Experts have estimated that the U.S. needs 100,000 to 300,000 contact tracers, and the nation has been slow to recruit them. Selena Simmons-Duffin of NPR reported that only North Dakota had recruited enough as of May 7, although six more states and the District of Columbia were set to.

Things are improving, though. When Danielle Allen of Harvard canvassed several mayors in mid-April, they weren’t taking contact tracing seriously. When she spoke with them again in May, “they were on top of it,” she says. “I was blown away by how much changed in three weeks.” New York State alone is planning to hire 6,000 to 17,000 contact tracers, while California is aiming for 20,000. “This really is the best tool we have to manage the pandemic until we have a safe and effective vaccine,” says Crystal Watson at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Will this system, combined with mask wearing and hand-washing, be enough to contain a patchwork pandemic? Complicating matters, people with COVID-19 can spread the coronavirus before showing symptoms. And yet, that hasn’t fazed other countries. South Korea has been rightly praised for its success, and though one nightclub-goer recently sparked a surge of at least 168 cases, the country seems to have contained this new outbreak too. Basic public-health measures have similarly worked in countries as diverse as Iceland, Jordan, Singapore, Germany, and New Zealand. And they have suppressed epidemics of the past, from smallpox in the 19th century to Ebola in 2014. “Some silver bullet isn’t going to save us. We can save ourselves,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at Yale. “We have very old-school tools that beat fucking smallpox.”

These inequities will likely widen. Even before the pandemic, inequalities in poverty and access to health care “were concentrated in southern parts of the country, and in states that are politically red,” says Tiffany Joseph, a sociologist at Northeastern University. Not coincidentally, she says, those same states have tended to take social-distancing measures less seriously and reopen earlier. The price of those decisions will be disproportionately paid by black people. Adam Serwer: The coronavirus was an emergency until Trump found out who was dying Vulnerability to COVID-19 isn’t just about frequently discussed biological factors like being old; it’s also about infrequently discussed social ones. If people don’t have health insurance, or can afford to live only in areas with poorly funded hospitals, they cannot fight off the virus as those with more advantages can. If people work in poor-paying jobs that can’t be done remotely, have to commute by public transportation, or live in crowded homes, they cannot protect themselves from infection as those with more privilege can. These social factors explain why the idea of “cocooning” vulnerable populations while the rest of society proceeds as normal is facile. That cocooning already exists, and it is a bug of the system, not a feature. Entire groups of people have been pushed to the fringes of society and jammed into potential hot zones. Of the 100 largest clusters of COVID-19 in the U.S., nearly all have occurred in prisons, meatpacking plants, nursing homes, and psychiatric or developmental-care facilities. (The only exceptions are a naval vessel and three power plants; the infamous Grand Princess cruise is only No. 148 on the list.)

These places, along with homeless shelters and immigrant detention centers, are hubs for outbreaks that can easily spread to the surrounding communities. Prisons and nursing homes have staff and visitors who live in nearby towns. Large prisons, in particular, are usually situated in rural areas with small community hospitals that can be easily overrun by an outbreak. And many employees in nursing homes and meatpacking plants are immigrants who care for the nation’s elderly and process its steaks while also being cut off from health care by the Trump administration’s policies. They are both more likely to get sick, and less likely to get better. This point cannot be overstated: The pandemic patchwork exists because the U.S. is a patchwork to its core. New outbreaks will continue to flare and fester unless the country makes a serious effort to protect its most vulnerable citizens, recognizing that their risk is the result of societal failures, not personal ones. “People say you can’t fix the U.S. health system overnight, but if we’re not fixing these underlying problems, we won’t get out of this,” says Sheila Davis of Partners in Health. “We’ll just keep getting pop-ups.” Leaders can specifically place testing sites in poor, black, and brown communities, rather than the rich, white areas where they tend to be concentrated. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for example, is turning 24 churches in low-income areas into testing centers, while Maryland Governor Larry Hogan placed a testing facility in the heart of the predominantly black Prince George’s County. Officials can remove people from risky environments: Leann Bertsch, who directs the North Dakota Department of Corrections, has argued that prisoners should be freed if they are over 50, have serious illnesses, or are within two years of parole or release. A bipartisan group of 14 senators has made a similar call for decarceration.

Policies can also support people in protecting themselves. Essential workers earn low hourly wages and cannot afford to miss a shift, even if they have symptoms. “The only way to prevent them from going to work is to give them paid sick leave,” Ray says. The same goes for a minimum living wage, hazard pay, universal health care, stipends for people who are self-isolating, debt moratoriums, rent freezes, food assistance, and services to connect people with existing support. The pandemic discourse has been dominated by medical countermeasures like antibody tests (which are currently too unreliable), drugs (which are not cure-alls), and vaccines (which are almost certainly at least a year away). But social solutions like paid sick leave, which two in three low-wage workers do not have, can be implemented immediately. Imagine if the energy that went into debating the merits of hydroxychloroquine went into ensuring hazard pay, or if the president, instead of wondering out loud if disinfectant could be injected into the body, advocated for health care for all? “We have decades of social-science research that tells us these things work,” says Courtney Boen, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s a question of political will, not scientific discovery.” And while a vaccine will protect against only COVID-19 (if people agree to take it at all), social interventions will protect against the countless diseases that may emerge in the future, along with chronic illnesses, maternal mortality, and other causes of poor health. “This pandemic won’t be the last health crisis the U.S. faces,” Boen says. “If we want to be on better footing the next time, we want to reduce the things that put people at risk of being at risk.” Of all the threats we know, the COVID-19 pandemic is most like a very rapid version of climate change—global in its scope, erratic in its unfolding, and unequal in its distribution. And like climate change, there is no easy fix. Our choices are to remake society or let it be remade, to smooth the patchworks old and new or let them fray even further.","The U.S. is dealing with a patchwork pandemic.

Black people have largely been expelled from the US agricultural landscape. In 1920, nearly a million Black farmers worked on 41.4 million acres of land, making up a seventh of farm owners. Today, only about 49,000 of them remain, making up just 1.4 percent of the nation’s farm owners, and tending a scant 4.7 million acres—a nearly 90 percent loss.



This didn’t happen by accident. Since Emancipation, Black farmers have had to fight for a share of this country’s fertile ground, due to a history of racist policies and land theft. But modern sustainable agriculture owes much to Black agriculturalists, explained Leah Penniman, co-director of Soul Fire Farm in upstate New York and author of Farming While Black, on a recent episode of Bite.

Starting in the 17th century, European slave traders who forcibly moved Africans to this continent stole not just their lives and labor but also considerable agricultural knowledge, she said. The rice empire that developed in the early-US Carolinas, for instance, flourished on the farming traditions of the Senegambia region of West Africa.

Enslaved people also maintained underground farming traditions from the homeland. “Our ancestral grandmothers, when faced with the very likely possibility of being snatched up, kidnapped and forced into trans-Atlantic slave ships, gathered up the seed that their families had been saving for generations—their okra, cowpea millet, sorghum, black rice—they braided that seed into their hair,” she said. They “believed, against all odds in a future on soil—that their descendants would need to inherit that precious seed.”

Black farmers innovated farming methods that remain at the core of sustainable agriculture today.

After the post-Emancipation promise of “40 acres and a mule” crumbled under the weight of President Andrew Johnson’s racism, Penniman noted, Black agriculturalists were relegated to sharecropping, an arrangement that generated considerable wealth for the white planter class but saddled farmers with poverty-inducing debt.

“It wasn’t until the early 1900s that Black farmers began to save just enough money here and there to start to purchase meager parcels—usually 2.5 acres, five acres,” she said. Over that time, Black farmers innovated methods that remain at the core of sustainable agriculture today. George Washington Carver, a pioneering professor at Tuskegee University in Alabama, has long been trotted out during Black History Month for his achievements in finding new uses for the peanut. He’s actually a towering figure who should be known for much more than peanut mastery.

The whole reason Carver wanted farmers to grow peanuts was because he was trying to convince them to plant nitrogen-fixing legumes into diverse crop rotations, which would improve the soil in a region that had been burned by decades of mono-crop cotton farming. Carver also developed a system for disseminating his university’s research to surrounding farmers through workshops and demonstrations, as well as helping them troubleshoot problems they were encountering. Carver’s system would later take form nationwide as the US Department of Agriculture’s extension program, Penniman said.

Black farm ownership peaked in 1920. Around that time, the Ku Klux Klan and other groups led a “swift and severe backlash” to terrorize independent Black farmers, she added. These vigilante efforts went along with a set of US government policies—detailed in this great 2019 Atlantic article by Vann R. Newkirk II—that effectively expropriated Black-owned farmland, pushing it into the hands of white people. During the 20th century, the price of farmland rose by a factor of 52—making it yet another vehicle for wealth-building that African-Americans were systemically denied access to. The steady rise in land values, which has continued into the 21st century, makes it prohibitively expense for new farmers to break into agriculture, meaning that white dominance of farmland maintains plenty of momentum.

Penniman is part of a growing movement to reclaim Black farmers’ hard-won place in our country’s agriculture. Soul Fire Farm, the project she co-directs in Petersburg, N.Y., “focuses on training the next generation of Black and brown farmers, as well as providing food and medicine for our community,” she said. The farm is part of a coalition of groups “claiming sovereignty and calling for reparations of land and resources so that we can grow nourishing food and distribute it in our communities.”





Soul Fire Farm also leads the Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust, which calls on “good-hearted, good-minded people” to donate land, which will then be farmed by people of color. She said the trust has “several hundred acres” in the New York/New England queued up for transfer over the next decade; and that several other similar trusts are setting up nationwide.

Penniman said she realizes that such grassroots efforts, relying on the goodwill of white landowners, are just a beginning—not nearly enough to undo the racist legacy of land theft and agricultural-labor exploitation that dates to the origin of white settlement on the continent. Making a significant amount of farmland available to people of color and Native Americans whose ancestors were dispossessed will require a serious reparations program that includes land reform—that is, transferring some territory from wealthy, white landholders and huge investment funds to young farmers of color.

“I doubt the existing power structure and the existing status quo will go so far,” Penniman said. “It would require a fundamental shift in our relationship to the earth.”

","In 1920, nearly a million Black farmers worked on 41.4 million acres of land, making up a seventh of farm owners.
Since Emancipation, Black farmers have had to fight for a share of this country’s fertile ground, due to a history of racist policies and land theft.
Over that time, Black farmers innovated methods that remain at the core of sustainable agriculture today.
Around that time, the Ku Klux Klan and other groups led a “swift and severe backlash” to terrorize independent Black farmers, she added.
Penniman is part of a growing movement to reclaim Black farmers’ hard-won place in our country’s agriculture."
74,"Jan 22, 2020",Jackson Free Press,"OPINION: Love Letter to Jackson: You Need My Grind, Sweat and Tears","Dear Jackson,

If people really took time to get to know the soul of you, truly taking in the good with the bad, loving you would come easy. Anybody who has heard of Jackson, even those not from here can immediately vomit out a list of negatives concerning you, a predominantly black capital city. We often hear: ""Jackson? You mean Jacktown? Oh nooo, they're murderers, thieves, STD ridden, ratchet thugs."" Or, ""Capitol Street? Nah, I don't feel safe on that side of Jackson."" Or, ""There's nothing to do in Jackson. Don't make no sense for the taxes to be that high with that many potholes.""

I'm not romanticizing away all your flaws. I see the displaced homeless community as I drive up and down the crater-ridden streets, cursing under my breath as my car's rear-end scrubs against the jagged potholes, many unmarked. I read the countless articles documenting the blood spilled from innocent children, young men and women doing everyday things like I do. They are murdered on a day that started like any other, only to end in wails and gut-wrenching screams from their loved ones haunted by the question, ""Why my baby?""

The public schools are underfunded, understaffed and structurally compromised. I've sat in high-school classrooms, flipped through their battered textbooks, and talked to students with immature and negligent parents who only get hot meals when they decide to come to school. Many of our neighborhoods are unkempt, full of abandoned and condemned houses that reek of perpetuated brokenness.

I have family and friends with hearts of gold who have become hardened by racial disparity and poverty, and the only vision now is to do what it takes to survive, even if that includes robbing, selling drugs, scamming or selling their bodies for money. Jobs are scarce, and too many companies are ridden with discrimination and favoritism. As an educated, black woman millennial, I know the struggle of finding a job in your field and being paid your worth. Instead, we hustle three to four jobs of low pay just to make ends meet. On top of that, corruption has long defined capital-city politics.

That being said, I can't lie and say that I don't understand why you are so hard to love. If I didn't know better, I would do what most have already done—move to a more progressive city—but that's not how love works. When I think of you, Jackson, I think of how my siblings and I played up and down the Queens in the '90s, parking our bikes on the lawn of the candy ladies, roller skating, playing freeze tag early in the morning while waiting on the bus headed to Raines Elementary.

I think about the summers I spent at my grandma's house in the Bottom, helping her renovate the duplex next door, learning how to properly water her immaculate gardens and grocery shopping with her every Saturday at the Walmart on Ellis Avenue. She always bought us the big bag of Lifesaver Gummies. I think about the one-dollar movies I saw with my dad behind the Metrocenter and eating Cinnamon Sugar Pretzels at Auntie Annie's while shopping for school clothes with my mom.

I remember fondly coming back home to work my first 8-5 p.m. big-girl job at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in 2014. I would leave work and on the drive home through west Jackson, I'd see children outside playing, young men walking home with their friends, laughing, all sweaty from sports, and high schoolers with their instruments if they weren't still on the field practicing formations.

When I moved to West Capitol Street, I would witness the same things: parents getting up every day, pushing through the daily grind and monitoring their babies as they ran around with glee in the yard. It always warms my heart to see kids being kids and families doing what should be done to protect their children and ensure they are loved and free as they can be.

Each day I get to spend walking my puppy around downtown, I fall in love a little more with the hidden art murals, the architectural beauty of our historic buildings and the rich legacy I can almost taste with every breath. That's my reality of you, Jackson, my capital city, and just because many families are fighting disparity each day, and some of the communities are not as shiny and new as they once were, Jackson is building legacy with every generation and is now at a place of peak potential.

Most drive through you and see abandonment, emptiness, a shell of what used to be. I see a blank canvas, a fertile ground to plant seeds of innovation and progressive solutions. I see opportunity to not only rebuild, but build better.

I'll say it again: Jackson, Miss., is the new mecca for innovation and forward progress and will be an example for cities nationwide with similar back stories. I refuse to leave you right when you need my grind, sweat and tears to help set you on a hill where your light can shine. Despite those that hate you and can't see your heart, I know I'm not alone when I say I see you. I will fight for your integrity and freedom, and most importantly, I love you.

75,"Nov 27, 2019",Jackson Free Press,Kern Pratt’s Long Road: ‘That’s the Blues’,"Mississippi may arguably be more awash with musical talent than any state in the nation. As the gestation point for the blues, the fertile football of ground between Vicksburg and Memphis is the wellspring of a profound musical legacy.

Though the blues progenitors are long gone and the second wave of Delta bluesmen is dying off, the region continues to percolate with musical dynamism rooted in the blues tradition. Singer-songwriter and ace guitarist Kern Pratt is one of those who have stepped up to carry forward the music of the Delta.

Pratt, 54, grew up in Greenville, Miss. His mother died when he was 7 years old. Pratt's father owned the local Western Auto store, and it was there that Pratt first encountered the bluesmen who would become his musical avatars—Calet Emphrey (B.B. King's long-time drummer), Eddie Shaw and Eugene Powell.

""I was 7 or 8 years old when I decided that playing the blues was what I wanted to do. By the time I was 10 I was playing in a band,"" Pratt remembers.

""When I was 16, I went on the road with Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds—they had that big hit 'Don't Pull Your Love.' My first stadium gig was with them. There were 60,000 people, and I literally peed my pants—I had spandex britches on.""

During this time Pratt also gigged with blues harp artist Willie Foster, who played in Muddy Waters' band. ""Me and Willie played at Po Monkey's, outside Merigold, and many other blues joints. I played with T Model Ford, who didn't start playing guitar until he was 50 years old—he lived to be close to 100, so that turned out to be a pretty good run for him,"" Pratt says.

Since those halcyon days, Pratt has become well known on the Mississippi blues-festival circuit, amassing numerous performances at the Mississippi Delta Blues Festival and the B.B. King Homecoming in Indianola. In 2018, Pratt had a sold-out tour in Italy as co-headliner in the ""An Evening with the Blues"" tour.

Pratt also has an amicable working relationship with Bobby Rush. ""I've known Bobby Rush for over 30 years. Bobby asked me, 'Kern, how many times have we done this festival?' I said, 'Mr. Bobby, I ain't really sure."" He said, 'I think we've done about 22 of these together.""

After putting out a couple of records that ""didn't matter,"" Pratt released his well-received breakout album, ""Broken Chains,"" in 2015. The record was engineered by Nelson Blanchard, the lead singer for the band Louisiana Leroux. ""It's an album about breaking away from the chains of drug addiction. I OD'd five times—it's been a long road, but that's the blues."" The record contains the echoes of the great bluesmen who have influenced Pratt. In Pratt's guitar one can discern the spare, clean phrasing of B.B. King.

But Pratt endows each note with a trembling intensity that indelibly stamps the music as his own.

Pratt's newest album, ""Greenville, MS ... What About You?"" will be released Dec. 1, on the Endless Blues Records label. Pratt says the album is in a similar vein as ""Broken Chains"" but includes a different ensemble of musical talent. The album will include the late Gregg Allman's horn section of Marc Franklin and Kris Jensen. The producer of the record, Bob Dowell, plays trombone and the Hammond B3 organ, as well as bass. ""I want to break Bob's hands,"" Pratt says, laughing. ""No one should be able to do the things he does—he's just too damn good.""

Denise Owen, Pratt's backing singer for several years and now his partner, lends powerful vocal support—singing lead on one song and singing a duet with Pratt on another. She also plays percussion.

When asked about the state of the blues today, Pratt pauses. ""Of course the blues are alive and well, but they're going to be different. It's like Christone 'Kingfish' Ingram—my lord, he's a monster. There are some good young players coming up. A lot of people think the blues have to come from the Delta. But a lot of people take it wrong. They look at these kids coming up, a lot of whom aren't from the Delta, and they say, 'They ain't got no soul. They haven't paid any dues.' And I think they're wrong. Because these kids are working on their craft and perfecting their craft, and I think that's just as much paying dues as if you gig in a juke joint. If you're perfecting your craft, you're paying your dues.""

77,"May 29, 2019",Jackson Free Press,OPINION: A Changing Culture in Jackson and Mississippi,"Culture is the pattern in which we live as small family units, neighborhoods, cities, nations and a world. It's like a tidal wave, constantly changing how it moves and comes ashore; it's adaptive. In this adaptation, there are a few factors, which I learned about in my Sunday school class with Andy Sauerwein, a professor at Belhaven University, and Paul Rankin, an elder of our church, that contribute to the changes: participation, making things and exploration.

There is always an exchange in and out between each factor, one to another. These dictate how a culture breathes, grows and dies.

I like to think about it in the ways of baking. In kneading dough, as a person adds a new ingredient, that particular one is finding its place and seeking to balance itself with the other ingredients for optimal flavor and texture. Culture is a delicate kneading of making things, exploring and participating.

The three factors may seem self-explanatory, but let's look at them briefly. In the age of technology, people make new products just as fast as we can blink. You have those like Tesla, Gates, Jobs—they're constantly making new things and/or innovating them. If they're not making them, they're exploring new frontiers toward newer tech. Recently, there's the talk of the global race toward 5G technology that is supposed to be 20 times faster than 4G. This is a good example of exploration. The participation is the one way most people will contribute culturally. I believe it's the life and blood of culture.

As the song says, ""People make the world go round."" We, as the everyday people, are participants in local culture and beyond.

Let's look at Jackson and Mississippi. There's a new culture rising across our city and state. Because of my food and agriculture background, I believe there is no culture without agriculture. Around the Jackson area, we've seen our food culture and palate transforming with new food trucks popping up, a food hall, new bars and lounges, and restaurants bringing something fresh to our plates. In farming, we are seeing a rise in sustainable practices, and small farms growing and in turn bringing more to our food market. We are seeing our culture transform, and we're participating in it.

Just this past week, Jackson hosted ArtPlace America's 2019 annual ArtPlace Summit. The Mississippi Museum of Art and other organizations came together to invite hundreds of artists, creatives, thinkers and doers from across the nation and some islands, too. I had the pleasure to run into some of them.

The feedback I got from them about their experience at the summit and in the city was uplifting. They raved about the amazing things that are happening right now and historically. A few of them questioned me by asking, ""Why isn't Jackson a hub for art?"" I believed and hoped that they all left inspired and hopeful for Jackson and our greater Mississippi culture.

As we are in the midst of cultivation within our local culture, I must pose a few questions: How are we actively and intentionally exploring, participating and making things to contribute to our culture? What place does each of us have? What responsibility do we hold, here and now?

These questions we must answer ourselves and to no one else, but here's the opportunity to choose your role. Whatever your passion may be—your skill, your pastime—you contribute to our culture. Where you shop, live, go to church, whether you go to church at all or not. Who you choose to support through time, money, voting and work.

All of these things in our day-to-day patterns aren't just makeshifts but truly hold a place of permanence in the lives of our families, friends and neighbors in the city, and in our unique state. Jackson is changing. Mississippi is changing. New developments like the Fertile Grounds project, new flags like the Stennis flag, and new people like myself are taking root here and cultivating culture for today and tomorrow.

78,"Aug 6, 2019",Honolulu Civil Beat,Why Trump's Stoking Of White Racial Resentment Makes Working-Class Americans Worse Off - Honolulu Civil Beat,"Many white men say they feel threatened by the increasing presence and success of minorities in the workplace.

As social scientists, we wondered if there is any evidence to support this perceived economic threat, a perception that can provide fertile ground for current rounds of racist and xenophobic political messaging.

Our work at the Center for Employment Equity at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, involves using Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data to explore workplace discrimination and diversity in states and cities across the U.S. Our aim is to discover and promote more equitable workplaces.

In our most recent report, called “Race, States and the Mixed Fate of White Men,” we examined the connection between minority populations and the job prospects of white men in private-sector companies.

C-SPAN

White Male Privilege

Social scientists generally agree on three research findings about white men in the U.S. and the notion that they are losing their unearned but expected racial privileges.

First, white men at every education level are more likely than women and non-Asian minorities to get access to higher-wage jobs.

Second, while wages of average working-class people in the U.S. have stagnated in recent decades, and economic insecurity has grown, earnings for middle- and upper-class jobs – which are dominated by educated whites – have soared.

A third and more recent finding is that working-class white men are the group that is most racially resentful and most opposed to further immigration. This finding is based on analyses of survey data of the whole U.S. population examining both voting behavior and attitudes toward blacks and immigrants, zeroing in on President Donald Trump’s core supporters and the content of his political messaging to them.

This resentment probably explains why working-class whites, particularly men, are so receptive to President Trump’s anti-immigrant and racist messages – and why he targets them.

We suspected that the reception to racist and xenophobic messages might be a reflection of a growing competition between working-class whites and minority men for increasingly insecure, low-wage jobs.

White Men Dominate The Executive Suite

In our study, we compared different racial groups’ share of specific occupations with their percentage of their state’s workforce. In other words, we wanted to see how over- or underrepresented white, black and Hispanic men were in various jobs.

In general, we found that while some white men are prospering in executive and managerial roles, there is another group of white men with very different employment experiences.

At the top end of the labor market, our data showed that in every state, white men were overrepresented in executive and managerial jobs. But this white male privilege varied substantially by state. White men got even more of the top jobs in states with larger minority populations.

Texas, where minorities make up a third of the labor force and white men slightly more at 37%, was the most extreme. White men held 85% of private-sector executive jobs, making them overrepresented in top jobs by 138%.

Other states with sizable minority populations, such as California, New Mexico and Mississippi, similarly showed white men are especially advantaged in their control of the executive suite.

We found the same, if less extreme, pattern of white male advantage in private-sector management jobs.

Working-Class Competition

The pattern shifts dramatically, however, when we look at lower-paid working-class jobs.

These include machine and factory operatives, manual laborers and service occupations. Such jobs typically require high school degrees or less and tend to pay low wages. We find that more than half of these jobs pay below the living wage target of $15 per hour.

In every state, black men were overrepresented as machine operatives, manual laborers and service workers. Hispanic men were overrepresented in machine operative and manual labor jobs in every state except Hawaii.

Working-class overrepresentation for minority men tends to be higher in states with small minority populations, such as Vermont, Maine and North Dakota.

But we wanted to get more directly at the degree to which working-class white men are competing for the same low-wage jobs as minority men. So we compared the number of black, Hispanic, Native American and Native Hawaiian men performing operative, laborer or service jobs versus white men. In all states except Hawaii, these minorities are mostly black or Hispanic or both.

We found that in almost all states, working-class white men were competing for jobs with relatively large groups of minority men. And in 20, there were more minority men in these working-class jobs than white men. This pattern was most extreme in Washington, D.C., and California, where there were more than three minority men in these jobs for every white man.

Improving Working-Class Lives

This does not mean that working-class whites have lost their entire racial advantage, but rather that it is more tenuous and exists in a context of wage stagnation and increased insecurity.

Research shows that many whites attribute being stuck in low-wage, insecure jobs to competition with minorities but are unaware of the larger trends of wage stagnation and growing insecurity for all working-class jobs.

So it is perhaps not surprising that this combination of visible competition and misplaced blame creates fertile conditions for stoking racial and immigrant resentment, particularly at a time of stagnating incomes, falling unionization and a growing lack of job security – problems that have done the most harm to the working class, regardless of race or national origin.

Perhaps it is politically simpler to encourage workers to see each other as rivals, but policy solutions that will actually make a difference need to focus on shared economic security – rather than blame games.

79,"May 15, 2020",The Atlantic,The People Who Profited Off the Trail of Tears,"In Unworthy Republic, Claudio Saunt, a historian at the University of Georgia, offers a damning synthesis of the federal betrayals, mass deportations, and exterminatory violence that defined the 1830s. Two of his principal arguments—that mass expulsion wasn’t inevitable and that it was a “turning point for indigenous peoples and for the United States”—are largely accepted among scholars. His third, that it was administratively “unprecedented” in American history, invites debate about longer histories of dispossession. But Saunt’s greatest contribution is to weld the narrative of deportation to new histories of capitalism that emphasize slavery’s centrality to national economic development: He follows the money, exhaustively researching company correspondence and government records to show how bankers in Boston and London financed the dirty work of dispossession in collaboration with southern speculators. The result is a haunting story of racialized cruelty and greed, which came to define a pivotal period in U.S. and indigenous history alike.

It is also a story of how—despite all the money that white people stood to make—expulsion almost didn’t happen, thanks to a storm of protest from indigenous people and the white allies they activated. And after it unfolded, the consequences lingered. As Saunt persuasively observes, we have yet to reckon with them today.

The mass deportations of the 1830s superseded an earlier federal policy of cultural assimilation and piecemeal expansion. Beginning in the 1790s, U.S. officials spread throughout eastern North America and pressured the continent’s longtime residents to change their ways: to wear pantaloons, use plows, pray to Jesus. The policy was paternalistic and pernicious, a tool of empire. But Native people strategically played along, adopting the customs of “civilization”—such as missionary schools and writing—that could help them exert their authority. Sometimes Natives and newcomers, the white families lurching in by the wagonload as the century turned, coexisted. Choctaw were “pretty good neighbors,” recalled a federal official who was grateful to share their food and buy their farm labor for a “very reasonable wage.”

Through the mid-1820s, U.S. politicians hailed this “civilization policy” as a self-evident success. Indigenous people were adapting, while the United States won partial and patchy land cessions, a process accelerated by the War of 1812. From 1800 to 1820, the United States wrested 600,000 square miles from its indigenous neighbors.

But Native Americans still controlled millions of acres east of the Mississippi, particularly in the South. In the 1820s, Creek Indians owned a fifth of present-day Alabama; Choctaw and Chickasaw, half of Mississippi. They farmed some of the world’s blackest, most fertile soil, the kind that might convert men into millionaires—especially if cultivated intensively, by workers under the lash. In fact, wealthy indigenous southerners already owned several thousand enslaved black people.","His third, that it was administratively “unprecedented” in American history, invites debate about longer histories of dispossession.

Sinatra.

Chuck Wepner (for at least one night in 1975 and then through the “Rocky” avatar).

At least some of the people that rest stops on the New Jersey Turnpike are named after.

These public figures are, or were, world-famous, and certainly had made a name for themselves outside of the Garden State, even if their growth as artists, authors, sports figures or icons was at some point nurtured in the fertile ground of the third state to enter the union. But, if either Springsteen or Sinatra, for example, wished to protect their image on the world stage or before a national audience, neither could invoke, directly or effectively, federal or international law.

That is because the right of publicity is not something protected by federal trademark or copyright law, or by compact or treaty. As Professor McCarthy has been noted (by Ahmad and Swain) to have stated, “’The right of publicity is not a kind of trademark. It is not just a species of copyright. And it is not just another kind of privacy right. It is none of these things, although it bears some family resemblance to all three.’” The right of publicity is one of those strange legal rights that depends on the law of one state or one country even if the facts used to vindicate one’s rights to publicity (or, as it is known in some places outside the United States, celebrity) are national or international in scope. The “right of publicity is a creature of state law, and its violation gives rise to a cause of action for the commercial tort of unfair competition.” ETW Corp. v. Jireh Pub., Inc., 332 F.3d 915, 928 (6th Cir. 2003). In an age where fame is often created, claimed and credited on a world wide web, one must ask whether it makes sense to define the legal rights associated with celebrity by such local standards.

One of the early US cases recognizing by name “the right of publicity” was in fact a New Jersey federal court case, Estate of Presley v. Russen, 513 F. Supp. 1339 (DNJ 1981). That case defined the right thus:

…The right of publicity is a concept which has evolved from the common law of privacy and its tort “of the appropriation, for the defendant’s benefit or advantages, of the plaintiff’s name or likeness.” The term “right of publicity” has since come to signify the right of an individual, especially a public figure or a celebrity, to control the commercial value and exploitation of his name and picture or likeness and to prevent others from unfairly appropriating this value for their commercial benefit… Although the courts in New Jersey have not [before 1981] used the term “right of publicity,” they have recognized and supported an individual’s right to prevent the unauthorized, commercial appropriation of his name or likeness.”

In fact, in so holding, the Russen court relied on a 1907 case involving Thomas Edison, Edison v. Edison Polyform Mfg. Co., 73 N.J.Eq. 136, 67 A. 392 (1907). As Professor McCarthy has noted, the law thus recognizes “the inherent right of every human being to control the commercial use of his or her identity.” So one might think that the right, well entrenched in New Jersey, is equally clear elsewhere, or everywhere, in the United States.

Think again. Though recognized in many states, the extent to which each recognizes the right of publicity is not entirely clear. For instance, in Arizona, a federal court has said it sees no reason why such a right would not be recognized, yet no state court has done so, and the state has a statute that protects the right of publicity of soldiers, without mention of civilians. Likewise, in Illinois and in Massachusetts, the common law right has been eliminated, and the right is now protected by a statute with a list of exceptions. States like North Carolina have rejected a right of publicity statute, and does not seem to recognize it at common law, according to the International Trademark Association’s 2019 survey. Fourteen other states do not, according to the same 2019 survey, recognize the right of publicity: Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont and Wyoming. And these starker disparities do not begin to capture the nuance of how standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction among the states that do recognize such claims. As one commentator has noted, “While courts in some states, such as New York, have narrowly interpreted right of publicity claims, other states have defined the rights more broadly. Decisions vary on which state’s law will apply to a publicity claim, which in turn is decided based on the particular state’s conflict of law analysis. Any analysis of a particular claim or publication should consider the specific state law that will be applied.” So it seems, at least as to a claim enforcing the right to publicity, the New York notion that “If I can make it there/I’ll make it anywhere” does not necessarily apply because there are some places that you cannot claim at all.

The variations are only more pronounced in the international arena. For instance, though the right exists in Israel, it has been noted that Israeli law in this area is unclear, both as to nature of any such right or its theoretical foundations. Likewise, despite constitutional rights to privacy and personhood, “[i]n India, there are neither adequate case laws, nor statute governing celebrity rights per se. Thus, the legal system in India, at present, is quite deficient in dealing with the modern phenomena of endorsement advertising,” according to previously noted commentators. And, though an Indian right to publicity may exist for Indian citizens, “some jurisdictions like India, deny the right of publicity to non-citizens.” The same commentators noted that United Kingdom, spurred during the pre-Brexit period to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and rulings of the court in Strasbourg, had seemed poised to gravitate toward greater recognition of publicity rights, but it is unclear where that will now go. But UK law must be confused because another commentator has starkly stated that “[t]he United Kingdom does not recognize the right of publicity,” and the International Trademark Association has also said that the right of publicity is not recognized in England and Wales “but there are a number of other legal rights which could be used to achieve a similar effect.” (Though not mentioned in the Survey, it appears that Italy too protects publicity by overlapping other rights, as noted in World Trademark Review. But what is clear is that certainly “There is no unanimous approach to the right of publicity in the countries of the EU,” as Kateryna Moskalenko notes) It has also been noted that Canada’s approach to the right of publicity is “the closest system to the United States because the Canadian provinces differ in protection offered and scope” of that right just like the separate states in the US. Further, the International Trademark Association’s 2019 survey notes that though “[t]he right of publicity is not recognized in Australia,” the right does exist, in one form or another, in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and the UAE. The survey, though helpful, only covers sixteen countries plus the fifty United States, leaving the status of the law on what it means to be world famous a little under-reported as to the other 179 countries in the world, where it may or may not exist, or may be under consideration as it had been in the Ukraine.

Given the amount of publicity these rights sometimes get, we thought perhaps international agreements may have dealt with the right to celebrity. Noting that we had in the past provided some food for thought on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), we looked first to that document to note that it does not address that right in any material way (TRIPS does not refer to publicity, celebrity or fame), though Amad and Swain try to imply otherwise. As outlined in the same article, other treaties, like the Rome Convention and the WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty, offer various protection of performers’ rights, but do not protect the right of publicity itself. This in fact excludes the right of publicity from important enforcement principles under international law:

Most importantly, the right of publicity is not mentioned in any international treaty by the WTO such as The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPs”). Thus, nations are not required to offer protection to foreign citizens. The fundamental principle of the WTO is to encourage trade without discrimination, this is known as the national treatment principle. Under this principle, nations must provide the same level of protection offered to their citizens to foreign individuals (citizens from nations signatory of the WTO). Unlike other forms of Intellectual Property, the right of publicity remains excluded from this principle. *** There is no unifying body of international law on the right of publicity. Unlike the intellectual property right of trademark, copyright and patent law, there is no international treaty or convention to address the right of publicity. Every jurisdiction treats the right of publicity differently. Thus, depending on the geographical location in which an individual resides, there are different levels of protection offered.” [Eliana Torres, The Celebrity Behind the Brand International Protection of the Right of Publicity, 6 Pace. Intell. Prop. Sports & Ent. L.F. 116 (2016)].

This situation therefore suggests that a uniform right to enforce publicity rights should be recognized in a statute embodied in TRIPS, according to Torres. But even if international recognition and uniformity is unlikely to be soon achieved, might not a US national standard be within reach? (Some of asserted that even the fragmented US standard is preferable to not recognizing the right at all, as in the UK). Certainly in an age where the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (or at least some version of it) has been adopted by 48 states and there is a federal act, the Defend Trade Secrets Act, as well, the notion of nationalizing this standard is not without precedent or purpose. As my friend Bruce Keller has noted, “considering that the technological advancements that spawn new communicative endeavors also create a strong desire to organize such endeavors within a comprehensive legislative framework,” the lack of US national or international protection of the right of publicity in any uniform way “at first seems odd.” As Keller also notes, “[o]n reflection, however,” gap filling by common law “is understandable” because “statutes have a way of lagging behind real life.”

In many ways though, it now seems time to get it in gear and make up that lag. While noting in the past that the US can be “slow to Berne,” as it were, on such international matters, some movement makes sense, whether with a federal act or a proposed uniform act for state-by-state adoption. Torres provides a good starting point on substance of such an act:

Protection of The Right of Publicity: Persona and Image Rights

In respect of the use of an individuals’ likeness for commercial use without prior consent from the individual or the individual’s successor-in-interest, the individual shall have the possibility to prevent such use of his or her persona or image. Infringement shall occur when the individual’s image or persona is used for a commercial purpose without authorization and from such use the individual is ‘readily identifiable’ when one who views the image with the naked eye can reasonably determine that it is such natural person depicted in the image. Rights in Persona and Image shall last for the lifetime of the Registrant plus a period of fifty (50) years after the death of the Registrant. Rights in Persona and Image vest in the right-holder regardless of whether such rights were commercially exploited during that individual’s lifetime by either that individual or a licensee or assignee and shall be deemed exclusive to the individual, or licensee or assignee of such rights, for the full duration of such rights as protected under this statute. The individual rights provided for in this statute are considered property rights and are freely assignable and licensable. After the death of any individual, the rights under this statute shall belong to the successor-in-interest. [Any jurisdiction adopting these provisions] shall provide limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the Persona or Image and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right-holder, such as fair use and newsworthiness.

Ideas worthy of consideration.

But, until then, we have our common law, which may always remain “more adaptable” since, as Keller explains, a “court presented with a novel set of facts can review prior case law, analyze new factual situations, and, reasoning from past precedent, apply existing legal principles to fashion a new rule governing the heretofore unanticipated set of facts facing the court.” The sets of facts around celebrity and publicity are, at this point though, no longer unanticipated, and setting a broadly applicable statutory standard makes sense.

As for being famous by New Jersey, or other states’ standards, for the time being, it will have to suffice. Which is ok, because as the Boss said when inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, we know how to stick up for ourselves, and being from New Jersey, as we pursue our fame:

is not our curse. It is our blessing. or this is what imbues us with our fighting spirit. That we may salute the world forever with the Jersey state bird, and that the fumes from our great northern industrial area to the ocean breezes of Cape May fill us with the raw hunger, the naked ambition and the desire not just to do our best, but to stick it in your face. Theory of relativity anybody? How about some electric light with your day? Or maybe a spin to the moon and back? And that is why our fellow Americans in the other 49 states know, when the announcer says “and now in this corner, from New Jersey….” they better keep their hands up and their heads down, because when that bell rings, we’re coming out swinging. God Bless the Garden State.”

And when Einstein, Edison, Aldrin, Springsteen himself, or their heirs need a little help with the legal stuff connected to protecting their fame, they will hopefully remember to express some gratitude to those of us urging such protections. As Bruce said in his Rock N Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, “Now the lawyers — gotta thank them.”","Likewise, in Illinois and in Massachusetts, the common law right has been eliminated, and the right is now protected by a statute with a list of exceptions.
Decisions vary on which state’s law will apply to a publicity claim, which in turn is decided based on the particular state’s conflict of law analysis.
*** There is no unifying body of international law on the right of publicity.

Story Highlights Program, similar to one started after Hurricane Katrina, launched in 2014.

Animals sent from areas with a lot of strays to areas where there is a large demand for rescues.

Apple and about two dozen other dogs made the trip from Mississippi to New York.

Two weeks after being rescued from the streets of Starkville, Mississippi, Apple arrived in New York City on Thursday as the 100,000th homeless animal relocated by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

About 100 people cheered as a relocation van arrived in Manhattan. Apple rode north in a crate with Curry, a Chihuahua mix that was with her when she was found in Mississippi.

Apple is cute and workers doubt the brown, short-haired mutt with hints of a black mask will spend much time in her temporary home at an adoption center before finding a permanent home.

“Apple isn’t going to be around very long,” said Laura Nelson, director of relocation outreach for the nonprofit organization.

Similar to a program that rounded up and moved homeless animals after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, the relocation effort began in 2014. It sends animals from areas with lots of strays or unwanted animals to areas where there’s a large demand for rescue animals but a small supply.

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

In the West, the organization said, animals are typically relocated from Southern California to the Northwest; animals from Texas are sent as far north as the Great Lakes. A large number of animals come from the South, a fertile breeding ground for strays because of the verdant landscape and warm temperatures.

Since many communities in places like Mississippi and Alabama lack funding for programs to spay or neuter lots of animals, the relocation program frequently moves animals from there to places including New York and New England, where stray populations aren’t as large but demand for animals is huge.

Holding Apple in her lap, board member Michele Anderson of the Oktibbeha County Humane Society in Mississippi said the transportation program saves the lives of animals that otherwise could wind up being euthanized.

“Until aggressive spay and neuter programs actually make a dent in reducing the large number of unwanted and neglected animals in our community, animal relocation is the only life-saving option for many of our animals,” Anderson said.

ASPCA said 2018 was the program’s busiest year yet, moving 29,360 dogs, 10,610 cats and 344 other animals across the country to make them eligible for adoption.

Apple and about two dozen other dogs made the 1,100-mile (1,770-kilometer) trip from Mississippi to New York over two days with an overnight stop in Virginia. They rode in a truck with a cargo area that includes individual crates, a climate control system and video monitoring.

Trisha Deaton, who has been driving a relocation truck for about a year, said the trips seem like an endless cycle, with so many homeless animals in some places and so much demand for animals in others.

“I couldn’t give you an exact number, but I normally do about two a week,” she said.

After a health check in New York, Apple and the 16 other dogs in her shipment will be put up for adoption. Any of them could get new names as they move to homes with new families, and that’s fine with the workers and volunteers at the Mississippi shelter.

“We hope they get adopted quickly,” Anderson said.

83,"Jul 22, 2019",Washington Post,The surprising history served with a plate of biscuits and gravy,"The indulgent meal, beloved by people from all walks of life, is now ingrained in the fabric of America’s breakfast and brunch culture. But its origins were decidedly modest.

Biscuits and gravy in some form may go back as early as the Revolutionary War, but many food writers and culinary historians position its birthplace in Southern Appalachia in the late 1800s. Lumber was one of the main industries of the region, which supports the origin story that sausage gravy was also called sawmill gravy. It was the ideal cheap and calorie-dense fuel for sawmill workers lifting heavy logs all day long, and the perfect tool for making the era’s biscuits more palatable.

America’s first biscuits were much sturdier than today’s delicate specimens. Called “beaten biscuits,” they got their leavening and smooth texture from being vigorously beaten and folded, according to John Egerton in “Southern Food: At Home, On the Road, In History.” Making beaten biscuits was often the duty of enslaved cooks or domestic servants and could take well over an hour. Once the free labor was no longer technically allowed via the ratification of the 13th Amendment, the process “had come to be viewed as too burdensome,” Egerton writes. A machine invented in 1877 “not only saved beaten biscuits from extinction but actually made them smoother, prettier, and more popular than before.”

Around the same time, baking powder and soda became commercially available. Combine this with the increased availability of flour, and the South became fertile ground for a new version of the biscuit to take root, giving cornbread a run for its money as the reigning quick bread of the region.

Why did sausage gravy become their de facto companion? It was a simple matter of economics. “Biscuits with ‘country’ or ‘white’ gravy scratched together from sausage, pan drippings, flour, and milk were affordably made from the foodstuffs that were in low supply after the American Revolutionary War,” writes Heather Arndt Anderson in “Breakfast: A History.”

When it entered the culinary canon, biscuits and gravy was for the poor, working class. “Pork was always the protein of the poor,” Arndt Anderson said in an email. “Sausage releases so much fat when cooked that a roux comes together easily in the drippings.”

Yet for some, such as my own grandmother, even sausage and dairy were out of reach at times.

Born in 1928 in tiny Rondo, Ark., my grandmother and her family lived on a farm among fields of cotton and other crops. As customary for many farmers, their livelihood oscillated with the success of each harvest, resulting in either “fat” or “lean” times, as she put it. Regardless of where they found themselves on the pendulum of prosperity, biscuits were almost always on the breakfast table.

In a family of about 10, “Being the oldest daughter, it was my plight to get up and make biscuits if Mama didn’t do it,” she tells me. She would form a well in a mound of flour, baking powder and salt and add liquid to form a dough, which she kneaded, rolled out, cut and baked into the morning’s rations. Depending largely on if they had a cow that recently birthed a calf (or a generous neighbor willing to share), the liquid was either milk or water.

“It was a treat for us to have biscuits with syrup and butter,” she said. The syrup came from the sorghum on their land, and the butter depended on the availability of dairy and the time of the year. “Southern women made such an issue about baking cakes for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, they’d save the butter,” she says. In the good times, ham and occasionally rice would make an appearance. But during the lean times, breakfast consisted of just biscuits and “thick gravy” — water thickened by a brown roux of oil and flour. No sausage, and no cream.

As Sara Roahen and John T. Edge write in “The Southern Foodways Alliance Community Cookbook,” “The Southern way with gravies was born of privation. . . . And when folks are poor, folks make do. Which means folks make gravy.”

The South is home to many gravies, and virtually any of them could be served with biscuits. Appalachian food authority Ronni Lundi talks of chipped beef and gravy and tomato gravy in her cookbook “Victuals.” “The Southern Foodways Alliance Community Cookbook” includes recipes for Mississippi Chennai okra gravy, oyster gravy, Roan Mountain corn gravy, and, in what sounds like a Wonka-esque child’s fantasy, chocolate gravy.

Nicole Taylor, executive food editor at Thrillist, recalls first experiencing biscuits and gravy in her hometown of Athens, Ga., at the now-closed Katherine’s Kitchen, where her mother worked. “Biscuits were a treat,” Taylor says, and she ate them with ham steak and red-eye gravy, traditionally made from ham drippings and coffee.

Erika Council, esteemed biscuit queen and granddaughter of famous North Carolina restaurateur Mildred “Mama Dip” Council, on the other hand, says the gravy she ate with biscuits was of the sausage variety. (“North Carolina, home of Neese sausage,” she says.) Biscuits and gravy has been served over the years at her family’s revered Chapel Hill restaurant and is one of the best-selling items at her biscuit pop-ups in Atlanta. “The sausage gravy [is] . . . definitely requested often when we cater,” she says.

Though biscuits and gravy started out as a humble regional dish, its presence has spread far and wide. In addition to human migration, the invention of refrigerated tube biscuits in 1930 made biscuits and gravy easier to prepare at home. Eventually, the dish even took root on restaurant menus as far away as the Pacific Northwest. “As a staple of the poor, biscuits and gravy would never have appeared on fancy restaurant or hotel menus in Portland’s past,” Arndt Anderson wrote in an article for PDX Monthly. “By the early 1980s, though, seemingly out of nowhere, spots around town began casually advertising the B&G, as though it had always held the same breakfast menu real estate as bacon and eggs.”

AD

AD

Cookbooks soon followed suit. In “Southern Food,” published in 1987, Egerton writes about country gravy that “It is rare to find in any cookbook a recipe for this quite common and popular companion to hot biscuits,” but that is now no longer the case. “The Joy of Cooking,” which I view as the chronicle of American cooking, included a recipe in its 2006 edition.

Today, you can find it just about anywhere. With the handle @biscuits___and___gravy, George Drake Jr. has even dedicated an Instagram account to his encounters with the dish. (His favorite is from Loveless Cafe in Nashville.) “It has such a tradition, and you can have as much fun with it as you want,” said Drake, a freelance radio producer in Dayton, Ohio. That means biscuits and lamb gravy at the Greek Street Dayton food truck; fried chicken, bacon and cheese on a biscuit topped with gravy from Pine State Biscuits in Portland, Ore.; and a dish called Fantasy Island at Leo’s Diner in Omaha. The latter includes hash browns topped with biscuits and gravy, two eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, green pepper, onion and tomato. Vegetarian and vegan versions abound, too.

Like lobster in years gone by or the chopped cheese sandwich more recently, biscuits and gravy has seen a rebranding, crossing geographic and cultural boundaries.

Asked why the dish has achieved such celebrity status among its fellow breakfast options, Drake has a theory: “I think it just appeals to so many people,” he says. “Way more than just pancakes.”

84,"Oct 29, 2020",E&E News,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: Graves of enslaved people pose hurdle for La. chemical plant,"A lifelong resident of St. James Parish, Sharon Lavigne spent her childhood playing in and exploring the fields that surrounded her home.

The Louisiana community was rich in flora and fauna — foxes, rabbits and deer made frequent appearances — and contained enough fish, shrimp and fertile soil for her family to catch and grow their own food.

These days, Lavigne's yard is filled not with wildlife and gardens but with a string of signs protesting the newest industrial plant slated for her neighborhood: the $9.4 billion Sunshine Project, named for the bridge that spans the Mississippi River to connect the western and eastern halves of the parish.

""Fighting this facility and all these facilities is an everyday job,"" said Lavigne, who leads the faith-based environmental advocacy group RISE St. James.

""I can't rest,"" she said. ""I can't sleep.""

Lavigne lives along an 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known as ""Cancer Alley,"" a region dotted with industrial complexes that spew air pollutants such as chloroprene, a likely carcinogen, into predominantly Black communities along the waterway.

EPA data shows that residents of the region face elevated risk of cancer due to air toxics exposure. Lavigne, for one, discovered that she had autoimmune hepatitis and aluminum in her blood.

The diagnoses got her thinking about Formosa Plastics Group's planned Sunshine Project.

Formosa's complex — which would produce ingredients for products like car casings, drainage pipes and N-95 masks — would add one more facility in ""Cancer Alley"" at a time when the country is already grappling with COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus that is exacerbated by exposure to air pollution.

The virus poses a particular threat for people of color, who are more likely to have preexisting conditions and to live in polluted communities.

""Before it even gets started,"" Lavigne said of the Formosa complex, ""we need to stop it.""

Announced in 2018, the 2,400-acre project is now subject to two lawsuits backed by RISE and other groups.

The challengers oppose siting the facility smack dab in the middle of a community where Black residents are struggling to protect not only their health amid the coronavirus pandemic but also their connection to their enslaved ancestors who are believed to be buried on the Formosa site.

They have already notched some early courtroom victories.

This summer, community members gained access to the Formosa property for a ceremony on Juneteenth, the day that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865. They marked the day on a burial ground located on the site.

A month later, Formosa wrote in a settlement agreement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it would postpone some building on the site before Feb. 1, 2021. The company said last week that it now plans to hold off on construction of parts of its complex due to the pandemic (Greenwire, Oct. 21).

At the time the Formosa facility was announced, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, touted the project's potential to bring 1,200 permanent jobs to the region.

""For more than 50 years, the Sunshine Bridge has connected the River Parishes in a strategic fashion that has enabled tremendous industrial growth and thousands of new jobs along both sides of the Mississippi River in Louisiana,"" Edwards said in a 2018 statement. ""The new Sunshine Project continues that bridge into a brighter economic future for Louisiana.""

Edwards' office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Formosa's Louisiana division is working with local officials to advertise openings and train local residents ""to be in a position to complete for jobs"" with an average salary of $84,500, said Janile Parks, director of community and government relations for FG LA LLC.

""FG is committed to hiring locally,"" Parks wrote in an email, which noted that the firm held an open house in 2018 to answer questions and discuss concerns. Parks also cited the company's community development initiatives.

But the promise of jobs has lost its luster for community members who have lost friends and family to cancer. Moreover, they said, when a new plant comes, the most desirable positions tend to go to out-of-towners.

""Jobs come after a person's life,"" Lavigne said. ""We pray that God will give us jobs that won't threaten people's lives.""

She added: ""God has the last say-so, baby.""

'Evidence of a crime'

Located on the site of the Formosa complex is a fenced-off area that — to the untrained eye — appears to be just another stretch of the sugar cane plantation that formerly sat on the property.

A closer look might reveal a mound or a pile of brush marking a thatch of ground, beneath which lie the remains of the enslaved people who once worked in those fields.

Those unmarked burial sites on the Formosa property are a key element of community members' fight against the complex.

""If you're focused on physical geography and landmarks, you wouldn't necessarily say, oh, that looks significant or that's like a historic building,"" said Justin Kray, a cartographer who has been working with RISE, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade and other Formosa opponents.

""There's a whole shift in preservation communities, which has been critiqued for focusing on, 'Does a building look pretty?'"" he continued. ""We're looking at preserving communities and social heritage and places that are important.""

Parks of Formosa's Louisiana division said the company has been working to protect remains found on one location, known as the Buena Vista site. She said no evidence of burials was found at a second location, known as the Acadia site.

""It is important to note that despite assertions made by outside groups about ancestral ties to the site, no archaeologist has been able to confirm the identity, ethnicity or race of the remains discovered on FG property,"" Parks said.

A report released this year by the firm Coastal Environments Inc. indicates that the Formosa site could hold as many as seven unmarked cemeteries.

Kray said it is ""quite likely"" that the property holds the remains of more than just enslaved people, but the absence of more information on who is buried is exactly the point: Slavery and pervasive racism that has devalued Black individuals have erased family histories and obscured ancestral ties.

An unmarked grave is emblematic of the oppression, Kray said.

""This is essentially the evidence of a crime in the past,"" he said.

St. James resident Gail Leboeuf said she considers all the people buried on the plantations her ancestors.

""We're fighting to keep all our relatives' final resting place a hallowed ground,"" she said. ""And we're fighting for people on top of the ground to have decent lives and not have this particulate matter contaminating our lives and COVID hunting us down.""

Environmental justice in the courts

Filing a successful environmental justice lawsuit is no simple undertaking, but Julie Teel Simmonds said she is up for the challenge.

The Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney is part of the legal team behind a D.C. district court lawsuit that targets an Army Corps of Engineers permit allowing Formosa to carry out dredge-and-fill activities for the Sunshine Project.

Simmonds and her co-counsel are anchoring their environmental justice claims in the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.

""We have laws that look so noble and well-designed,"" Simmonds said. ""And yet whole communities can fall through the cracks.""

She said this summer's demonstrations over police brutality against Black men and women after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have put even more of a spotlight on the Formosa litigation and environmental justice.

""I don't think it's been on America's radar as much as it needs to be,"" Simmonds said.

Some state and federal officials are starting to take notice. For example, New Jersey last month enacted a law that requires state regulators to reject or condition permits based on disparate impact to communities of color.

""There is a clear trend of states taking environmental justice more seriously,"" said Beveridge & Diamond PC principal Julius Redd, who focuses his practice on how to help companies avoid the sort of litigation Formosa now faces.

While Louisiana has no such law in place, federal lawmakers have floated legislation to pave the way for stronger environmental justice challenges, and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has shown interest in underscoring those efforts if he takes the White House.

""Savvy businesses are making preparations anticipating that,"" Redd said. ""Many are seeing it as an opportunity to revise certain policies and procedures to more thoroughly consider environmental justice issues.""

The legal battle is just one element of the fight by RISE and other groups against Formosa.

The groups have organized marches to draw attention to inequities in ""Cancer Alley.""

For one demonstration in Louisiana, Simmonds drove from her home in Colorado to deliver nurdles — pea-sized microplastic pellets that a facility owned by Formosa Plastics Corp. spilled into Texas waterways, earning the company a record $50 million penalty (Greenwire, Oct. 16, 2019).

""It won't just be about the legal claims,"" said Simmonds. ""It's also going to be about the political efforts and public perception about plastics.""

'A Plan Without People'

Their fight doesn't stop with the Formosa complex.

St. James is subject to a 2014 land use plan that slates existing residential areas in the parish's 4th and 5th districts for future industrial activity.

""If changes are not made, the St. James Parish Land Use Plan will bring massive industrial pollution to the entire parish and eliminate two of the three majority African American districts in St. James Parish within the next decade,"" according to the report ""A Plan Without People"" that Kray co-wrote with Louisiana Bucket Brigade Director Anne Rolfes.

Delays to the Formosa plant construction have offered St. James residents some glimmers of hope.

Barbara Washington, a founding member of the new advocacy group Inclusive, recalled the community's success in pushing out a proposed $1.25 billion plant by the Chinese firm Wanhua Chemical. Citing rising construction costs, the company last year pulled its application to build a 250-acre complex.

Washington said she's not completely opposed to industrial development.

""What I'm against is the fact that industry is located too close to residential areas,"" she said.

St. James resident Myrtle Felton said she mostly stays inside these days because when she stands in her yard for too long, she comes back inside and coughs, and her sinuses act up.

Felton, who is also a member of Inclusive, said that in 2014, she lost five members of her family — including her husband — in the span of three months. The grandmother of four said the air quality in her community, not to mention COVID-19, has her concerned for her own health.

She said she would like to see her grandkids reach adulthood.

""We don't need any more chemical plants,"" Felton said. ""We don't even need the ones we have.""","St. James resident Gail Leboeuf said she considers all the people buried on the plantations her ancestors.

This list is just a morsel to suggest the banquet, omitting much more than it includes.

On Aug. 29, 1920, a child was born in Kansas City to a woman named Addie Parker. This mid-continent boomtown stank of money, literally — its stockyards in the Missouri River bottoms were among the busiest on earth. The Ford Motor Co. plant — the first outside Detroit — cranked out Model Ts for a car-crazy country. Prohibition was just a rumor from some far-off land. A local cartoonist named Walt Disney was fiddling with an idea called animation. A war veteran and sometime farmer, Harry S. Truman, was running a menswear shop downtown.

Addie’s boy was called Charlie. He was musically inclined, and for that he was in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. When he was a toddler, one of the first commercial radio stations in the United States went on the air in Kansas City. In search of content, WDAF began broadcasting dance music from a local hotel. In those days of uncluttered airwaves, the house combo could be heard across the country. Named for its co-founders, the Coon-Sanders Orchestra was dubbed “the band that made radio famous.”

That marked Kansas City as a music mecca. But the real talent was found closer to Charlie’s own neighborhood, along the glittering Black broadway of Vine Street, in the dance halls where jazz could be heard nightly. Bandleaders such as Andy Kirk, Benny Moten and Oran “Hot Lips” Page developed a riffing style that swung hard and free, and after the dancing stopped, the drinking kept going to fuel jam sessions that went until dawn.

As a teenager, Charlie Parker began taking his alto saxophone to those jam sessions, where he met and played with some of the great pioneers. By then, pianist William “Count” Basie, a veteran of both Page’s Oklahoma City Blue Devils and the Benny Moten Orchestra, had formed his own band and hired Mississippi-born Lester Young to anchor his sax line on tenor. Kansas City was crawling with strong sax players, including the dean of tenor players, Coleman Hawkins (from St. Joseph, Mo.), and the lush and breathy Ben Webster (a local kid). But it was the former Blue Devils alto player Buster Smith, a natural teacher, who mentored Charlie Parker’s preternatural talent through those all-night jams.

You could say that Kansas City’s Charlie Parker didn’t become the Immortal Charlie Parker — the genius known as Bird — until he left for New York City as a young man. Featured in a band lead by Earl “Fatha” Hines, Parker dazzled his Harlem contemporaries with his lightning-fast fingerings and innovative chords, the building blocks of the jazz style that came to be known as “bebop.” Although Parker’s frequent collaborator, trumpet virtuoso John “Dizzy” Gillespie, would eventually insist that this was “the same basic music” jazz artists had been playing all along, bebop struck like a lightning bolt. Bird’s impact was seismic; he split the history of America’s music in two.

But New York needed Bird at least as much as Bird needed New York. By that I mean a vital cultural capital requires a constant infusion of new ideas, and those are found most readily from outside. Cut off from the world, sealed unto its smug self, a mecca of culture inevitably stultifies, perpetuating the status quo by rewarding those who court its approval.

Today, the country runs that risk. Our artists and intellectuals tend to live in a few places and to circulate among themselves. Their worldview is, like the famous New Yorker magazine cover, limited to New York or Boston or Hollywood or Silicon Valley, with the rest of America an empty unknown. To the extent that the rest of the United States accepts this forlorn identity and retreats into populist resentment, we reinforce the alienation.

86,"Nov 3, 2020",IFLScience,Twitter Thread Explains How Events Millions Of Years Ago Influence US Elections Today,"A map of the US during the Cretaceous period. Ron Blakey, Colorado Plateau Geosystems/Gates et al., 2012, PLOS ONE CC BY 1.0 , Latif Nasser/Twitter

It may have escaped your notice, but today is rather important. As well as being World Sandwich Day and the 114th anniversary of the day SOS officially became the world standard distress signal, it's also the US election.

Whichever side of the partisan line you fall on, there's a fascinating thread on Twitter by Latif Nasser that is well worth your time, outlining how events during the Cretaceous period may still influence US elections today. How, you might reasonably ask? It all has to do with millions of tiny plankton and a blue streak in a sea of red.

-

In the southern states, you may have noticed that election maps tend to show it as quite, quite red, as they continue to vote Republican. However, if you zoom in closer, you'll notice a blue streak taking in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, where Republicans cannot seem to win.

-

This blue streak had gone largely unnoticed, or at least unanalyzed, until 2000, when Professor Emeritus of Geoscience and Natural and Applied Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Steve Dutch, took a closer look and noticed it aligned weirdly well with shorelines in Cretaceous maps of mainland North America.

-

-

So how could this ancient coastline possibly affect the elections taking place 66 million years later? Well, it ended up affecting modern demographics of the Southern states due to, you've probably guessed it, their history of slavery.

-

""During the Cretaceous, 139-65 million years ago, shallow seas covered much of the southern United States. These tropical waters were productive–giving rise to tiny marine plankton with carbonate skeletons which overtime accumulated into massive chalk formations,"" Steve Dutch explained in a piece for Deep Sea News back in 2012. ""The chalk, both alkaline and porous, lead to fertile and well-drained soils in a band, mirroring that ancient coastline and stretching across the now much drier South.""

The soil in this thin stretch of land became much darker and richer than soil in the surrounding regions, and the area becomes known as the ""Black Belt"". Here's where slavery comes in.

-

“The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers,"" advisor to several US presidents Booker T. Washington wrote in his autobiography Up From Slavery. ""Later and especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white.”

-

-

As for why the line only turns blue after the 1970s, Nasser writes that it was to do with voter intimidation and other prohibitive practices that kept African-Americans from voting. Despite it being illegal to deny votes to men on the grounds of “race, color or previous condition of servitude"" since 1870, and women since 1920.

""Authorities made it virtually impossible: poll taxes, literacy tests,"" Nasser explained. ""Even a pulley system that raised the ballot box out of reach of anyone not White. Not to mention intimidation and lynching.""

That began to change after the hard-fought-for Voting Rights Act signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.

-

-

-

From around the 1970s onwards, maps have shown that blue swoosh. But, Nasser warns, that's not the end of the story.

88,"Aug 25, 2020",Washingtonian,Stuart Stevens Is the Biggest GOP Defector Yet—and Very Different From His Pals in the Lincoln Project,"Why do liberals so guiltlessly throng to the Never Trump movement? In poring over the latest tell-all memoir, or inhaling all those ads from The Lincoln Project, one could wager that Democrats have voluntarily consumed more Republican talking points in 2020 than their entire adult lives. The reason is simple, of course: It’s exceedingly fun to watch the other side get needled. And when it comes to needling, no one does it better than the anti-Trumpers, who are piping straight into the Republican auditory cortex like Hanoi Hannah on the Mekong Delta.

The bipartisan appeal of the Never-Trump message comes from its simple principle: Trump is a perversion of the Republican Party. “Mr. Trump and his enablers have abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles,” wrote the leaders of The Lincoln Project in their founding declamation. Accordingly, this view has taken on a De Gaullian air, touting the return of the party in exile. The real Republican party is catalogued by its achievements—building highways, favoring immigrants, founding the EPA. On the other hand, Trumpers aren’t Republicans at all, but engaged in a sort of hostile occupation.

Yet by casting Trump this way—as a perversion of their ideals—the Never-Trumpers have cleaved the world neatly in half. In their tableau, there are Resisters, and there are Imposters: a war between adversarial tribes, which represent the only two kinds of Republicans left on earth.

In fact, there’s a third kind of Republican: His name is Stuart Stevens. Regarded as one of the party’s most talented political gurus—a body of work that includes steering Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012—Stevens may arguably be the Republican Party’s most prominent defector. Stevens despises Trump. He works for the Lincoln Project, too. But that is where Stevens parts company with the Never-Trump movement, and in exceptional ways.

While the Lincoln Project argues that Trump is perverting the Republican Party, Stevens doesn’t think Trump has perverted anything: Trump is the Republican Party, Stevens believes, and the Republican Party is Trump. He thinks that there is no reclaiming his former party—and thus no inspiring appeals for better angels left to bother with. Reflecting on a four-decade career in American politics, Stevens has become convinced that Trump was not an aberrant zigzag. He was fate. “I saw a lot of this stuff, but I just chose to believe that this kind of dark side was the recessive gene, not the dominant one,” he says. “I was wrong.”

Stevens has indexed this argument in a new memoir-cum-confession, out this month, with a title that accurately conveys its morose contents: It Was All a Lie.

As a memoir, It Was All a Lie is unlike anything published in the Trump era: a photo negative of the genre of self-justifying apparatchiks, which propelled writers like Cliff Sims, Anonymous and John Bolton onto the bestseller lists. Stevens isn’t out to convince readers of his heroism or the soundness of Republican principles. He’s written a history of the modern GOP from an insider’s perspective, as well as something deeply personal, often self-flagellating. It bears less resemblance with any Trump tome, and more with Thomas De Quincey’s “Confessions of an English Opium-Eater”—a memoir launched by adulations of youth and conquest, before its descent into gothic horror and pitch-black nightmares force a reckoning on its exhausted author, who must take an accounting of a long, bleak life.

In this case, Stevens’ drug of choice was winning—something he was exceedingly good at—before he watched the party transform into something that repelled him.

Stevens is disconsolate. “None of it meant anything…It was all a lie,” he writes—on page one. Page two: “It is a strange, melancholy feeling to turn sixty-five and realize that what you have spent a good portion of your life working for and toward was not only meritless but also destructive.” Then, on page three: “I refused to believe what Donald Trump proved about Republicans, about myself, could be true.” By page 4, you’re hoping someone will take Stevens’ shoelaces away.

When I called Stevens, I found him alone in the woods of Stowe, Vermont, and seemingly dying to speak to someone. He called the book a work of “sadness and self-reflection,” something he was compelled to write.

“I feel like I’m watching a friend drink themselves to death, and I don’t know what to do about it,” he said, as he described watching the candidates he’d gotten elected suddenly capitulate to Trump. His tone wasn’t the pedagogy of a teetotaler, but the profound guilt of the friend who supplied the bottle. “I was part of it! I was in the middle of it all,” he said, repeating a theme of his book. “I bear as much responsibility as anybody else.”

The book is structured as a survey of the conservative values he thinks were betrayed, from free trade to foreign policy. In that sense, it’s a typical summary of Reagan conservatism. But Stevens’ opening chapter gives pride of place to a topic rarely afforded much ink by conservative strategists: Race, which his chapter calls “the Original Republican Sin.”

Whatever denial and self-deceit that culminated with Trump begins here, Stevens argues. On his first campaign in 1978, he was taught how to divide and diminish the Black vote. His assessment of past Republican presidents is more or less unsparing, writing, “There is a direct line from the more genteel prejudice of Ronald Reagan to the white nationalism of Donald Trump.” He’s unsparing of himself, too, reflecting on how ads for Mitt Romney in 2012, which criticized the Obama administration’s welfare policy, should have triggered alarm bells. He calls the GOP “the de facto White Party of America.”

In some respects, Stevens is the opposite of a country club Republican. He grew up near Jackson, Mississippi, raised by racially liberal parents who were active in the Civil Rights movement. While he was busy climbing the ranks of Republican politics, in his private life Stevens cut a reputation as a thrill-seeking bon vivant—traveling the globe to race competitively in ski marathons and bicycle races, sampling all the Michelin restaurants of Europe, and writing several travel books and TV scripts. One profile in 2012, during his management of the Romney campaign, concluded that Stevens “doesn’t even regard matters of life and death as life-or-death,” much less campaigns—which he instead regards “as an exhilarating form of sport.”

How the dauntless sportsman turned into a crestfallen mope is the subtext of Stevens’ memoir. It largely begins with Romney’s defeat. That loss infamously prompted Republicans to write the so-called autopsy report: a dire warning that the GOP needed fundamental changes if it wished to remain competitive, which would require attracting a multi-racial and multi-generational coalition of voters. Beginning in 2015, however, Donald Trump began doing pretty much the exact opposite—prompting commentators to suggest that Trump had proved the worthlessness of the autopsy. Perhaps he had showed his shrewdness for victory, too, however cold-blooded, thus casting Romney as a feckless loser.

But Stevens thinks the autopsy report has been misunderstood: It wasn’t strictly a strategic document at all, he argues, but an ethical one. “It was written not only as a political necessity, but a moral imperative,” he said. “It said, if you’re going to be entitled to govern the greatest country on earth—this big, cacophonous, loud, noisy country—you need to be more like that, and represent it.”

But Trump did win, and once he did, “it was almost like this audible sigh of relief” for Republicans, says Stevens, who now “could take the autopsy and throw it out the window.” The new strategy doubled-down on the party’s predominantly white base, just as Trump did—scratching out a victory in 2016 with 46.1 percent of the vote (although getting a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Romney did in his loss, as Stevens likes to point out).

On the phone, Stevens’ commentary was shot through with confessional diatribes, turning a political gab fest into something that felt more like a therapy session. “I was drawn to politics because of campaigns—not because I thought there was some higher, greater good to be served by government,” he sighed, as he described his guilt for the fifth or sixth time. “I thought that was normal. I never wrestled with the totality of the consequence of it. And in retrospective, I should have.” He paused for some time. “That was a mistake.”

But a good therapist challenges their patient’s persistent negative thoughts. Was it really all a lie? Did truly none of it matter?

Stevens was adamant. “The Republican Party is against everything I thought it was for,” he said, ticking through a list: The importance of character, personal responsibility, free trade, strength against Russia, pro-legal immigration. In his view, the party had reversed on all of them. “Now we’re the anti-character-counts party. I mean, actively—that’s the official position,” he said. “We have a president… who from the White House defends a woman at the center of an international child rape ring, and wishes here well. ‘So what?’” He laughed bitterly. “With Ronald Reagan, we said words could help bring down the Berlin Wall. Now we’re like, ‘It’s just words.’”

He compared the GOP to OPEC. “The Republican party, what does it stand for? I have no idea,” he said. “It’s a cartel. Nobody asks OPEC, ‘What’s the moral purpose of OPEC?’ It’s to sell oil. What’s the moral purpose of the Republican Party? It’s to elect Republicans.” He called it “a syndicate, not an association of political beliefs.”

In at least one respect, Stevens has been vindicated. This summer, for the first time in history, the Republican Party chose not to adopt an official party platform—the complex, meticulous language that traditionally forms the two parties’ governing ideologies. Perhaps they thought a rancorous policy squabble would be a costly indulgence during a pandemic. But many see an indication that conservative politics have gone the way of Louis IX: The leader is the platform.

At the bottom of Stevens’ argument, however, isn’t how wayward his party has gone—or how lost he feels from it—but whether the Romney wing can ever surge back. He sees some hope in a small brood of East Coast governors whom Stevens helped get elected: Phil Scott in Vermont, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, and Larry Hogan, the outspoken governor of Maryland. But he doesn’t see them sailing far against the headwinds of Trump. “If that was the case, we’d see it—we’d see great clamor for a Larry Hogan to run [for president], or a Charlie Baker,” he said. “We don’t see that.”

Whereas The Lincoln Project tells of a bright future around the corner, Stevens is despondent. The party will continue to win races, of course. For a longer foreshadow of the party’s prospects, however, and especially for the presidency, Stevens looks to California—where the GOP routinely doesn’t finish second, but often third. “I think that’s the future,” he said.

“There is a market for a center-right party,” he continued, adding that “eventually, some coherent Phoenix will rise.” But not before the party can completely dispense with Trumpism, he says. And Stevens thinks that’s a long way off.

Stevens’ pessimism isn’t the only thing distinguishing him from his Never-Trump counterparts: The once-top strategist in Republican politics now says he’s a Democrat. He means this more as a spiritual designation, rather than a change of registration, and much less ratifying a progressive worldview. Still, the implications are not lost on him. “I think you have to be involved in the system in a way, which means you have to be a Republican or a Democrat. So, my decision is, I’ll support Democratic candidates,” he explained. “Until I don’t.”

Odd as it sounded, it was better than the alternative. “It seems like I’ve spent enough of my life living in a fantasy world of politics,” he told me. “I don’t mean to continue that.”

89,"Jul 12, 2019",Engineering News-Record,"Kaskaskia, an Illinois Island Community in the Mississippi River, Still Can't Assess Flood Damages","After three months of being submerged in flood waters, some bridges and roads are finally passable in the tiny island town of Kaskaskia, Ill., on the Mississippi River. But local officials still don't have a good idea of how much damage has been done.

As record rain fell this spring, Illinois' first capital was cut off from its neighbors in Missouri and the rest of Illinois by up to 45 ft. of water It was only in the first week of July when the roughly three dozen residents of Kaskasia, which has no stores or schools, could cross the river in their vehicles. All of Kaskaskia's bridges were underwater from April until early July and heavy rains destroyed the crops grown on the fertile island ground.

""The tops of our bridges look good,"" says Derek Klein, a commissioner in the Kaskaskia drainage and levee district. ""The water has gotten down to 35.5 ft, which is better than where we were but it really needs to get down below 30 ft for us to be able to get a good look. We'll see what happens when it gets down there.""

Klein says it would be nearly impossible to add more height to the levees that surround Kaskaskia because fill material is not readily available. Protections put in place after 1993 flooding submerged the whole island were effective this year in keeping homes and historic sites dry.

""We actually did really well at holding the water down,"" Klein says. ""We got more rain this time, over a longer period, than in '93, but our levees held, our pumps worked, we added some berms and reinforced some areas that were a problem.""

Klein said markings on the island's pumps showed the height of the water this year was lower than that of 1993, which he attributes to the new protections. The Illinois State Climatologist Office says parts of Southern Illinois have received 200 to 300% of what it considers normal rainfall this year.

Kaskaskia has been separated from the rest of the state since the Mississippi meandered around it in the 1880s. The Liberty Bell of the West, donated by Louis XV in 1741, is still at a historic site on Kaskaskia even after the capital moved to Vandalia and then Springfield.

Its population has steadily declined. The 2010 census counted 14 residents in the farming community. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker (D) has declared a state of emergency for 36 counties and Randolph, of which Kaskaskia is a part, is among them. Klein says the levee and drainage district has yet to receive any relief funds from federal or state agencies. He is planning to attend a flood relief meeting next week.

The Illinois Constitution of 1870 authorized the Illinois General Assembly, the state's bicameral legislature, to pass laws giving landowners drainage rights. Drainage and levee districts are local bodies formed for the purpose of draining, ditching, and improving land for agricultural and sanitary purposes. They are authorized to build and maintain drains and levees, to sue all necessary private land within their corporate bodies for that purpose, and to tax land within their boundaries as necessary.","After three months of being submerged in flood waters, some bridges and roads are finally passable in the tiny island town of Kaskaskia, Ill., on the Mississippi River.

90,"Jul 31, 2020",Facing South,Black farmers markets bring greater equity to the South's food system,"On a recent Sunday in July, a line of over 100 people social distancing and wearing masks in the muggy North Carolina heat stretched around the block waiting to get into the downtown Durham Black Farmers Market. Families with toddlers, grandparents, huddles of teens, and young adults showed up to buy fresh food and explore a new kind of farmers market. The event promoting Black farmers and Black-owned businesses in North Carolina was organized by Black August in the Park, a local group that connects people of African descent to engage in social and cultural change.

Back in 2015, Black August in the Park began hosting a family reunion-style event of the same name to build community in Durham. The organizers — Moses Ochola, Crystal Taylor, and JaNell Henry — heard from Black business owners looking for a place to sell their goods, so that same year they launched the Black Market. The Black farmers who got involved became that event's biggest fans, and the organizers soon realized how much farmers in particular needed help.

So in 2018, Black August in the Park organized the first Black Farmers Market in Durham as an annual event — one of the first of its kind in the South. This June they expanded to twice-monthly one-day events alternating between Durham and nearby Raleigh that have attracted up to 1,500 customers a day.

The Black Farmers Markets are working to ""redesign the food system,"" says co-organizer Moses Ochola, who helps his parents, Caren and Maurice Ochola, run their popular Palace International African restaurant in downtown Durham. Through community and commerce, he and the other organizers hope to give Black farmers — dramatically underrepresented in traditional farmers markets — a space that celebrates them.

While Black farmers have been selling their produce directly to customers as long as they've been farming, farmers markets explicitly devoted to Black farmers and vendors under the title ""Black Farmers Market"" first appeared in news reports in the early 1990s in Chicago, according to an archive search by Facing South. The first was organized in July 1990 by Rev. Al Sampson, who worked with Black farmers in North Carolina and other Southern states to bring what he called ""soul food"" to be sold in the city, according to the Chicago Tribune. A similar model was established in Baltimore in 1996, also importing produce from the South, and others sprouted up in Indianapolis and Oakland, California. The first Black farmers market in the South was held in Atlanta in 1997. Since then, there have been a handful of others in Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.

""Black farmers have systematically been left out of a lot of programs and initiatives to help them, and have been losing their land at a tremendous and alarming rate,"" says Ochola. The Black Farmers Market is an attempt to ""bring them back into the fold … so that we can not only help the farmers but help rethink food sovereignty in our Black communities.""

Resisting dispossession

In 1920, Black farmers in the U.S. owned 41.4 million acres of land. But since then, white-supremacist terrorism and systematic racism by banks and government institutions like the Farm Security Administration and USDA have worked together to dispossess Black families of their land. Over the past century, Black people in the U.S. have collectively experienced a loss of 90% of the farmland they once owned.

""We need to understand that the entire agricultural system in the U.S. is built on the exploitation of Black and brown people,"" says Erin White of the Community Food Lab, a group based in Raleigh, North Carolina, that works to design a more equitable food system. Due to consumers' disengagement from the food system, he adds, ""we are allowing other interests to build the food system that works for them, and we end up with a food system that doesn't support human health, doesn't support racial equity, doesn't support sustainable land use, or climate responsibility.""

Black organizers in the South have long focused on the food system as a path to economic freedom for the Black community. In 1969, for example, the Mississippi voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer started the Freedom Farm Cooperative that purchased prime Delta land and grew cash crops like soybeans and cotton to pay taxes and administrative expenses, and vegetables that were distributed back to co-op members who included Black agricultural workers fired from other jobs because of their civil rights activism. Around the same time, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund based in Georgia began working to keep Black farmers on their land through collective ownership. And in 1995, the National Black Farmers Association was formed in Virginia to advocate for the rights of Black farmers; it played a key role in winning a $2 billion settlement in the class action lawsuit Pigford v. Glickman that alleged racial discrimination by the USDA in providing loans and other assistance.

But as White observes, the recent movement in the U.S. to promote healthier and more sustainable eating by supporting local farmers markets among other things was overwhelmingly white. So though there has been a boom in farmers markets in recent years — they grew by 76% from 2008 to 2014, and another 6% since then, according to the USDA — they typically serve affluent white populations and too often have erected barriers that discourage farmers and other vendors of color.

The Community Food Lab is conducting a comprehensive survey to dig deeper into issues around racial equity in North Carolina farmers markets. But based on initial responses, at least a quarter of the state's markets report having no vendors of color at all, White says. Getting into a farmers market can be a competitive and expensive process, and once someone is accepted there are often rules that make it hard to stay.

""When they have restrictions on what they can sell, what they can't sell, and things of that nature, it makes it hard for farmers that don't have all the resources and opportunities that white farmers have,"" says co-organizer Crystal Taylor of Black August in the Park and the Black Farmers Market.

White-dominated markets can also be a flat-out unwelcoming space for black vendors. ""I mean, it's a traditional setting, you know, is a nice way to put it,"" says Samantha Foxx of Mother's Finest Urban Farms in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""I've had people who come by me, and I'm like, 'Hey, how are you doing?' And they don't even look my way. Even if we have the best things to offer, they don't even want to consider what we have."" Foxx now tries to use her presence to change these markets, but showing up was not always easy. ""I felt like they pushed us out,"" she says.

One prominent farmers market recently faced public criticism for its treatment of Black farmers. Freshfarm, the farmers market system in Washington, D.C., came under fire after promoting Black vendors in their network in response to the police killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed. One of those vendors, Toyin Alli of the food booth Puddin', spoke up about how her experiences did not align with the organization's claims of being anti-racist. She told Forbes she had been repeatedly denied a spot in its most profitable market at Dupont Circle with no justification, and she said Black vendors account for just a tiny fraction of all vendors within Freshfarm's network. In response to Alli's advocacy, the organization added more Black vendors.

The organizers of the Durham Black Farmers Market say their work is all about building networks and connections to Black farmers — especially since the intentional outreach needed to create true equity in traditional farmers markets isn't happening.

""We've realized that Black farmers are not being tapped,"" says Ochola. ""So, much of our work is communicating and trying to get farmers to be a part of it.""

'Something I could call my own'

The Durham Black Farmers Market is just the latest innovation in a rich and growing ecosystem of food-justice organizations and projects in North Carolina's Triangle region, long a center of cutting-edge scholarship around agriculture given that N.C. State, the public land-grant research university known for its agriculture programs, is located in the capital city of Raleigh.

The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) — a partnership of N.C. State; N.C. A&T, a historically Black university in Greensboro; and the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services — is one of the South's most important centers for research and education in sustainable agriculture and community-based food systems. CEFS has worked with the Community Food Lab and other local groups on an initiative to connect downtown neighborhoods through food.

Raleigh is home to the vast North Carolina State Farmers Market, which is open seven days a week. But even before the Black Farmers Market began serving the city, there were other smaller farmers markets taking place there. One is operated by the Fertile Ground Food Cooperative, which is planning to open a brick-and-mortar store in the historically Black community of Southeast Raleigh, where some neighborhoods have been designated so-called ""food deserts"" where quality food is hard to come by. In the meantime, the co-op launched a regular farmers market in 2016.

Janet Howard, Fertile Ground's project manager, sees a benefit to farmers markets beyond being a place to buy fresh, local food. ""It reinforces to our community and to young people that this is an opportunity for you to not only see and purchase, but consider agriculture,"" she says.

Such efforts appear to be paying off. After a century of decline, the number of Black farmers in the U.S. is growing again. The 2017 Census of Agriculture reported just over 32,000 Black farmers representing 1.6 percent of the nation's agricultural producers — double the share in 1997. Black-owned acreage was also up to 3.9 million acres compared to the low point of 2.3 million in 1992.

This new group of Black farmers include people like Kamal Bell. The former public school teacher founded Sankofa Farms in Orange County, North Carolina, not far from Durham, to help people affected by food deserts. The farm also provides educational opportunities for Durham youth. Bell said he had many visions for what the farm would be, but what ultimately led him to buy the land was simple.

""The first thing was just so I could have something I could call my own,"" Bell says. ""Because if I want to eat food, I'm not going to sit back and always go to white people for resources.""","Through community and commerce, he and the other organizers hope to give Black farmers — dramatically underrepresented in traditional farmers markets — a space that celebrates them.
Due to consumers' disengagement from the food system, he adds, ""we are allowing other interests to build the food system that works for them, and we end up with a food system that doesn't support human health, doesn't support racial equity, doesn't support sustainable land use, or climate responsibility.""

91,"Mar 7, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Doors to Vicksburg - The Vicksburg Post,"“T he story of Vicksburg is laced together by the river that birthed her,” writes Virginia Calohan Harrell in her book, “Vicksburg and the River.”

Located on top of a high bluff on the east bank of the Mississippi River, Vicksburg’s earliest settlers, even its founder the Rev. Newit Vick, came to the city by way of the river since roads were either nonexistent or impassable.

Although the area’s first inhabitants were the Native Americans, Harrell writes, others eventually arrived in the city of rolling hills and fertile soil.

Those who came included the French, Spanish, English, Scottish, Irish, Germans, Italians, Swiss, Jewish, Russians and Chinese.

The diversity expanded when African Americans were brought to Vicksburg.

Christopher Morris writes in his book, “Becoming Southern: The Evolution of a Way of Life Warren County and Vicksburg Mississippi, 1770-1860” that from 1775 to 1795, a steady stream of migrants from England’s Atlantic colonies made their way to the River City and brought with them their slaves.

This is us, a city that is a virtual melting pot of faces and cultures and traditions. And all this can be discovered behind the doors of a community that is smart, strong and spirited.

Even during the Civil War when the city endured a 47-day siege, the city’s residents remained proud and resilient.

Dubbed the Red Carpet City of the South, Vicksburg welcomes visitors and celebrates those who live here.

Martha Vick Home

The Martha Vick Home (c.1830) is located at 1300 Grove St. and was built by Vicksburg founder Newit Vick. Built in the Greek Revival style, the one-story façade was constructed for Martha Vick, one of Newit Vick’s 13 children. It is the last original Vick home remaining in Vicksburg.

Jewish Temple — Anshe Chesed congregation

Jews began arriving in Vicksburg before the town was even incorporated and by 1825 when the city was officially incorporated, the Jewish population numbered around 20 families. These early settlers, and those who followed, came mainly from the Germanic lands of central and Western Europe fleeing political and religious persecution and seeking new economic opportunities. Mostly peddlers by trade, Jewish merchants established themselves in Vicksburg, an area reminiscent of their homes along the Rhine, and contributed greatly to the area’s importance as a leading trading and commercial center on the Mississippi River. As their community grew, the Jews eventually formed the Anshe Chesed congregation and in 1870 dedicated their first synagogue, which was located on Cherry Street. A final wave of Jewish immigrants moved to Vicksburg in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and formed their own Orthodox congregation, but soon merged with the long-standing Anshe Chesed Reform congregation. The congregation decided to move in the late 1960s and built a smaller temple on Baldwin’s Ferry Road. The Anshe Chesed congregation is one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the state of Mississippi, and for more than 165 years, it has been at the center of Vicksburg’s Jewish community.

Old Court House Museum-Eva W. Davis Memorial

The museum is located at 1008 Cherry St. and was constructed by skilled slave labor between 1858 and 1860. It is Vicksburg’s most historic structure. The Court House played host to many famous guests and speakers including Jefferson Davis, Ulysses S. Grant, Booker T. Washington, Teddy Roosevelt and William McKinley. Today it houses many relics of the past including fine portraits, china, silver, antique furniture, antebellum clothing, Native American and pioneer implements, plus an original Teddy Bear.

Shirley House — Vicksburg National Military Park

The Shirley House was owned by James and Adeline Shirley and is the only wartime structure remaining inside the Vicksburg National Military Park. On May 18, 1863, as the Confederate rear guard fell back into the Vicksburg defenses, soldiers were ordered to burn all the houses in front of their works. The Shirley barns and outbuildings were quickly burned to the ground, but the soldier assigned to destroy the house was shot before he could apply the torch. The VNMP commemorates one of the most decisive Civil War battles, the campaign, siege, and defense of Vicksburg. In addition to the Shirley House, the park includes 1,325 historic monuments, 20 miles of reconstructed trenches and earthworks, a 16-mile tour road, 144 emplaced cannons, the restored Union gunboat-USS Cairo and the Vicksburg National Cemetery.

McRaven

McRaven is located at 1445 Harrison St. and the house spans three different time periods. Andrew Glass built the oldest section of the home, also referred to as the “pioneer section,” in 1797. Walls made from blueberry and buttermilk plaster still remain in the structure. Glass built the two-room brick structure with a bedroom above a kitchen. The home also had a removable ladder so Glass could get to the upper level and prevent an ambush while he slept. McRaven has been named Mississippi’s Most Haunted House and some think the hauntings began with Glass’ surprising death. He would rob people traveling the Natchez Trace and hide out in McRaven.

St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church

St. George was one of the first Orthodox churches in the southern part of the United States and has played an important role in the lives of many Orthodox faithful, including Lebanese, Syrian, Greek, Russian and Serbian nationalities.

St. George was established in 1906, and in 1910 purchased the old Gibson Memorial Church and transformed it into an Orthodox temple. In January 1967, the congregation moved into a newly constructed facility at 2709 Washington St. In 2006, the church celebrated its 100th anniversary. St. George is the oldest Antiochian Orthodox Church in Mississippi and the South.

U.S. Army Corps Of Engineers — ERDC

The Waterways Experiment Station, also known, as WES-Original Cantonment, is comprised of a 673-acre tract of land. The original complex was built in 1930 as a United States Army Corps of Engineers research facility. Its campus is the site of the headquarters of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers- Engineer Research and Development Center. WES is the largest of the four Corps of Engineers’ research and development laboratories. The facility was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2000 in part for its architecture. ERDC helps solve the nation’s most challenging problems in civil and military engineering, geospatial sciences, water resources, and environmental sciences for the Army, Department of Defense, civilian agencies, and the Nation’s public good. Its vision is to become the world’s premier public engineering and environmental sciences research and development organization.

Magnolia Avenue High School

Located on Bowman Street,Magnolia Avenue High School was at one time the only black secondary school in Vicksburg, and its curricular program balanced academics-college preparatory classes with a vocational course of study. In 1940, Magnolia Avenue was considered one of the 16 most important black high schools in the southeast, and was chosen to participate in a study funded by the Rockefeller Foundation’s Center.The school’s name was eventually changed to Bowman High school in honor of long-time principal J.G.H. Bowman.

Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum

In 1890, Joe Biedenharn and his father Herman built a two-story brick building at 1107 Washington St., which served as Joe’s wholesale candy company on one side and his father’s shoe store on the other. It was here that the Biedenharns bottled the first Coca-Cola until the new Coca-Cola plant was constructed at 2133 Washington St. in 1938.

Strand Theatre

Vicksburg once had as many as four downtown theaters, and among them was the Strand Theatre, located in the Adolph Rose Building, 717 Clay Street. A prominent local merchant, Adolph Rose, built the Victorian Romanesque building about 1890 for his goods company, and at the time it did not contain a theater. Around 1930, it was sold to Feld Furniture. The ground floor was renovated to house two long, thin commercial establishments, a store on the left and the theater on the right. The theater operated from 1932 to 1963, first as Paramount-Richards then Paramount-Gulf Theatres and finally by Gulf States Theatres. The Strand Theatre is now home to the Westside Theatre Foundation, which offers live theatre, films and concerts.

92,"Dec 7, 2020",vtdigger.org,"Daniel Felde: When the vaccine arrives, Vermont must prioritize incarcerated people","Share Email 294 Shares

Editor’s note: This commentary is by Daniel Felde, of Burlington, who is a senior at the University of Vermont studying political science.

With the first coronavirus vaccines set to arrive soon, Vermonters may be envisioning freedom. To some, freedom is a future of nightlife, dinner with friends, “normalcy.” To others, freedom is the promise of any future at all. As the vaccine is rolled out to the most vulnerable populations first, Vermont must prioritize the least free: people in prisons.

Throughout the U.S., prisons have been Covid hotspots. In fact, the five largest outbreaks in the country have been in prisons, not meatpacking plants or nursing homes. Three months ago, 185 (84%) of the 219 Vermonters incarcerated at a prison in Mississippi contracted Covid-19. A national study in August found that Vermont had the highest prison to state ratio of Covid cases out of any state. As the number of cases in Vermont surges, the 1,726 people detained and incarcerated by Vermont face an increasingly higher risk of contracting Covid. Once infected, the high rates of heart and lung conditions, mental illness, and substance use disorder among the prison population make the virus especially deadly. On average, the mortality rate is twice as high for people in prison than the general population after adjusting for sex, age, and race. Black people, who are at a heightened risk of both contracting and dying from Covid, constitute 9.5% of the prison population but only 1.4% of the state population. Vaccinating Vermonters in prison is therefore a major racial justice issue.

Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.

It is crucial that prioritizing incarcerated people includes Vermonters held in Mississippi. Vermont’s out-of-state contractor CoreCivic has not always been in lockstep with Vermont Department of Corrections policies. In April, the Vermont Prisoners’ Rights Office had to file a lawsuit against the DOC to push for additional Covid protection measures in the Mississippi facility. Keep in mind this was before the August outbreak. Clearly, it wasn’t enough.

The Vermont Department of Health will be looking to recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on how to identify priority groups to vaccinate. However, the ACIP prioritizes correctional officers (classified as essential workers), not incarcerated people in their phase I recommendations. If people experiencing incarceration are not included in the first phase of vaccinations, they may have to wait months for their turn.

It is no surprise that incarcerated people have been forgotten; prisons are institutions of societal amnesia and neglect. Once extracted from their communities, people incarcerated by Vermont have been sexually assaulted and denied medical care. Isolation in prison presents a dichotomy. Contact with outside family members and friends remains restricted: in-person visitations are off-limits and people are allowed two five-minute phone calls a week in addition to a weekly 25-minute video visitation. However, social contact within the prison is abundant, and shared living and eating spaces provide fertile ground for Covid to spread. The solution here is not months of increased social isolation, it is a vaccine.

If the Department of Corrections truly believes in the “inherent worth and dignity of all individuals,” it must fight for the vaccination of those it has incarcerated. If the Department of Health wants to pursue its mission to “protect and promote the best health for all Vermonters,” it must prioritize incarcerated people along with health care workers and those in long-term care facilities. Not only would this protect the health of incarcerated individuals but also, by preventing mass outbreaks, Vermont as a whole. If testing was the answer, then why won’t they simply be testing more in nursing homes during phase I? Because vaccines are the best technology we have to prevent the ravages of this virus. Our vaccination priorities show how we value life. I’m certainly looking forward to having my social circle vaccinated, but we must not forget people experiencing incarceration. They are parents, siblings, children, and friends too.","As the vaccine is rolled out to the most vulnerable populations first, Vermont must prioritize the least free: people in prisons.

93,"Jan 13, 2020",,‘The recruiting base here is hard to resist’: How Mike Leach will attack recruiting at Mississippi State,"STARKVILLE — The Pirate has arrived.

Following Friday’s introductory press conference — an over 35-minute session of laughs, offensive philosophies, and more laughs — Mike Leach has already made his mark on the MSU football program.

But with the opening pleasantries that come with a new coaching hire behind him, Leach’s immediate responsibilities involve filling out his coaching staff — something athletic director John Cohen has afforded him $4.7 million to do. But perhaps as pressing, it’s nearly time to turn the recruiting calendar toward the 2021 class.

For all the excitement Leach’s arrival has brought over the past four days — including the hopes of a high-flying passing attack led by quarterback Garrett Shrader, who was among the players that met the new head coach at George M. Bryan Airport Thursday — it remains to be seen how the former Washington State head coach will recruit in Starkville.

Speaking before a crowd of roughly 500 fans at the Leo Seal Jr. Football Complex Friday, Leach made note of how the recruiting base in Mississippi and the surrounding states was a major pull for the job.

“I’ve always wanted a quality place where people are committed to winning,” he said. “Just to be perfectly honest, the recruiting base here is hard to resist. A 300-mile radius of here just has outstanding recruits, and it all starts with the commitment on the high school level and the great job the high school coaches do here.”

Opening sentiments aside, Leach’s Washington State teams rarely, if-ever, recruited at an elite level. Over his eight seasons in Pullman, Leach never signed a recruiting class ranked higher than 42nd nationally in the 247 Sports Composite Rankings.

Further, only the 2018 class at Washington State included multiple four-star recruits (2), while the Cougars never signed three or more such prospects in a single year over that same span.

Conversely, Joe Moorhead signed three-straight top-25 classes during his two-plus year run at MSU — including the 22 recruits in the class of 2020 that inked with MSU during the Early Signing Period in December.

And while Leach has had limited recruiting success in the rankings, Mississippi’s fertile recruiting ground should provide a natural boost.

For context, 11 players from the Magnolia State rank in 247 Sports’ top 500 prospects for the class of 2020 compared to just seven players from the state of Washington. Additionally, eight of the top 20 prospects in Mississippi are committed or have signed with the Bulldogs, while Washington State’s 2020 class included just one of the top 20 players in the state.

“They’ve done a fine job recruiting here over the years,” Leach said. “There’s a lot of things we’re going to have to maintain and continue and then elevate as we see opportunities.”

Beyond the high school ranks, Mississippi also provides the added bonus of some of the nation’s highest rated junior college recruits — something Leach has already reaped the benefits of in the form of current Jacksonville Jaguar and former Northwest Mississippi Community College and Washington St. quarterback Gardner Minshew.

“I think that definitely helps and also a guy you like out of high school you have the ability to get him on track,” Leach said of the Mississippi junior college system. “I think the best teams — the majority come out of high school and I think it’s important for the core of your teams to be high school guys. But I’ve had some great luck with junior college guys.”

With Leach now focused on filling out his staff, he said Friday he expects to bring in recruiters familiar with the state and MSU’s recruiting footprint. Once on board, those staffers should quickly turn their attention to the 2021 class and the final few spots of the 2020 group. And though the 2021 class remains roughly a year from signing on to Leach’s squad, the new head coach is excited for his new staff to take advantage of the recruiting profile MSU affords.

“First and foremost, I want good, quality people who are dedicated recruiters and then a mixture,” Leach said of what he’ll look for in his recruiting staff. “We’ve got to have really strong guys who know X’s and O’s on the field, discipline, focus, and pulls the unit together. The most important thing is what you can do together.”","“Just to be perfectly honest, the recruiting base here is hard to resist.

94,"Mar 23, 2019",The Commercial Dispatch,Ask Rufus: Was Kubla Khan’s Sacred River the Tombigbee?,"Connections are always interesting. With the recent blooming of daffodils and jonquils I could not help but think of one of my favorite poems:

“I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o’er vales and hills

When all at once I saw a crowd

A host of golden daffodils

Beside the lake, beneath the trees

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.”

William Wordsworth wrote those lines in about 1804 and the poem “I wandered lonely as a Cloud” was first published in 1807. The May 4, 1839, New Yorker published the poem with an interesting twist: it credited “Louisa Ann Twamley” as the poet.

In an interesting local connection, the mid to late 1830s Mississippi agent for The New Yorker was Henry Gibson, whose address was given as Choctaw Agency, Mississippi. The Choctaw Agency at that time was southeast of present day Starkville. Gibson was John Pitchlynn’s son-in-law and had purchased the farm of Yo Ka Tubbe, a Choctaw who was living near present day Artesia. During the Creek Indian War of 1813-1814, Yo Ka Tubbe’s house had served as a safe house for the Pitchlynn children when Creek warriors threatened Pitchlynn’s fort at Plymouth Bluff.

When one thinks of famous poems with a Mississippi or Alabama connection, Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s classic poem “Kubla Khan” immediately comes to mind:

“In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

A stately pleasure-dome decree:

Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

Through caverns measureless to man

Down to a sunless sea.

So twice five miles of fertile ground

With walls and towers were girdled round;

And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,

Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;

And here were forests ancient as the hills,

Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.”

Few people realize that some of the landscapes, flowers and plants described in Coleridge’s masterpieces, “Kubla Khan” and “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” and in Wordsworth’s poem “Ruth” are actually places in Florida and the rivers and forests of the Mobile/Alabama/Tombigbee River valley.

That part of the story begins with William Bartram, who in March of 1773, began a four-year trek that would carry him across Georgia, through Florida and across present day Alabama and Mississippi to New Orleans. Of great interest to Bartram were limestone caverns and associated springs in Florida in which water rose up like a fountain and flowed into the St. Johns River and the flowers, plants, forest and rivers of what is central and south Alabama.

In 1791 Bartram published a book of his journey, “Travels Through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, Etc.” The book included vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape. It is still considered a classic account of the natural history of the early American South and is still in print, simply called “Bartram’s Travels.”

As Bartram traveled across the American Southeast he collected specimens and made drawing of the fauna and flora that he encountered. During his journey he described 358 plants and trees. He collected many specimens or made drawings of others which he sent to London. Today the Natural History division of the British Museum has 247 botanical specimens collected by Bartram during his travels.

Bartram’s book of his travels included descriptions and drawings of many plants, including the Oak Leaf Hydrangea which he discovered along the Alabama River. Of the plants described by him I recognized several that are still common in Mississippi and Alabama. Among those local flowers he described in the 1770s are the Primrose, Oak Leaf Hydrangea, Celestial Lily, Climbing Aster, Flaming Azalea, St John’s Wort, Hooded Pitcher Plant, Lupine, several Rhododendrons, Mountain Camellia, Purple Milkweed, Spider Lilly, Savannah Pink, Sebastian Bush, Pawpaw, Spider Flower, Yucca and Yaupon Holly.

He also described finding the Alabama/Mobile River valley landscape to be “a magnificent and pleasing sylvan landscape of primitive, uncultivated nature. Crossed several very considerable creeks, their serpentine courses being directed across the plain by gently swelling knolls perceptible at a distance but which seem to vanish and disappear as we come upon them.”

The renown British poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth obtained copies of “Bartram’s Travels” and became interested in the new country of America. Both pulled many images of the American Southeast from the book which they incorporated into their poems. This is especially evident throughout Coleridge’s masterpiece “Kubla Khan” which he was said to have written after reading Bartram’s book. In one example Bartram had described the lower Alabama/Tombigbee/Mobile river system as “a serpentine rivulet meandering over the meadows.” In “Kubla Khan” Coleridge wrote:

“Five miles meandering with a mazy motion

Through wood and dale the sacred river ran”

In another example Bartram had written: “The evening cool, we encamped on the banks of a glittering rivulet amid a spicy grove of Illicium Floridanum.” These spicy groves were found in “…detached groves, contrasted by swelling ridges and vales supporting grand forests of trees.” (The tree was the anise tree whose leaves have a sweet smell but whose flowers when ripe have a fishy odor. The tree is found along the Gulf Coastal Plain and within the Black Prairie.)

In Kubla Khan Coleridge wrote:

“Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;

And here were forests ancient as the hills,

Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.”

Such similarities with the book occur throughout the poem and in such number it would not be a coincidence. Who would have ever thought that many of the images in “Kubla Khan” and other masterpieces of British poetry are taken from descriptions of a 1770s journey from Florida across Alabama and Mississippi to New Orleans?","The May 4, 1839, New Yorker published the poem with an interesting twist: it credited “Louisa Ann Twamley” as the poet.

95,"Sep 25, 2020",American Songwriter,"Squirrel Nut Zippers Continues to Share Joy, Happiness on ‘Lost Songs of Doc Souchon’","Squirrel Nut Zippers leader Jimbo Mathus calls as he’s driving through Tupelo, Mississippi. “The whole region here is quite historic,” he says. Tupelo is, of course, where Elvis Presley was, born and lived in his childhood. For a musician, then, this area is fertile ground, and Mathus clearly appreciates that.

Mathus has been paying homage to his musical forerunners since he founded Squirrel Nut Zippers in 1993. The Zippers, as they’re affectionately nicknamed, are beloved for their fun-loving take on swing, jazz, and blues music. This pattern continues with their latest album, Lost Songs of Doc Souchon (set for release on September 25), which includes original Zippers material alongside covers of early New Orleans jazz songs. “I think the music will bring a lot of joy and happiness. That’s a huge component of what we do,” Mathus says.

The inspiration for this new album came to Mathus last year. “I did a residency in New Orleans for two months last spring and I played all the clubs. I’d had a revival band, they’re all New Orleans cats, and I wanted to go down there and just be with them and just immerse myself in their world.” While there, Mathus says, “I started thinking back to my Doc Souchon record – these songs that go way back yonder.”

Souchon, born in 1897, was a celebrated jazz guitarist. He was also, Mathus says, “a folklorist and early proponent of keeping the roots of New Orleans jazz alive. He made a boutique record back in the 1960s. He was quite old then. He grew up in the twenties, thirties, and saw and was enthused by the music, so he preserved this in this record. Very obscure.” From this starting point, Mathus says the concept for the next Zippers album started coming together.

Mathus learned how to play some of the songs on that Souchon record, such as “Cookie” (by New Orleans Willie Jackson) and “Animule Ball” (of unknown origination). Both of those tracks appear on Lost Songs of Doc Souchon, as well as several other early songs. Mathus kept that material in mind, “sort of template songs,” as he wrote three original tracks for the album.

Some of the material came from much earlier seeds of ideas, though. Mathus, who was raised in Mississippi, founded Squirrel Nut Zippers after moving to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1993. Around that time, he says, he recalls picking up religious tracts when he’d go to the laundromat. “They’re little pamphlets that Christian groups put out about the horrors of alcohol or the impending everlasting punishment of hell. They have little graphics on them, too, that can be quite surreal. One of the tracts stuck with me all these years: ‘Time’s passing like a train on fire, so you’d better get your house in order.’” From that, Mathus was able to write the song “Train on Fire.”

Mathus doesn’t mind taking this long to complete a song. “I’m very patient with my songs,” he says. “If I have a great idea and don’t have a great song, I’ll wait until it hits me. If it’s not coming naturally, I just leave it alone.”

Mathus admits that it wasn’t initially evident that he’d ever become a songwriter at all, though. He started out in a band that only played alternative music cover songs. When someone suggested he write his own material instead, “I thought, ‘Oh yeah, that’s how you get songs – you write them!’” But, not knowing how to proceed, he didn’t immediately act on this advice.

Finally, “One day, this song just overtook my imagination,” Mathus says. “I was driving out in the country and I didn’t know what was happening. I genuinely thought that maybe I was going insane. These thoughts were permeating my mind and these words were coming out. Very odd.” Mathus pulled into a gas station and borrowed a pen and some paper so he could scribble down what he was hearing in his head. “At that point, I knew, ‘That’s what writing a song is!’”

Mathus can’t remember much about that particular song now (“It’s not anything I ever recorded – it was so early on in the process”), but it was the catalyst he needed to start learning how to become a songwriter. As he worked, he realized that rock music was not what he actually wanted to do at all – he was far more interested in what had come before that.

“I started really understanding that everything comes from somewhere,” Mathus says. “Like, you can listen to something like the Rolling Stones – where did that come from? Well, that came from Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. Okay, where did that come from? So I started following the trail backwards, to understand what it was that songs were doing and where they came from.”

In the 1990s, at the peak of the grunge era, this was certainly an unusual approach to songwriting. Mathus formed Squirrel Nut Zippers to help him realize this unique vision, and they released their debut album, The Inevitable, in 1995, but it didn’t initially get much attention. By the time they released their second album, Hot, in 1996, the world was ready for their retro swing sound, and the album achieved platinum status. By 2000, they had put out three more releases, with three million album sales.

After their 2000 album, Bedlam Ballroom, the Zippers went on hiatus, and Mathus moved back to Mississippi and began a solo career, releasing numerous albums (available at his Bandcamp page: https://jimbomathus.bandcamp.com/). He also toured and recorded with Buddy Guy. He opened his own studio, where the likes of Elvis Costello recorded. But in 2013, realizing that interest in the Squirrel Nut Zippers was renewed because of the twentieth anniversary of their Hot album, he reformed the band and resumed playing shows. In 2018, they released the well-received album Beasts of Burgundy.

Mathus believes that the Squirrel Nut Zippers continue to interest people because “it’s just so unique, it’s so fun. To me, an entertainer needs to be exuberant. He needs to be outgoing. He needs to be fun. You can sit there and strum your song. That’s fine; people do that. But I wanted more of a spectacle. We’re not here to satisfy or gratify ourselves. We get gratified when we see the faces light up, when we see the joy, the manic dancing and frenzied conga lines. That makes me know, okay, I’m doing my job.”

And it’s a job that Mathus plans to do for the rest of his days. “It’s my life’s work: I’m a journeyman musician,” he says. “I’m not a flash-in-the-pan dude. I’m here for the long haul. I get a lot of inspiration for that from the jazz cats and blues guys that started early and performed their entire life – there’s no shelf life on that. That’s the cat I wanted to be. And that’s the cat I’ve turned into.”","Squirrel Nut Zippers leader Jimbo Mathus calls as he’s driving through Tupelo, Mississippi.
Mathus has been paying homage to his musical forerunners since he founded Squirrel Nut Zippers in 1993.
Very obscure.” From this starting point, Mathus says the concept for the next Zippers album started coming together.
Mathus, who was raised in Mississippi, founded Squirrel Nut Zippers after moving to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1993.
Mathus believes that the Squirrel Nut Zippers continue to interest people because “it’s just so unique, it’s so fun."

MSU Students Recognized for Gardening Project

Mississippi State University students studying landscape architecture, architecture and graphic design recently took part in a program to conceptualize a suite of garden designs aimed at helping schools build learning gardens.

The project, called ""The Living Room: A Freeware Learning Garden Focused on Health, Food and Nutrition Education,"" received an Honor Award for student collaboration at the American Society of Landscape Architects.

MSU's consortium included 10 landscape architecture students, 10 architecture students and one graphic design student. ASLA recognized the MSU students for their efforts at the society’s recent virtual conference. The project also appeared in “Design-Build: Integrating Craft, Service, and Research through Applied Academic Practice,” a textbook by University of Washington Landscape Architecture professor Daniel Winterbottom.

The MSU students produced two proof-of-concept designs, one of which is already in place at Galloway Elementary School in Jackson and another which is scheduled for installation at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU in spring 2021.

MSU's students collaborated on the gardens with The Fertile Ground Project, a Jackson-based program about food access; JH&H Architects in Flowood; Pikus Concrete in Utah and Significant Developments in Pennsylvania.

97,"Nov 28, 2018",Jackson Free Press,EDITOR'S NOTE: 'Tis the Season for Kindness,"One day, I was sitting at one of the computers at church when my friend walked over and handed me something.

""I saw this and thought of you,"" she said. It was a package with something that felt like it was made of metal.

I unwrapped it and found an orange and yellow lapel pin from designer Kate Gabrielle with the words ""Make America Kind Again"" written in '70s-esque letters with little white flowers surrounding it. It was cute, and very much my style.

When I wear it, it serves as a reminder, both for myself and anyone else who notices it, of the power of kindness. I will be the first to admit that ""make America kind again"" is a super hokey phrase, but it's a good reminder, and also so necessary right now when we're in the midst of a Senate race that's brought out the worst in some of our politicians (cough, cough, Cindy Hyde-Smith). Roll your eyes all you want, but we do need to make America, and Mississippi, kind again.

One of my favorite people to follow on social media is Bob Goff, a lawyer, honorary U.S. consul for Uganda and the founder of nonprofit Love Does, which does work in education and human rights in post-conflict countries. He's the kind of person who carries around balloons to give to people as a gesture of kindness. He wrote books such as ""Love Does"" and ""Everybody, Always,"" which I just finished reading.

In ""Everybody, Always,"" Goff talks about the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Bible. You probably know the story. This is an extremely abbreviated version, but a man who was traveling was attacked and abandoned on the side of the road. A priest and a Levite passed him by. It was a Samaritan, essentially an outcast in that time, who showed him mercy and took care of him.

Jesus used this parable to answer the question of ""Who is my neighbor?"" The answer? ""The one who showed him mercy.""

It's important to note here that the man on the side of the road was Jewish, and the one who saved him was Samaritan, who were the enemy of Jews back in that time period. Yet it was a Samaritan who showed the man mercy.

Goff uses this story to illustrate his point that everyone is our neighbor. The people who work in our offices and buildings, those who make the dreaded small talk in elevators. The people who go to your church. The people who serve your food or coffee (for the love of God, please tip them). City-council members. Mayors. Governors. Senators. Parents. Friends. Enemies. Frenemies. People of different races. Immigrants. People who love differently than you do or identify differently. In this great big world, we're all neighbors, and though we come from different backgrounds and paths of life, we all have one thing in common: We're human. We deserve kindness and love. All of us, no matter who we are or where we come from.

The day we go to press with this issue is Giving Tuesday, and my inbox is full of ways to give back, and if you did participate in giving back, good on you.

But it's not just about donating to a charity, though that's helpful for all these organizations that are trying to make a difference. It's also about doing nice things for people—doing the right thing. Showing them compassion and kindness, regardless of who they are. Psychology Today says one act of kindness can affect a person's physical and mental health. Compassion and kindness reduce stress, boost immune systems, and help decrease emotions like anger, anxiety and depression. And I'm sure every single one of us could probably use more good stuff and less negativity in our lives right now.

The holiday season gives us the perfect excuse to show a little more kindness toward other people. After all, it's in the nature of the holiday. At least I hope it is. And it doesn't even have to be a gift.

It could be simple things like holding the door for someone or participating in cleaning up a local area, or just talking to someone you don't know. It could even be something else simple like shopping local. When you shop at local businesses, you're literally helping your neighbor, many times directly. And then you're helping where you live because statistics show that if you spend $100 locally, roughly $68 of that goes back into the community. And you know what? Best of Jackson provides another great way to give back to local businesses. It's your chance each year to let those businesses know how you feel about them. The finalist ballot goes online on Dec. 5, so make sure you show local business and people lots of kindness.

Mississippi is being portrayed in a negative way, again, thanks to Hyde-Smith's comments. People like her would have the rest of the world believe that we're backward people who still believe that people of another race or economic background are beneath us. And sure, some people may believe that. But that's not the Mississippi I know. The Mississippi I know isn't perfect by any stretch of the imaginations. We still deal with ghosts of our past day in and day out, but many of us are fighting against that. We're fighting for things like people's right to marry who they want and for a woman's right to bodily autonomy.

We're a creative bunch, and the only thing that stops us from accomplishing our goals is ourselves. We literally and figuratively stand on fertile ground. Let's make something of ourselves and show our fellow people more kindness this holiday season.

98,"Jul 29, 2019",The Conversation US,Why Trump’s stoking of white racial resentment is effective – but makes all working-class Americans worse off,"Many white men say they feel threatened by the increasing presence and success of minorities in the workplace.

As social scientists, we wondered if there is any evidence to support this perceived economic threat, a perception that can provide fertile ground for current rounds of racist and xenophobic political messaging.

Our work at the Center for Employment Equity at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, involves using Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data to explore workplace discrimination and diversity in states and cities across the U.S. Our aim is to discover and promote more equitable workplaces.

In our most recent report, called “Race, States and the Mixed Fate of White Men,” we examined the connection between minority populations and the job prospects of white men in private-sector companies.

White male privilege

Social scientists generally agree on three research findings about white men in the U.S. and the notion that they are losing their unearned but expected racial privileges.

First, white men at every education level are more likely than women and non-Asian minorities to get access to higher-wage jobs.

Second, while wages of average working-class people in the U.S. have stagnated in recent decades, and economic insecurity has grown, earnings for middle- and upper-class jobs – which are dominated by educated whites – have soared.

A third and more recent finding is that working-class white men are the group that is most racially resentful and most opposed to further immigration. This finding is based on analyses of survey data of the whole U.S. population examining both voting behavior and attitudes toward blacks and immigrants, zeroing in on President Donald Trump’s core supporters and the content of his political messaging to them.

This resentment probably explains why working-class whites, particularly men, are so receptive to President Trump’s anti-immigrant and racist messages – and why he targets them.

We suspected that the reception to racist and xenophobic messages might be a reflection of a growing competition between working-class whites and minority men for increasingly insecure, low-wage jobs.

White men dominate the executive suite

In our study, we compared different racial groups’ share of specific occupations with their percentage of their state’s workforce. In other words, we wanted to see how over- or underrepresented white, black and Hispanic men were in various jobs.

In general, we found that while some white men are prospering in executive and managerial roles, there is another group of white men with very different employment experiences.

At the top end of the labor market, our data showed that in every state, white men were overrepresented in executive and managerial jobs. But this white male privilege varied substantially by state. White men got even more of the top jobs in states with larger minority populations.

Texas, where minorities make up a third of the labor force and white men slightly more at 37%, was the most extreme. White men held 85% of private-sector executive jobs, making them overrepresented in top jobs by 138%.

Other states with sizable minority populations, such as California, New Mexico and Mississippi, similarly showed white men are especially advantaged in their control of the executive suite.

We found the same, if less extreme, pattern of white male advantage in private-sector management jobs.

Working-class competition

The pattern shifts dramatically, however, when we look at lower-paid working-class jobs.

These include machine and factory operatives, manual laborers and service occupations. Such jobs typically require high school degrees or less and tend to pay low wages. We find that more than half of these jobs pay below the living wage target of US$15 per hour.

In every state, black men were overrepresented as machine operatives, manual laborers and service workers. Hispanic men were overrepresented in machine operative and manual labor jobs in every state except Hawaii.

Working-class overrepresentation for minority men tends to be higher in states with small minority populations, such as Vermont, Maine and North Dakota.

But we wanted to get more directly at the degree to which working-class white men are competing for the same low-wage jobs as minority men. So we compared the number of black, Hispanic, Native American and native Hawaiian men performing operative, laborer or service jobs versus white men. In all states except Hawaii, these minorities are mostly black or Hispanic or both.

We found that in almost all states, working-class white men were competing for jobs with relatively large groups of minority men. And in 20, there were more minority men in these working-class jobs than white men. This pattern was most extreme in Washington, D.C. and California, where there were more than three minority men in these jobs for every white man.

Improving working-class lives

This does not mean that working-class whites have lost their entire racial advantage, but rather that it is more tenuous and exists in a context of wage stagnation and increased insecurity.

Research shows that many whites attribute being stuck in low-wage, insecure jobs to competition with minorities but are unaware of the larger trends of wage stagnation and growing insecurity for all working-class jobs.

So it is perhaps not surprising that this combination of visible competition and misplaced blame creates fertile conditions for stoking racial and immigrant resentment, particularly at a time of stagnating incomes, falling unionization and a growing lack of job security – problems that have done the most harm to the working class, regardless of race or national origin.

Perhaps it is politically simpler to encourage workers to see each other as rivals, but policy solutions that will actually make a difference need to focus on shared economic security – rather than blame games.

The Mississippi Health Department is reporting the state now has 12 cases of new coronavirus, including new cases reported Monday for Monroe and Pearl River counties.

The Mississippi Health Department on Wednesday evening reported the state's first presumptive case of the novel coronavirus. .

As of 11 a.m. Monday, the state Health Department listed a total 12 cases and that 289 people have been tested. Also, a case previously reported as being in Pearl River County was from Hancock County, the department reported.

State of emergency declared

On Monday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced two executive orders that will activate the National Guard to keep health care workers safe at testing centers being set up across the state, send all non-essential state workers home, require schools to set up ""distance learning"" and continue to offer students free and reduced lunches.

Reeves said any state or local government employees that miss work due to the outbreak will receive paid leave.

He said he hopes that businesses will follow the state's example in sending employees home and offering them paid leave.

Reeves also announced the closing of Mississippi casinos.

The biggest risk is that coronavirus cases in Mississippi overwhelm the health care system. He urged people to wash their hands and practice good hygiene.

""Be smart, be safe. Because, the reality is, while you may be healthy, this is about protecting Mississippi's most vulnerable. Even if you are healthy you are still need to protect your friends and your neighbors,"" Reeves said.

Reeves stressed the seriousness of the crisis. He said the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency considers the virus a ""level one"" disaster, which hasn't been seen since Hurricane Katrina.

Over the weekend, Reeves declared a state of emergency for Mississippi.

Reeves warned Mississippians to avoid any large gatherings, including church services Sunday, and to ""use caution"" and not panic. Reeves also asked for Mississippi schools to close for at least a week. Most were on spring break last week. Dozens of school districts have announced additional closure plans, with some announcing closures of two weeks, including Madison and Rankin districts.

Meals provided

A metro area school district is providing lunches for area students despite being closed.

The Rankin County School District posted on social media Sunday night that it would be providing ""grab and go"" lunches for free for any child 18 and under. While the student must be present to get a lunch, they do not have to be a student in the Rankin County School District.

Starting Tuesday, the lunches will be handed out at three schools via a drive thru line with more locations expected to be added. Parents can also purchase a lunch for $3.50. First responders in uniform can pick up a lunch for free.

Lunches can be picked up from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at McLaurin Elementary, Richland Upper Elementary and Pelahatchie Elementary.

The school district announced Saturday that schools would be closed though Friday, March 127.

In a separate effort, volunteers are providing a drop-off meal service for Jackson families in need, the People’s Advocacy Institute announced. Several organizations are partnering to provide breakfast and dinner for families through schools’ extended breaks. Meal drop-off operations are being guided by healthcare professionals, the release said, and volunteers will minimize one-on-one contact and group gatherings.

Call or text (615) 946-4197 to set up a meal drop-off location and time. The mobile meal hotline is being monitored 24 hours a day, according to the release.

Clinic opens to treat, test symptomatic people

A new Cough and Fever Clinic opening Wednesday at Hattiesburg Clinic's Cloverleaf Immediate Care facility will hopefully reduce the spread of new coronavirus and help those who may have symptoms of the disease without the worry of infecting others around them.

The clinic will be at Cloverleaf Medical Plaza, 5909 U.S. 49, in Hattiesburg.

Dr. Bryan Batson of Hattiesburg Clinic said the Cough and Fever Clinic will take walk-ins, but it is recommended that if people have questions about their symptoms to first contact their primary health care providers.

People without a primary care physician and those without insurance may also come to the clinic to be examined and if need be, tested. No one will be turned away for an inability to pay.

Batson said people should not visit the clinic if they do not have symptoms of the coronavirus, which include fever, a cough, runny nose, sore throat or in some cases difficulty breathing.

Dr. Rambod Rouhbakhsh with Forrest General Hospital said if the model is successful, other areas of the state might soon be developing similar facilities

If you suspect that someone is unfairly raising their prices to take advantage of the outbreak, you may be able to do something about it and our consumer protection team is ready to assist you with your questions.""

First patient had traveled to Florida

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Mississippi was a Forrest County man. The man, under the age of 65, had recently traveled to south Florida. The specific location was not released.

He traveled by plane through the Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, according to a report from the Sun Herald.

Dr. Steven Farrell, chief medical officer at Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg, said the patient did not have symptoms when he landed in Gulfport.

The man later felt ill and contacted the hospital, where staff were prepared to see him, giving him a mask and gloves before he entered the hospital to avoid potential contamination. He is self-quarantined at home, where he is doing well, hospital officials said.

More COVID-19 cases reported

The Health Department on Friday confirmed two additional cases of the virus, a man and a woman, in Forrest County.

One involves a woman over the age of 65, which is among the high risk demographics, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The department said in a news release that she had recently traveled to North Carolina.

Another reported case involves a woman in LeFlore County. She is self-isolating at home. Sunday's additional cases included one in Copiah County, two in Hinds County and one in Pearl River County.

Forrest County, Hattiesburg declare emergency

Following the lead of the federal government on Friday afternoon, Forrest County Board of Supervisor President David Hogan and Mayor Toby Barker both signed documents declaring the response to COVID-19 a local emergency, which has been categorized as a pandemic event, for both Forrest County and the City of Hattiesburg.

This declaration will allow for the use of resources, equipment and money if it is needed to provide for the health and safety of the citizens.

Hogan stated, “Declaring COVID-19 as a local emergency is a precaution. It cuts out the red tape that is often associated with procuring resources, allowing us to serve the residents of Forrest County quickly.”

Barker added, “We know that we are in for a long-term approach in responding to COVID-19, and we know we’ll need the resources to do it. The residents of Hattiesburg deserve our best efforts in keeping them healthy and safe. From personal protective equipment for our medical facilities and first responders to funding for overtime and services provided to our community, making sure they have these resources is a part of that.”

“This declaration is a necessary step in formalizing the process that will allow us to access state and federal resources. It doesn’t mean the situation we’re facing has escalated, but it does give us a tool to use should we need to,” stated Glen Moore, executive director of the Forrest County Emergency Management District. “We’ll continue to work with our emergency management partners at the local, state and federal levels to do all we can to keep our community healthy and safe.”

Coronavirus cases surging in region, U.S.

On Sunday, reports from Johns Hopkins University puts the number of confirmed cases of the virus across the globe at more than 156,400.

Organizers with the long-running Hal's St. Paddy's Parade and Festival parade in Jackson said the event will be canceled this year due to concerns over the spread of the virus.

It marks the first cancellation of the Jackson tradition in 37 years.

Other events across the state were being canceled, as state officials urged people not to have any events or gatherings with large numbers of people, including church services.

Out of an abundance of caution, Lumumba said, the city has postponed several events, including Tech JXN and the Fertile Grounds Expo.

Museum closings

On Thursday, the Mississippi Department of Archives and History also announced site and office closings beginning on Friday. All public events being held at those sites until the end of March have been postponed.

Sporting events canceled

The NCAA announced Thursday that it has canceled its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments amid growing coronavirus concerns. The Mississippi State women's basketball team was a lock to be selected to participate and the men's team had a chance to make the field.

The Southwestern Athletic Conference canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments in Alabama, where both Jackson State basketball teams were scheduled to participate Friday.

The Southeastern Conference suspended all on-campus sporting events between March 13 and at least March 30 and also stopped the men's basketball tournament in Nashville, Tennessee.

Conference USA, the conference Southern Miss belongs to, also announced Thursday a suspension of all spring sports competition, effective immediately, until further notice.

Mississippi, federal court system changes

The Mississippi Supreme Court issued an order Sunday outlining changes due to coronavirus. All courts will remain open, but individual judges have the discretion to postpone any trials on their own docket scheduled through May 15, 2020. Courts shall not conduct any proceedings that require witnesses or parties to travel from an infected area or that involve vulnerable persons, according to the high court.

No more than 50 people are allowed in a courtroom at a given time, changing from the previously limited 200. Access to trials is limited to judges, attorneys, witnesses, security and other necessary people.

Jury summonses may not be sent to jurors which would be returnable to any date prior to May 18, 2020.

Federal courts also announced changes on Monday.

Through March 31, all non-essential civil and criminal cases set for a hearing or trial in any federal courthouse in the Southern District of Mississippi have been postponed.

However, Chief Judge Dan Jordan said initial appearance, arraignments, detention hearings, and issuance of warrants are essential, therefore, they will go on as scheduled.

It will be up to the presiding judge to determine during the period if any other court matter is essential and should go forward or whether the matter can be conducted via videoconference or telephone, Jordan said.

In the Northern District, all proceedings, civil and criminal, scheduled or typically undertaken in person should be continued or conducted by video or telephone conference to every extent possible, said Chief Judge Sharrion Aycock.

Non-essential government employees sent home

Reeves said Monday all non-essential state and local government employees will be sent home. It will be up to agencies to determine which employees are non-essential.

Lumumba said non-essential Jackson city offices and government leased buildings will be closed and non-essential city employees will be required to work remotely. Water and Sewer Business Administration will remain open.

Jatran buses are being cleaned nightly, Lumumba said, and drivers are being provided personal hygiene supplies. Residents should use online city services as much as possible.

All non-essential Hinds County employees will leave work at 5 p.m. today and not return until after March 30, Hinds County supervisors announced at a press conference Monday afternoon. All employees will be paid during the time off, said board president Robert Graham. It was not immediately known if the affected employees would lose sick days due to the break.

“We’re still working our way through that,” Graham said. “This is all brand new to us. We just don’t know…we wanted to be fair to our employees based on the fact that children are at home, they have elderly parents, just a number of different things that we took into consideration and the only way to be fair was just to do it across the board, to all of our employees.”

While non-essential employees will also be sent home from the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department, deputies will continue to patrol. Of those deputies, Sheriff Lee Vance said, “there’s nothing we can do to keep them absolutely safe, it’s basically the nature of the business.”

Visitation at the Raymond Jail has been limited to attorneys only until March 30, Vance said.

County offices, including justice court, will remain open, Graham said.

“One of the things we don’t want to do is try to run each individual department or try to tell any judge what to do,” he said. “They will be making their decisions. Keep in mind, we’re going to modify schedules. We’re not going to close the county government. County government will be open and up and running.”

Graham said the reason for the March 30 date was because it’s “past the 14 day isolation period.” Surrounded by almost a dozen county officials in a room with approximately 35 people, Graham noted that earlier in the day the CDC recommended limiting gatherings to 10 people.

“We’re in violation right now but we’re in violation in the right way for the right reason at the right time for the right cause,” he said.

The CDC recommendations will affect how the county does business but an outline of what it would look like was not immediately clear.

“We’re working our way through that,” Graham said. “To be honest with you, we don’t know yet. We have to make those up as we go along and make sure that we’re trying to make the best decisions for the public as well as our employees.”

Graham said, to his knowledge, no county employees had called in sick due to coronavirus symptoms.

“We want people to remain calm,” he said. “We’re calm. We want people not to panic. We’re going to get through this. That’s the best part of it, we’re going to get through it.”

100,"Feb 25, 2019",Senior Housing News,"Regional Operator Blake Management to Expand Nationwide, Makes C-Suite Hires","A senior living management company with a regional footprint in the Southeast has set its sights on becoming a national presence centered on hospitality.



Jackson, Mississippi-based Blake Management Group (BMG) has quickly grown in recent years by forging joint ventures with development partners, and has made several executive hires in recent months, including adding a new president, COO and chief strategy officer.



BMG’s development partners include Cardinal Ventures; Quality Senior Living; and LifeCare Properties, which last October announced a plan to build up to 10 Blake-branded senior living communities nationwide over the next five years. The company is also working with Legendary Living, the new senior living arm of Legendary LLC, a Destin, Florida-based real estate development and management firm that has specialized in luxury hotel, multifamily and resort properties since its founding in 1991.

BMG currently acts as a third-party manager for 22 senior living communities in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The company plans to grow at a pace of about four to five new community openings annually over the next three to four years, according to BMG’s CEO, Jeremy Cole.



“Conservatively, with our development partners’ pace for designing and building Blake communities, we’ll likely be a 40-plus community company in our future,” Cole told Senior Housing News. “BMG has always been comfortable flying under the radar, and we will continue to operate this way; however, [while] growing and becoming more relevant.”



While The Blake is BMG’s flagship brand, it also operates communities under other brand names, such as The Claiborne at Adelaide in Starkville, Mississippi.

“We know how to build other brands and enable asset partners to grow without the Blake flag, and then manage under our single operating platform much like a Marriott does,” Cole said.



Focus on hospitality



While all of BMG’s communities are designed with local markets in mind, they do share many of the same design elements, amenities and services.



Most of the company’s communities have between 100 and 110 units. While some have a mix of independent living units as well as those designed for higher-acuity residents, BMG’s operational “sweet spot” lies in properties with 65% assisted living and 35% memory care units, Cole said.



They also come with a dedicated space for a cafe, a functioning coffeeshop and ice cream bar, chapels, a business center that doubles as a library and plenty of common spaces for residents to gather. BMG places a special emphasis on fine dining and wellness, with multiple dining venues headed up by executive chefs and staffed with dedicated servers. The company’s dining program is run by Vice President of Dining Darin Leonardson, a former executive chef with Google who joined the company last September.



“We have always wanted to celebrate food and our dining process,” Cole said. “We invest in this experience during the design of our communities and our staffing model, both at HQ and onsite.”

As a result of BMG’s resort-style mix of services and amenities, the company’s communities are competitively priced around the top tier of local markets.



“We work very hard to be an affordable luxury option,” Cole said. “We work very hard to be the nicest offering, the most valuable offering, both from a real estate and a customer service perspective.”



The company has found success in its hospitality-forward model, aided in part by its ambitious early push for deposits. Sales start early, with deposits coming in as early as a year before the community gets its certificate of occupancy.



“One leading metric we’re proud of is how fast we stabilize within 16 to 18 months, which begins with a successful pre-opening and deposit,” Cole said. “We have been stable in certain communities within six to 12 months.”



Hiring for growth



As a fast-growing senior living operator, BMG is only as strong as the employees it can hire.



“The race in senior living will be about transforming how we perform leadership development, which will result in high-performing teams and making good on the promises we make to seniors and loved ones,” Cole told SHN. “New designs and fresh paint are an edge, the marathon will be innovation in recruitment, training and retention.”



BMG named a new president last September, and this week announced the appointment of COO Katie Kleinsmith and Chief Strategy Officer Jessica Heck. Kleinsmith will oversee the company’s core operational functions, help create programs and support onsite community teams, while Heck is tasked with overseeing new developments, sales, strategic growth and project development in addition to being BMG’s new spokesperson.



Kleinsmith is a seasoned industry veteran with 28 years of experience at companies such as Manor Health Care, Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) and Marriott Senior Living, while Heck has spent time at companies including Elmcroft and Atria Senior Living.

Any time BMG enters into a new market, it has a methodology for recruitment. The company finds new workers through job fairs and social media, and opens a central office for each community early on during the construction phase.



“In new development we promote our community both from a sales and recruiting process pretty heavily,” Cole explained. “We get a lot of qualified leaders and applicants there.”



The company also looks to universities as a source of new workers, particularly in college towns with Blake communities. But there’s more work to be done to attract a new generation of employees to the senior living industry, Cole said.



“No one goes to universities and certainly not to Ivy League programs to work in senior living. We need to change that,” he explained. “Terms like ‘conscious capitalism’ get thrown around recruiting circles these days, [and] you can’t find more fertile ground on having a meaningful career than senior living.”

101,"Mar 4, 2020",Washington Post,The Daily 202: Joe Biden forged a Super Tuesday coalition that could win the Democratic nomination – and presidency,"AD

Biden won Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma by double digits. Maine, which the Sanders camp expected to carry, remains too close to call. Sanders won the Pine Tree State decisively in 2016.

“We increased turnout,” Biden told supporters in Los Angeles. “The turnout turned out for us!”

Turnout grew not because of Biden’s ground game, which was essentially nonexistent in the 14 states and one U.S. territory that voted on Tuesday. In fact, he won big in several places where he spent little time and made no real investment in a field program. Momentum mattered more than money. After spending more than half a billion dollars of his personal fortune, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg’s only win came in American Samoa, where Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) also got a delegate.

AD

AD

Turnout also did not appear to grow because of a surge in young voters that Sanders keeps promising will materialize any time now. Exit polls show about 1 in 8 voters in Super Tuesday states were 18- to 29-year-olds, compared to 3 in 10 who were 65 or older. Sanders struggles with these older voters.

Instead, turnout appears to have spiked from 2016 to 2020 in key general election battlegrounds because antipathy toward President Trump continues to galvanize suburban moderates to get engaged in Democratic politics. A Washington Post statistical model suggests Biden won nearly 60 percent of voters who sat out the 2016 primary but cast ballots on Tuesday. Our turnout analysis, conducted by in-house data scientist Lenny Bronner, also shows that Biden possibly received nearly 90 percent of Clinton’s 2016 voters.

Biden romped in the suburbs, excelling with the constituencies that fueled the Democratic takeover of the House in 2018. In addition to his stalwart base of African American voters, the foundation of his wins across the South, Biden fared well with white voters in suburbs from Richmond and Raleigh, N.C., to Houston and Hampton Roads, as well as Nashville and Minneapolis.

Exit polls show that many decided to back the former vice president in the days after his South Carolina landslide. These voters think he’s the most electable choice to take back the White House and that beating Trump is more important to them than agreeing with a candidate on the issues. It also helped Biden that the field winnowed, and he received endorsements on Monday from former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

AD

AD

Biden credited his win in Minnesota, where Sanders invested heavily and held a massive rally on Monday night, to Klobuchar. Exit polls there showed 6 in 10 voters decided whom to vote for in the past few days. Biden won about half that group.

Consider Virginia as a window into why turnout grew. In 2016, 785,000 people participated in the Democratic primary. On Tuesday, about 1.3 million people did. This broke the turnout record set in the 2008 primary that pitted Clinton against Barack Obama. About a quarter of Virginia primary voters were African American, and roughly 6 in 10 chose Biden, according to the exit polls. But Biden also won 6 in 10 white voters older than 45. While Sanders won 3 to 1 among all younger voters, Biden still won the primary in Virginia by 30 points.

“The precincts that saw the biggest increases were largely clustered in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads metropolitan area,” Greg Schneider reports from Richmond. “In Henrico, Kate Giska, 39, a small-business owner and political independent, described Sanders as ‘just too extreme, just like Trump is a little too extreme. We’re kind of, like, in the middle, just, like, status quo, just get along.’ She voted for Biden, someone she thinks has appeal for ‘the middle voter, a candidate that can attract the masses.’ None of more than 50 voters interviewed at three Virginia Beach precincts on Tuesday said they planned to vote for Sanders, even if they liked some of his positions. Many said they simply thought Biden had a better chance of winning in November.”

Biden won from coast to coast among those who identify as “somewhat liberal.” He dominated among conservative and moderate primary voters across most of the 14 states that voted, with the exceptions of Colorado and Vermont. But he also fared very well among the large share of voters who self-identify as “somewhat liberal.” Biden won that group by a roughly 2 to 1 margin over Sanders in Alabama, Virginia and North Carolina. Those latter two states will both be battlegrounds this fall.

Sanders’s coalition is built around liberals and Latinos. One reason he’s widely expected to win California, although the race has not been called with 81 percent of precincts reporting, is that two-thirds of voters described themselves as liberal in the exit polling, and this group voted more than 2 to 1 for Sanders.

Hispanic voters also showed a strong preference for Sanders in the states where they made up the largest shares of the Democratic electorate. About 3 in 10 voters in Texas identified themselves as Hispanic, and just under half of them voted for Sanders. Biden got about 1 in 4 Hispanic votes in the Lone Star State. The share of Hispanic voters was slightly smaller in California, but Sanders won the group by a larger margin, capturing a majority. Biden got about 1 in 5 Latinos in the Golden State, giving Sanders a margin of about 30 percentage points, according to the exits.

Elsewhere, though, Biden made inroads with non-college-educated whites who backed Sanders four years ago. Exit polls suggested Biden had a greater than 2 to 1 lead among white voters in Alabama, and nearly as wide an edge in Virginia. Biden had a smaller but still visible lead among white voters in Minnesota and Oklahoma and a smaller edge in Tennessee, North Carolina and Massachusetts. In Maine and Texas, Biden and Sanders were neck and neck among white voters. And Sanders led among white voters in Vermont, Colorado and California.

Elizabeth Warren’s humiliating third-place finish in Massachusetts, a state she’s represented in the Senate for eight years, makes continuing her campaign increasingly difficult to rationalize. Warren also finished fourth in her native Oklahoma, with 13.4 percent, under the 15 percent threshold required to win any delegates, although not all the precincts have reported. Speaking early Tuesday evening in Detroit as polls remained open in several states, Warren pledged to forge ahead and seemed to plead with late deciders not to keep breaking for Biden. “What I see happening is a lot of folks trying to turn voting into some complicated strategy,” she said, acting almost as if Super Tuesday hadn’t happened. “They are playing games about prediction and strategy. Prediction has been a terrible business.”

After polls closed, Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey backed away from his insistence that the former New York mayor would fight on until the Democratic convention in Milwaukee. “You make an assessment in any campaign like this after any time there is a vote,” he said. “As of right now we are committing to stay in, but we will see what happens tonight.” Another campaign aide told Michael Scherer that the campaign is regularly reevaluated, and that process would continue Wednesday, when Bloomberg is expected to return to New York from Florida.

Whether Warren and Bloomberg stay in or not, this has effectively become a two-man race, pitting the 77-year-old Biden – first elected to the Senate in 1972 – against the 78-year-old Sanders, who was first elected mayor of Burlington 39 years ago Tuesday and who has been in Congress since 1991. But the ideological contrast between the septuagenarians is stark. Sanders promises revolution. Biden pledges restoration.

Sanders is also struggling in some states he won last time because Biden is a less effective foil for him than Clinton. The self-described democratic socialist benefited four years ago in several red states like Indiana, West Virginia and Montana from being the sole alternative to Clinton. He ran up the score among self-identified conservative Democrats. With the benefit of hindsight, many of these folks were probably voting more against Clinton than they were voting for Sanders. But she’s not on the ballot this time. Biden has higher favorability ratings among conservative Democrats than she did, and there were other alternatives, including Bloomberg.

Consider Oklahoma. Sanders won the primary there four years ago by 10 points. “Clinton won self-identified Democrats by 9 points, according to exit polls. But independents, who were free to cross over, backed Sanders by 48 points,” Dave Weigel notes. “While Sanders ran to Clinton’s left, he beat her among self-identified ‘moderate or conservative’ voters by 11 points. Without Clinton as a foil, the Sanders vote fell apart. … Sanders badly lost moderate and conservative voters [on Tuesday], losing them to Biden by 28 points. … Bloomberg won 24 percent of the moderate vote, to just 11 percent for Sanders.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used his speech on Super Tuesday to contrast his voting record in the U.S. Senate with that of former vice president Joe Biden (Reuters)

The fight for the nomination could still drag into the convention in Milwaukee in July, even if Biden continues to consolidate support among moderate voters. Most delegates still have not been awarded, and 32 states still need to vote. Sanders expressed optimism in Vermont last night. “I tell you, with absolute confidence, we’re going to win the Democratic nomination,” he told thousands of supporters.

But, but, but: The calendar is going to get harder for Sanders. “The marquee primary next week will be in Michigan,” Dan Balz explains. “Sanders scored a major upset there four years ago against Clinton, although his victory margin was narrow. Also on the calendar next week is Missouri, a state Sanders lost by less than a percentage point and where the delegates split almost evenly. Missouri will provide another test of Biden’s and Sanders’s support among African Americans, who make up about a fifth of Democratic turnout in that state. Because Washington state has switched from a caucus to a primary, Sanders, though favored, will have a more difficult time piling up the kind of delegate margin he did in 2016. Meanwhile, Mississippi should be fertile ground for Biden, as African Americans made up about 70 percent of the Democratic electorate there in 2016 — even more than in South Carolina.

“The round of primaries on March 17 includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Sanders lost Florida badly to Clinton and will face serious resistance again this year because of qualms about his left-wing agenda. He also lost Arizona and Ohio decisively. Only Illinois was close, though Sanders was on the losing end there, as well. A week after that, on March 24, Georgia holds a stand-alone primary, and there again, Biden will be favored based on the size of the African American vote.”

For his part, Biden will face growing scrutiny that he’s mostly avoided since stumbling in Iowa. He faced few attacks in the last three debates. His performances on the stump can be uneven. Trying to stay disciplined, he delivered his speech in Los Angeles from a teleprompter. Most of it duplicated what he said on Saturday night in his victory speech in South Carolina. “They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing,” he said. “For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.”

More from the states

In Alabama, Jeff Sessions is headed to a March 31 Republican runoff against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in his quest to win back his old Senate seat. “Other Republicans, including Rep. Bradley Byrne and former state Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, significantly trailed,” Mike DeBonis reports. ""Trump has so far remained silent on the race, and Republicans in both Alabama and Washington are speculating whether he might now get involved to block Sessions. … Meanwhile, in North Carolina, Democrats nominated a centrist favorite of national party leaders to take on GOP Sen. Thom Tillis in what promises to be a much more competitive race.”

Texas Reps. Key Granger (R) and Henry Cuellar (D) both claimed victory over primary challengers. “‘You know, we can keep waiting, but it remains 60-40 so far, so I’ll stay here,’ Granger said Tuesday evening … Asked if she was declaring victory, she said ‘yes,’” the Texas Tribune reports. Cuellar “was still fighting a primary challenge from attorney Jessica Cisneros … As of early Wednesday morning, Cuellar garnered 51.6% of the vote to Cisneros' 48.4%, with incomplete returns. The Cuellar victory is a setback for a massive coalition of Democratic allied groups, ranging from the Justice Democrats to EMILY's List to the League of Conservation Voters.""

Long lines kept some Texans waiting to vote until late into the night. “Dozens of Democratic voters were still waiting to cast ballots at midnight in Houston, turning Super Tuesday into a painful slog for some citizens amid questions about how the County Clerk's office had allocated its voting machines across the county,” the Houston Chronicle reports. “Some people in line gave up and walked away … Polls closed at 7 p.m., but voters still can cast ballots as long as they stay in line. … After waiting four hours to cast his own ballot at TSU, Bryan Escobedo walked outside to a crowd cheering his patience. He spoke of voters sharing painkillers and water to keep their neighbors engaged. … The nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project took issue with the delays, noting that many polling places with long waits were in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods.”

The special election in California to replace Katie Hill, the freshman Democratic congresswoman who resigned after admitting an extramarital affair, will head to a runoff. “Democratic Assemblywoman Christy Smith of Santa Clarita and Republican defense contractor Mike Garcia were in a tight race … in one of California’s most competitive congressional districts,” the Los Angeles Times reports. “Former Rep. Steve Knight, the Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Hill, a Democrat, was running third and on the verge of losing his shot at recapturing his seat representing the northern suburbs of Los Angeles.

Commentary from the opinion page:

The new world order

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) asked top health officials at a Senate committee hearing March 3 if they would be honest about the U.S. response to coronavirus. (Reuters)

Vice President Pence said any American can get tested for coronavirus if a doctor orders it.

The comments “perplexed some public health officials, as physicians already have discretion to order testing. The announcement also raised questions about whether the government can rapidly accelerate the production of testing kits, as well as how much patients will ultimately have to pay for getting tested,” Seung Min Kim, Maria Sacchetti and Brady Dennis report. “Pence said roughly 2,500 testing kits approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be distributed by the end of the week, primarily to hospitals in affected areas as well as to others that have requested them. Those kits collectively represent about 1.5 million individual tests. Seema Verma, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said testing for the coronavirus is covered under Medicare, Medicaid and health-care exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act, but it remained unclear how the costs would be handled for the estimated 27 million Americans who are uninsured.”

Washington state confirmed three additional fatalities, bringing the total to nine: “Overall, the U.S. has reported more than 100 confirmed cases. The previously unreported deaths were former residents of the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a nursing home facility that has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the city northeast of Seattle. … Meanwhile, North Carolina reported its first coronavirus case Tuesday, bringing the total to 14 states … New York disclosed on Tuesday its second confirmed case. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) described the patient as a 50-year-old man from Westchester County, who had no recent history of foreign travel.”

Trump’s coronavirus effort has been undermined by mixed messages and falsehoods.

“The White House is handling the rapidly expanding coronavirus as a public relations problem as much as a public health crisis. Officials are insisting on message discipline among government scientists and political aides alike, part of what they say is a responsible effort to try to calm jittery Americans and provide uniform and transparent information,” Philip Rucker, Yasmeen Abutaleb and Ashley Parker report. Trump “has privately griped about what he considers to be hysteria from both the media and his own public health officials … White House aides managing the response have also sought to focus on tamping down what they consider to be alarmist rhetoric. …

“As Trump toured a laboratory at the National Institutes of Health on Tuesday afternoon, he and [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director] Anthony Fauci appeared chummy. The president heaped praise on the infectious-diseases expert, telling him, ‘The world is extremely happy that you’re involved.’ But their bonhomie belied the tensions in an administration where the president tolerates only one star: himself. Public health experts and other government officials have found themselves struggling to manage the delicate balance of performing their jobs while not angering the president or his political aides.”

Quote of the day

“You should never destroy your own credibility. And you don’t want to go to war with a president,” Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci told Politico. “But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.”

Across America, the virus has triggered cancellations, closures and contingency planning.

Trump has “said he did not agree with contingency plans being considered for the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournament, including a proposal to play games in empty arenas,"" Toluse Olorunnipa, Heather Kelly, Hannah Natanson and Julie Zauzmer report. ""'I don’t think it would be necessary,' [he said]. With the lack of a coordinated national approach, local officials and individual communities are rushing to make their own plans. Some schools are considering closures, some companies have implemented restrictions on travel for employees, and religious organizations are altering how they conduct services.”

In turf warfare, the CDC temporarily blocked a top FDA scientist from its campus.

“Timothy Stenzel, who is the director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, was made to wait overnight on the weekend of Feb. 22 — as senior health department officials negotiated his access in a series of calls — before Centers for Disease Control granted him permission to be on campus. Stenzel's visit had been expected … The FDA had dispatched Stenzel to the CDC in an effort to expedite the development of lab tests for the novel coronavirus outbreak,” Politico reported.

The outbreak continues to spread widely in the Middle East, Asia and Europe.

Iran has confirmed 92 deaths and 2,992 cases, while South Korea has 5,238 cases and Italy 2,263. China, which remains the worst-hit nation, announced 38 new deaths. Chile and Argentina reported their first cases yesterday, widening the numbers across Latin America. (Adam Taylor, Teo Armus and Rick Noack)

The U.S. Travel Association anticipates international inbound travel to the country will drop 6 percent between now and May, the largest dip in global visitation since the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. ""The forecast takes into account factors including hotel bookings, airline data and consumer sentiment data,” Hannah Sampson reports.

North Korea’s isolation is a possible virus buffer – but also a concern.

“Kim Jong Un’s insular world also could face a major crisis if the virus that causes covid-19 finds its way in. An outbreak could overwhelm the feeble health system — ranked 193 out of 195 on the Global Health Security Index — in a country already stalked by malnutrition and diseases such as tuberculosis,” Simon Denyer reports.

Doctors in Italy are turning into patients.

“In an effort to cope, Italy is graduating nurses early and calling medical workers out of retirement. Hospitals in the hardest-hit regions are delaying nonessential surgeries and scrambling to add 50 percent more intensive-care beds,” Loveday Morris reports.

Trump spoke with a senior Taliban leader by phone.

This was apparently the first direct verbal communication between a U.S. president and the Afghan insurgent force since the Afghanistan war began. Anne Gearan reports: “Trump confirmed the Taliban’s announcement Tuesday that he had spoken by phone with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s top political leader. ‘I spoke to the leader of the Taliban today. We had a good conversation. We’ve agreed there’s no violence, we don’t want violence; we’ll see what happens,’ Trump told reporters at the White House. ‘They’re dealing with Afghanistan, but we’ll see what happens. We had actually a very good talk.’ Baradar is a senior figure representing the insurgent group in talks with the United States in Doha, Qatar. …

""The phone call is notable for the stature it confers on Baradar. U.S. presidents typically deal directly with other heads of state or government … In a statement, Baradar welcomed the phone call and said that ‘we assure with full confidence that if the U.S. implements the agreement, this will have positive impact on the bilateral relations in future.’ … The Taliban statement quotes Trump as saying the Taliban has been ‘fighting for your country’ and that the time has come for the United States to leave. The Taliban said Trump also pledged that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will speak to [Afghan President Ashraf] Ghani ‘to remove hurdles in the way of intra-Afghan dialogue.’”

The Pentagon said overnight the U.S. military has conducted an airstrike against Taliban forces in southern Afghanistan, the AP reports: “Spokesman Col Sonny Leggett said in a tweet Wednesday that it was the first U.S. strike against the militant group in 11 days. He said the attack was to counter a Taliban assault on Afghan government forces in Nahr-e Saraj in the Helmand province.”

Iran has sharply increased its uranium stockpile since Trump blew up the nuclear accord.

“Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency reported a near-tripling of Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium just since November, with total holdings more than three times the 300-kilogram limit set by the nuclear accord,” Joby Warrick reports. “Iran also substantially increased the number of machines it is using to enrich uranium, the agency said, allowing it to make more of the nuclear fuel faster. … Iran’s low-enriched uranium, the kind typically used in nuclear power plants, would have to undergo further processing to be converted into the highly enriched uranium needed for nuclear bombs. Independent analysts said the bigger stockpile and faster enrichment rate has substantially decreased Iran’s theoretical ‘breakout’ time — the span needed for acquiring enough weapons-grade material for a single nuclear bomb.”

Domestic developments that shouldn't be overlooked

At least 24 people were killed when tornadoes struck central Tennessee on March 3. (The Washington Post)

The tornadoes in Tennessee killed at least 24.

“An EF-3 tornado with winds up to 165 mph tore across the Nashville area,"" Brandon Gee, Meryl Kornfield and Kim Bellware report. Some of the dead were children. ""Dozens more are still missing as of Wednesday morning. The destruction stretched for 50 miles across four counties, and Gov. Bill Lee (R), who surveyed the area via helicopter, said it will take days just to assess the scope of the damage.”

A Louisiana case is the first abortion test for the new Supreme Court.

Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, no state has passed more abortion restrictions that Louisiana. Today, a repopulated and more conservative Supreme Court will consider one of those laws. “Some politicians here wonder if it might be the breakthrough they’ve been waiting for in a decades-long effort to rid the state, and the nation, of abortion,"" Robert Barnes reports from the Pelican State. ""‘I prayed one day that it would come, but I never thought it would be with this bill,’ said state Sen. Katrina Jackson, a Democrat who calls herself ‘pro-whole life’ and says she has been ‘very aggressive’ in pursuing legislation to impose more restrictions. … Abortion providers say Jackson’s law would force two of the state’s three abortion clinics to close. It’s hard to overstate what a decision about this law — requiring difficult-to-obtain hospital admitting privileges for doctors who perform abortions in clinics — will reveal about this Supreme Court and its jurisprudence on [abortion] … It will be the first time the two justices selected by President Trump, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, confront the merits of an abortion case. It marks a key moment for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who has never voted against an abortion restriction, in his pivotal role at the court’s center.”

A new White House questionnaire includes a litmus test for prospective appointees.

“Candidates applying to join [Trump’s] administration will now have to explain what part of Trump's campaign message ‘most appealed’ to them and why,” CNN reports. “The new questionnaire, distributed by the White House's Presidential Personnel Office to federal departments on Monday, … is the latest move by the office's new head John McEntee to emphasize loyalty to the President in the hiring process.”

Speaking of loyalty, John Bolton’s book release date was pushed back to May amid Trump's efforts to block publication, per Tom Hamburger.

BARRETT BOYCOTT -- The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote today on approving Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the Supreme Court. But don’t expect Senate Democrats to be there.

In protest of the GOP’s lightning-fast effort to confirm ACB before the election, Democrats are planning to sit out the committee markup. And instead, they plan to place pictures of people who have been impacted by the Affordable Care Act on their empty seats, per CNN’s Manu Raju , as the party tries to hammer home the message that the public's health care is in jeopardy if ACB is confirmed.

The statement, from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Dems: “This has been a sham process from the beginning. … Throughout the hearings last week, committee Democrats demonstrated the damage a Justice Barrett would do – to health care, reproductive freedoms, the ability to vote, and other core rights that Americans cherish. We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.”

But it doesn’t look like their boycott will stop the GOP from moving forward. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said they can still hold the vote without Dems present. “Judge Barrett deserves a vote and she will receive a vote,” Graham said. “Judge Barrett deserves to be reported out of committee and she will be reported out of committee. Judge Barrett deserves to be on the Supreme Court and she will be confirmed."" The latest from Marianne: https://politi.co/3kpS0GA .

WHAT THE DUCK -- Negotiators are racing to finalize a coronavirus relief bill before the election. But even senior Democrats acknowledge that a deal could slip until the lame duck session of Congress. “The election is less than two weeks away, and I believe we’ll be back in Washington a week or two after the elections and we can do something there,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) told CNN. “At least elections will be behind us. People will know what their futures are.”

And Speaker Nancy Pelosi pinned the blame on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who reportedly advised the White House not to strike a deal before the election. “We obviously want to have a deal by November 3rd. That really is going to be up to whether the president can convince Mitch McConnell to do so,” Pelosi told a Sirius XM show. “However, I don't think, I think Mitch McConnell might not mind doing it after the election.”

But can we even count on action during the lame duck? Some in Washington believe Democrats would rather just hold out for a better deal under the next president if Joe Biden wins, while others think Trump would have little incentive to sign a big bill if he loses. (Not to mention, Congress is going to have to fund the government during that time period as well.)

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters that the lame duck “is a really hard time to get much done.” And here’s what Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told AP’s Andy Taylor: “I think Democrats would want to wait until the new president is sworn in and do it then. And I think Republicans probably would say unless the economy would take a bad turn between now and let’s say Dec. 1 -- and there doesn’t seem to be a sign that’s going to happen … we would say the economy is taking care of it.”

But at the same time, it’s hard to imagine Congress going home for the holidays without delivering much-needed relief to the American people — especially as coronavirus cases are only expected to climb in the winter. And as Pelosi said earlier this week, she wants a deal ASAP so she doesn't have “to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency.” More on the state of play from Marianne: https://politi.co/2HmC2hQ .

SPEAKING of notable quotes … When asked why White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was in the Capitol yesterday, Blunt quipped to reporters: “Maybe he just needed to get out of the White House.” (For the record, Meadows was there to brief Senate Republicans on the relief talks.)

FRUSTRATION IN THE FINAL STRETCH -- Two weeks away from the election, Trump is tweeting about rapper 50 Cent. He’s trashing Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. And he’s picking fights with CBS’ popular “60 Minutes” news program and revered journalist Lesley Stahl. To put it lightly: this is not the closing message that his GOP allies were hoping for.

It’s clear that Trump is on a completely different page than Senate Republicans, undermining the GOP as it fights to hang on to its Senate majority. And frustrations are spilling out into public view. “There’s just not any discipline. I mean the president’s got a great record to run on. But we don’t hear too much about it. And I just think that’s a mistake,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

Some Republicans pressed Meadows during a private GOP lunch about why the president isn't promoting their $500 billion stimulus bill and instead talking about spending more money than Pelosi. But after nearly four years of Trump, some lawmakers just seem resigned to it all. “What he’s thinking about that day, he says it. And that changes moment to moment. And that’s who he is,"" said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.). The dispatch from Burgess, Meridith McGraw and James Arkin: https://politi.co/3kgrHT8 .

ABOUT LAST NIGHT -- DOJ and national security officials held an unexpected news conference last night to announce that Russia and Iran have obtained voter registration data that could aid efforts to interfere in the election. And Iran has already used some of the data it obtained: the country was behind some threatening “vote for Trump” emails, officials said.

The statement from Pelosi and Intel Chairman Adam Schiff, who are among the lawmakers who will be briefed on the threats today: “The bedrock of our democracy is that every citizen has a right to vote and to have that vote count as cast. We cannot allow voter intimidation or interference efforts, either foreign or domestic, to silence voters’ voices and take away that right. … In the face of these ongoing attempts to undermine Americans’ confidence in our elections, it is more essential than ever that voters exercise their sacred constitutional right to vote and to participate in our democracy.”

IS GARDNER A GONER? -- Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado is one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection — and it’s largely because of Trump. The dispatch from Bloomberg Government’s Nancy Ognanovich: “A Democratic ad that aired in Colorado described Sen.

John Hickenlooper.

“Hickenlooper has maintained a healthy lead in the polls in a state that’s trended increasingly Democratic over the past decade, as it grows with an influx of Californians and minorities. It’s one of only two Senate seats held by a Republican in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016 — the other is in Maine — and it’s a cornerstone of the Democrats’ drive to regain control of the chamber. … Democrats’ confidence in winning the seat has grown so much that Senate Majority PAC, which is aligned with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and aired the peanut butter and jelly spots, recently canceled its remaining TV buy in Colorado and moved the $1.2 million to races considered more competitive.” More: https://bit.ly/35ljdUt .

103,1 month ago,Savannah Morning News,Norman Winter: GoldDust pathways will illuminate your garden,"Norman Winter: GoldDust pathways will illuminate your garden

Norman Winter | Savannah Morning News

The Garden Guy was looking at photos of last year’s trials and I was struck by one of a Mecardonia. If you are like most, Mecardonia probably conjures up visions of one of the stops that Moses and the Israelites made while looking for the promised land.

I have never written about this plant and was thinking there is a great chance my readers do not know about how wonderful and tough as nails is this flower and particularly the award-winning variety GoldDust.

GoldDust, a Proven Winners selection, has won 67 awards and from north to south and east to west. It was a Top Performer at Penn State, University of Georgia, Tennessee, Cornell, South Dakota State, Minnesota, Mississippi State, Oklahoma State, and the list goes on for pages. This speaks volumes and mostly of what it will do in your landscape, too!

At the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens in Savannah, we used it in our Cottage Garden around a rock stepping stone path. It was a lot like a Caribbean Cottage, we had gingers, plumbago, shrimp plants and tall garden phlox all pretty, but it was that patch of GoldDust mecardonia that seemed to illuminate the garden. It was also amazing in that it bloomed from the time we planted it until late fall. There are not that many plants that will do that.

Mecardonia has the common name axil flower and when I first started growing it was in the Scrophulariaceae family related to snapdragons and such. Well, that mysterious board of taxonomic nomenclature has moved it, and snaps, too, to the Plantaginaceae or plantain family. But alas they are still related.

Mecardonias are from South America on up through Central America and even into the warmer regions of the Southeastern United States. GoldDust however, is a hybrid and a great one reaching only about 5 inches in height. Can you only imagine a plant at that height that blooms with bright yellow flowers all growing season?

Norman Winter: Hardy hibiscus more than a summer dream in Savannah

Remarkably it spreads outward 20-inches allowing it to be unbeatable around stepping stones, small drifts of groundcover, and for sure, tumbling over the rims of baskets, boxes and containers like old world olive jars. It is easy to grow, requiring no deadheading. Your main goals are to provide sun and moist fertile soil.

You will expect GoldDust to be an annual and of course one worth every penny spent. To get a nice informal drift or patch, plant three or four spacing 12-16 inches apart. They are perennial in zones 10 and word on the street is they have surprised a few in colder zones with a spring return. Don’t count on it but celebrate if they do.

At the Young Plant Farms Flower Trials in Auburn last year, I saw a new application that was simply beautiful. They had combined Blue My Mind evolvulus with the Gold Dust mecardonia letting them intermingle. The icy blue and cheerful yellow created the perfect complementary partnership.

One of my favorite Proven Winners recipes and applications is a window box planting partnering Gold Dust mecardonia with Illusion Garden ornamental sweet potato and Superbena Peachy Keen verbena. It is a warm elegant partnership but not glaring or gaudy.

Tim Warner/Getty Images

Every college coach in the country knows where the talent hotbeds are. If they don't allocate resources and plant coaches in the fertile recruiting soil of certain states, they'll fail to hang with the elite.

When it comes to producing top-tier college football talent, you can probably guess the top four states. That, of course, would be Florida, California, Texas and Georgia. The only problem you may have is putting those in order.

That's why we're here.

Selecting the states producing the most (and best) college football players is an inexact science.

We analyzed the top 100 prospects of the past four recruiting classes (2015-18), according to the 247Sports composite rankings, and took a sample set of 150 of the best players or those with the highest ceilings coming back in 2018.

The states with the highest number of players mattered, of course, but this exercise wasn't just about recruiting rankings. It also takes into account already-established playmakers, and states that have produced the best players get bonus points.

What we came up with may surprise you. The on-the-field production doesn't lie, but neither do the states that churn out star prospects year in and year out. Let's take a look at the states that produce the most college football talent right now.","When it comes to producing top-tier college football talent, you can probably guess the top four states.

Standing tall in the center of America was Cahokia, the most advanced pre-Columbian city the west has ever had and one millennium later, it still remains as the most complex archaeological site in the west.

In its time, Cahokia was a mega marvel, an ancient Manhattan and the heart of America, second only to the lost city of Atlantis. It stood on fertile soil and people from all walks of life and a hundred miles away flocked to the city at its peak.

The city is shrouded by mystery and continues to be a big headache for researchers in terms of its origins. No one really knows what started Cahokia, or what ended it. Using evidence recovered on the site, it is possible to draw a hypothesis.

10 Cahokia Was Equivalent To A Modern-Day New York City

via Pinterest

According to scholars, Cahokia was not just the center of America but the entire world, an imperialist city-state that was advanced but fell off the map for unknown reasons. To this day, historians are still baffled by its mystique and many consider it one of the greatest marvels of ancient America.

Cahokia is comparable to Mecca, where tribes from all walks flock to religious gatherings where they praise deities, often by barbaric means. Plazas were littered around town, and spiritual and political leaders would meet at the biggest mound (Monk's Mound) and everyone was blinded by religion.

8 These Planted The Seeds For An Agricultural Revolution

Cahokians relied heavily on corn and the fertile land contributed to its prosperity and growth. All day, ""commoners"" would endlessly cultivate plots and all of this led to a population boost. Archaeologists have unearthed some preserved plant species on site, such as goosefoot, amaranth, and canary grass.

7 Its Residents May Have Conducted Rituals Involving Human Sacrifice

via Usc.edu

To please the gods, Cahokians embarked in ritualized ""cleansing"" and they would often take beautiful, young women and bring them to the heavens in hopes of a fruitful year. These outrageous acts were heavily recorded and in 2015, researchers found out that victims were all locals and not foreign captives.

In 600 CE, Chunkey was invented in Cahokia. A hardcore sport, natives would often gamble and there are even accounts of losers taking their own lives. The game is played by rolling discs and hurling spears at the said stones, the nearest spear thrown would result in a win. It was so popular that Cahokians crafted figures of Chunkey players, as some sort of a mighty mythological creature.

City planning obviously wasn't as advanced before and this led to the Cahokians' demise, as the whole city stood on the floodplains of the Mississippi river and their doom was inevitable. Recently, flood gates were installed to help preserve the grounds, just after a few centuries.

Another acceptable theory of Cahokia's downfall might have been a hostile takeover of neighboring bandits in which the whole city was pillaged and burned to the ground until either its residents fought to the death or fled to other camps. And when Cahokia was drained of all resources, it then eventually got erased from the map.

108,"Sep 30, 2020",Washington Post,"When we need public health most, our leaders are waging war against it","As we determine what we must do to contain the virus in the coming months — be it through masks and social distancing or new tests, treatments or vaccines — we should also look back, to the origins of public health and why some in this country have never entirely bought into the public health approach.

In the early 19th century, cholera wreaked havoc on the world. Cholera is caused by a toxin-producing strain of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Patients suffer from the sudden onset of diarrhea and vomiting. Their skin is cold and clammy, turns a bluish gray and their eyes are sunken. As quickly as the illness comes on, in the absence of treatment, the victims of cholera too often die.

The Atlantic Ocean initially protected the United States. But by early June 1832, cholera had reached North American shores, first touching down in Quebec City and Montreal, then making its way down New York state’s canal system toward New York City.

Cholera was a disease of growing, crowded cities that had neither the public health infrastructure — clean water, sewage systems, hygiene and sanitation — necessary to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, nor the regulatory frameworks to balance private power and wealth with public good.

Some 30 years earlier, private banking interests had obstructed New York City’s plans for clean public drinking water, leaving the city as vulnerable and fertile ground for cholera to take hold. And as cholera began to spread, business interests prevented the action necessary to avoid an outbreak. The city’s health board was “more afraid of the merchants than of lying,” in the words of historian Charles Rosenberg.

AD

AD

Quarantines had effectively contained the spread of bubonic plague and smallpox, but they upended trade and commerce. Perhaps not surprisingly then, though Mayor Walter Browne prohibited any “vessel … having on board any person sick with … cholera” from approaching the city, quarantine hospital records for ships arriving between April and June 1832 disappeared, making it impossible to know whether quarantine regulations were being enforced. Cases might have slipped through in the name of commerce.

By late June 1832, New Yorkers were falling ill and dying of cholera, but this wasn’t immediately made public, even as physicians pleaded with officials to do so. The mayor and health board feared widespread panic and damage to the economy. Then, as now, journalists held public officials to account. The New York Courier and Inquirer condemned members of the health board for “their unwillingness to report facts.” This pressure made officials more forthcoming.

Almost half of the residents fled the city that summer. The poor, unable to leave and living in squalid neighborhoods like the infamous Five Points, bore the brunt of the disease. More than 3,500 died of cholera, equivalent to almost 120,000 relative to the city’s population today.

Cholera again struck the United States about a decade later, this time killing many not only on the Eastern Seaboard but also along the Mississippi River down to New Orleans and out West, following the California Gold Rush. An estimated 150,000 succumbed to the second (1829-1851) and third (1852-1859) cholera pandemics in the United States — about 1 percent of the nation’s population.

It was during the world’s third cholera pandemic, however, that John Snow solved the mystery of cholera’s transmission. The British physician hypothesized that cholera was transmitted by contaminated water. When cholera broke out in London in 1854, Snow went door to door, mapping the water source for each household: the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks, which drew water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames, or Seething Wells. Snow found that homes receiving the sewage-polluted water had a cholera death rate 14 times higher than other homes.

Snow’s research would help catalyze a new approach to disease control — the public health approach. The science of public health is epidemiology: gathering data, identifying and defining problems, characterizing and measuring risk factors and protective factors, developing and testing preventive measures and scaling up the measures that work. The philosophy of public health is social justice.

AD

AD

Elected officials, informed by Snow’s work, passed laws requiring water companies to move their intakes upriver along the Thames. Officials greeted subsequent cholera pandemics with more public health regulations: water filtration and chlorination and the establishment of health boards.

A confluence of interests helped further public health initiatives. Political revolution spread, first in France in 1789 and 1830, and then across Europe in 1848. A wave of strikes roiled Victorian-era England between 1837 and 1901. The ruling elite feared that if allowed to fester, poverty and disease among the lower classes would lead to civil unrest there, too. Social reformers also understood that a strong economy depended on healthy workers and social stability. “Simple prudence and self-interest,” writes historian Frank Snowden, “and not just humanitarian sentiment indicated reform.” In the United States, even robber barons like Andrew Carnegie recognized the need for “the reconciliation of the rich and the poor — a reign of harmony.”

To this day, the public health approach has been most likely to prevail when this sort of self-interest — be it economic, political or cultural — and humanitarian sentiment align.

AD

AD

The public health approach enjoyed its heyday in the early 20th century during such a period of alignment. There were New Deal programs and policies to support the poor and unemployed. Life expectancy rose by more than 30 years, almost all of which was attributable to public health advances, most importantly better hygiene, sanitation and housing, as well as immunizations.

In the decades to come, the public health approach would bring about the eradication of smallpox, decrease smoking rates, reduce motor vehicle deaths through safer car and roadway design, and produce many other triumphs.

But the second half of the 20th century also saw the rise of modern medicine. While both modern medicine and public health leveraged science to improve health, there was a crucial divergence. Modern medicine did tremendous good for those who could access it but was blind to those who could not — because of inability to pay, distance, a lack of time off for an appointment, systemic racism and more. Public health, however, sought out the marginalized, the oppressed and the hardest to reach. Snow went to the homes of the afflicted, not just the well-to-do who could afford the services of a physician. Public health recognized the value of all human lives, while in medicine, doctors focused on the patients in front of them. Modern medicine helped decouple the fates of the individual and the common.

AD

AD

During the same period, Americans witnessed the expansion of health insurance tied to certain kinds of employment. Racism played no small part in determining who had earned a right to health care and was considered deserving, and who was not. Health became an individual commodity and responsibility. Funding for public health has correspondingly declined relative to economic growth and total health-sector spending. Meanwhile, Europe, Canada and other developed nations established national health systems — a combination of public health and modern medicine — for the common good.","Snow’s research would help catalyze a new approach to disease control — the public health approach.

109,"Jun 26, 2018",FiveThirtyEight,Four Key Questions Today’s Primaries Will Help Answer,"July will be an election desert, so let’s enjoy the primaries while they last, shall we? This Tuesday, five states — Colorado, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah — are holding primary elections, while two more (Mississippi and South Carolina) are holding runoffs to decide primaries held earlier this month. Here are the four big questions we’re hoping those primaries answer (don’t forget to tune into our live blog on Tuesday night for full coverage of everything else on the ballot as well):

1. Does a Trump endorsement pack any punch against a Trump-like candidate?

On a few occasions this election cycle, President Trump has opposed the most Trump-like candidate in GOP primaries in the name of advancing a Republican candidate who seems better-equipped to win the general election. It happened in Alabama when Trump endorsed Luther Strange against Roy Moore, and it happened in West Virginia when he anti-endorsed Don Blankenship. So far, Trump’s record in these bouts has been mixed (Strange lost, but so did Blankenship). Two primaries this week will be good tests of how much the president’s endorsement really matters — or whether anti-establishment Republicans see through it.

In New York’s 11th Congressional District, which is based on Staten Island, Trump is backing the current member of Congress, Republican Dan Donovan. He won a 2015 special election after the previous occupant of the seat, Republican Michael Grimm, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and resigned. Now, after seven months in federal prison, Grimm is gunning for his old job, and he cuts a much more Trumpian figure than Donovan. Grimm, like Trump, has threatened the press and claimed to be the victim of a “witch hunt.” Also, former Trump staffers, such as Steve Bannon and Anthony Scaramucci, have endorsed him.

At first glance, Grimm looks like a long shot: Donovan has far more campaign cash, and the resources of the national party are behind him. But on Staten Island, that may not be an asset. Physically and demographically separate from the rest of New York City, the “forgotten borough” has developed a uniquely resentful, populist conservative political identity that made it fertile ground for Trump. He won the 11th District by 10 percentage points four years after Barack Obama carried it by 4. And Grimm still has plenty of loyal fans who fondly recall his attentiveness to constituents, especially after Superstorm Sandy hit the region in 2012. A Siena College poll conducted between May 29 and June 3 found Grimm leading Donovan 47 percent to 37 percent, but Trump may have rendered that datapoint obsolete by tweeting his endorsement of Donovan while the poll was still in the field. A more recent poll, taken June 20-21, gave Donovan a 7-point lead, but — internal poll siren! — the pollster is owned by a consulting firm that is working for Donovan.

The 11th District is 9 percentage points more Republican-leaning than the country at large, but the nastiness of the primary could provide a general-election opening for well-funded Army veteran Max Rose, the likely Democratic nominee. A win by Grimm, with his criminal past and scorched-earth campaigning, could drive many Donovan supporters into the arms of the Democrats in November. Grimm is also campaigning as a write-in candidate in the New York Conservative Party primary (also this Tuesday); if he wins their nomination, he’ll have a ballot spot in November and the option to continue on with his campaign. A three-way race in November could split the conservative vote and hand Democrats the seat.

The stakes aren’t as high in the Republican runoff for South Carolina governor (the Palmetto State has a safely red R+16 partisan lean), but Trump’s power to persuade is arguably even more on the line. On Monday, the night before the election, Trump popped down to Columbia to hold a rally for Gov. Henry McMaster, a longtime Trump supporter. However, McMaster’s opponent, John Warren, is running as a swamp-draining outsider at a time when an illegal lobbying and influence-peddling investigation focused on a prominent South Carolina political consultant has touched McMaster’s inner circle. Warren has also won the endorsements of the third- and fourth-place finishers from the first round of voting. Unlike in New York, however, the Trump-like businessman appears to be the underdog: In a Trafalgar Group survey conducted this month, McMaster led Warren 60 percent to 31 percent.

2. Can progressive Democrats notch another win against the national party?

Despite a high-profile brouhaha in Texas and one notable exception, the national Democratic establishment has generally done quite well in primaries so far this year. Three races on Tuesday will put that record to the test.

Colorado’s 6th Congressional District (a D+5 partisan lean) and its Republican incumbent, Mike Coffman, have for years been a target of Democrats, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee decided early on that former Army Ranger and Bronze Star winner Jason Crow was its man. That apparently didn’t sit well with former Energy Department adviser Levi Tillemann, who is running against Crow. Tillemann proved his anti-establishment bona fides by secretly recording a conversation he had with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer in which Hoyer urged him to drop out. Although Crow is a mainstream liberal on the issues, he has not taken up the mantle of either single-payer health care or pushing for Trump’s impeachment, both of which Tillemann supports. Crow has dominated the money race with $1.6 million raised, but Tillemann has kept his name in the spotlight with stunts like getting pepper-sprayed in a campaign ad.

Meanwhile, former Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner left the DCCC holding the bag in January when she decided not to run for Congress in New York’s 24th District (D+4). Local Democratic committees consolidated around Syracuse University professor Dana Balter as their candidate to take on Republican U.S. Rep. John Katko, but national Democrats were unsatisfied. Lo and behold, in April, a new candidate, Juanita Perez Williams, unexpectedly jumped into the race, prompting the local parties to denounce the DCCC’s “D.C. meddling.” But Perez Williams may not be the improvement on Balter that national Democrats had hoped. Perez Williams, who somewhat surprisingly lost the 2017 race for Syracuse mayor, failed to top even Balter’s paltry fundraising totals in the most recent period, and she has been attacked for participating in an anti-abortion march two years ago and writing pro-life Facebook posts in 2016. Balter, meanwhile, is favored by the progressive wing of the party.

Finally, in the Democratic primary for Maryland governor, Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker has the support of a litany of big names in Maryland Democratic politics but hasn’t raised a ton of money and isn’t the most engaging campaigner. Meanwhile, former NAACP President Ben Jealous’s support for free college tuition, single-payer health care and legalized marijuana in Maryland (all unlike Baker) has earned him the endorsement of Bernie Sanders and nearly $1 million in air and ground support from progressive outside groups. Even though Maryland is heavily blue (D+24), polling suggests that Baker and Jealous would be equivalent underdogs to popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Hogan enjoys a 57 percent approval rating … among registered Democrats.

Going into Tuesday night, our best guess is that two of the three establishment-flavored candidates will prevail. In Colorado, Crow is seen as a heavy favorite, and in New York, a Siena College poll taken earlier this month gave Perez Williams a 13-point lead over Balter. The progressive wing’s best shot at a win is probably in Maryland, where the two most recent polls of the primary have Jealous either tied with Baker or slightly ahead.

3. Can the Year of the Woman overcome even a multimillion-dollar juggernaut?

Women have been doing extraordinarily well in Democratic primaries in 2018, which hasn’t always been the case in the past. By contrast, wealthy businessmen spending millions of their own dollars to help them win elected office crop up almost every election cycle. What happens when these two recipes for success collide? Three races on Tuesday will give us our answer.

Even before the primary, 2018 has already broken the record for the most expensive gubernatorial election in Colorado (D+2) history. Emily’s List, a pro-choice women’s group that has helped many of the female candidates who’ve won 2018 primaries, has endorsed former state Treasurer Cary Kennedy in the Democratic primary. Kennedy’s campaign and the super PACs that are loyal to her have combined to raise nearly $4 million. However, that’s chump change compared to U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, the second-wealthiest member of Congress, who has poured $11.3 million of his own money into his campaign. And a super PAC supporting the second man in the race, former state Sen. Mike Johnston, has raised $5.7 million, including $2 million from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The second woman in the race, Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, is trailing so badly in fundraising that she has had to resort to attention-grabbing ads like one in which she gets a tattoo of her campaign slogan. According to a Strategies 360 poll conducted from May 23 to June 6, Polis led the primary with 34 percent, followed by Kennedy with 23 percent, Johnston with 12 percent and Lynne with 2 percent.

Likewise, the Democratic primary in New York’s 1st Congressional District may come down to wealthy real-estate investor Perry Gershon and former Suffolk County Legislator Kate Browning. Of the $2.1 million Gershon’s campaign has raised so far this cycle, $1.3 million was loaned or donated by the candidate himself; Browning has pulled in $494,000 total. Both argue they would be strong candidates in November against Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin in this R+12 seat: Gershon with his access to cash, Browning with a blue-collar appeal that she says helped her win her conservative legislative district by wide margins six times.

And the Democratic primary for Maryland’s 6th Congressional District (D+12) has been fought not over issues, but identity. David Trone, the owner of the Total Wine & More liquor store chain, has contributed more than $10 million to his own campaign, more than any U.S. House candidate in history save one — himself, two years ago. Trone argues that Congress needs more “disrupters” like him who have an easier time ignoring the desires of big-time donors like PACs and lobbyists, but state Delegate Aruna Miller thinks diversity is the more important factor in the race. Miller, who didn’t speak English when she immigrated from India at age 7, would become the only woman in Maryland’s congressional delegation. She has the support of Emily’s List and, at $1.4 million, enough fundraising to lead the money race in most any other district.

4. Will incumbent Democrats get a scare?

Despite early signs that Democrats might get their own version of the tea party, no Democratic members of Congress have lost primaries yet this cycle. That probably won’t change in one of these races, but a trio of long-serving Democratic members of Congress are facing genuine challenges. In Colorado’s 1st District (D+42), vocal progressive Saira Rao wants to become the first woman of color elected to Congress from Colorado. Rao’s fundraising levels have been competitive with those of incumbent Rep. Diana DeGette.

Likewise, progressive activist Suraj Patel has pulled in more than $500,000 in each of the last two quarters in New York’s 12th District (D+64), besting incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney. Maloney has courted controversy over the years, including by making comments in 2012 wondering if vaccines cause autism and by dismissing Patel’s donor list as containing “a huge amount of the name Patel.” Maloney has pilloried Patel for being a transplant from Indiana and for being linked to reported labor-law violations through his family business; the sharp attacks may imply that the race is closer than people assume.

And in New York’s 14th District (D+56), former Sanders campaign organizer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has an uphill climb against moderate Rep. Joe Crowley, the head of the Queens Democratic Party, No. 4 Democrat in the U.S. House and potential future candidate for speaker. Ocasio-Cortez is 28 years old, of Puerto Rican descent and an avid progressive; Crowley is 56, of Irish descent and has raised 10 times as much as his opponent.

Maryland’s U.S. Senate (D+24) race might even have turned this trio into a quartet if things had unfolded a little differently. Incumbent Ben Cardin is as safe as safe can be, but all eyes will be on how many votes transgender activist and convicted leaker of classified material Chelsea Manning garners in her Democratic primary challenge. By any normal measure (e.g., raising $81,000 for a statewide campaign), she is not running a serious race.","He won a 2015 special election after the previous occupant of the seat, Republican Michael Grimm, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and resigned.

110,"Jan 24, 2019",Rutgers-Camden NewsNow,"Rutgers University–Camden Partners with City, Cooper’s Ferry on $1 Million Bloomberg Philanthropies Grant to Transform Illegal Dumping Sites into Art Spaces for Camden Neighborhoods : Rutgers-Camden C","On Jan. 24, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that Camden, New Jersey has been named a Bloomberg Philanthropies 2018 Public Art Challenge winner. The city will receive $1 million for “A New View,” a public art project that will transform sites plagued by illegal dumping along major transit corridors into dynamic art spaces, inspiring residents and attracting visitors. It will include art installations and creative programming at several sites along Camden’s rail, road, and bike routes.

As a lead partner in “A New View,” Rutgers University–Camden will encourage residents to combat illegal dumping of household and or industrial waste through education efforts and public-private partnerships. The city also aims to strengthen the local artistic community and improve the quality of life for Camden residents. Led by the urban redevelopment nonprofit Cooper’s Ferry Partnership and the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts, the collaboration will engage independent curators, the Camden Collaborative Initiative environmental consortium, the Camden City Cultural and Heritage Commission, local businesses, and residents.

Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LP, and mayor of New York City (2001-2013), says, “Public art has the power to bring people together to strengthen their communities. Camden is harnessing that power by transforming dumping sites into works of art along the city’s public transit routes, which will symbolize – and further spur –the city’s ongoing resurgence. I’m glad to congratulate Camden on being a winner of our Public Art Challenge.”

“As an anchor institution in Camden, Rutgers–Camden has always believed in the power of art to heal and strengthen our communities,” says Phoebe A. Haddon, chancellor of Rutgers University–Camden. “For more than 40 years, our Center for the Arts has transformed lives and neighborhoods through our arts education programs for Camden children and our community arts program for Camden residents. We are excited that the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts will work with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the City, and Cooper’s Ferry Partnership in curating and developing these lots.”

Sites will include illegal dumping locations along the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) high-speed line, RiverLine light rail, and the Camden GreenWay trail network. Art installations and events along these routes will repurpose the sites as active spaces for the city. By visiting the art works along the trails, residents and commuters will experience Camden’s riverfront, neighborhoods, and communities in a new light.

Mayor Francisco Moran says, “Illegal dumping is unsightly, unlawful, and costs the city over $4 million annually. This winning project provides a unique way to bring together residents and artists to address this issue with creativity and create a brighter future for Camden. I have made solving this problem the cornerstone of my administration.”

The City and Cooper’s Ferry Partnership have long been working to address illegal dumping through the Camden Collaborative Initiative and Connect the Lots. Through Connect the Lots, a variety of artistic and cultural outdoor activities have been designed to engage residents and activate vacant and underutilized spaces in Camden neighborhoods.

“This funding will allow Camden’s best and brightest artists, curators, and community-builders to come together to beautify highly visible areas of the city. ‘A New View’ will shine light on important urban issues, and strengthen our neighborhoods and tourism sector,” says Kris Kolluri, president and CEO of Cooper’s Ferry Partnership. “We can’t thank them enough for this opportunity.”

About the Public Art Challenge:

In February 2018, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited mayors of U.S. cities with 30,000 residents or more to submit proposals for temporary public art projects that address important civic issues and demonstrate an ability to generate public-private collaborations, celebrate creativity and urban identity, and strengthen local economies.

More than 200 cities applied for the 2018 Public Art Challenge with proposals reflecting diverse artistic mediums addressing a range of pressing issues and social themes such as community development, environmental sustainability, cultural identity and immigration. Fourteen finalists were announced in July.

Camden is the fifth and final winning city of the Public Art Challenge. In November, Anchorage, Alaska was the first city to be announced as a winner in the second Public Art Challenge for “SEED Lab,” followed by Coral Springs in partnership with Parkland, Florida for “Inspiring Community Healing After Gun Violence: The Power of Art,” Jackson, Mississippi for “Fertile Ground,” and Tulsa, Oklahoma for “The Greenwood Art Project.”

Submissions were evaluated on a number of factors, including their potential viability as dynamic public art projects, impact on civic issues, community engagement strategies, and capacity to establish or strengthen public-private partnerships.

The Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts (RCCA), a distinguished arts organization recognized by the New Jersey State Council of the Arts, provides performances, exhibitions, education programs, and community projects that inspire a full appreciation and enjoyment of the arts. The RCCA creates meaningful opportunities to participate in the arts, advances the central role of the arts in pre-K-12 education, and increases awareness of the arts as essential to cultural, economic, and community vitality.

Bloomberg Philanthropies has a proven track record of supporting creative and innovative public art. Over 400 cities have submitted proposals for consideration in the Public Art Challenge since 2014. The foundation’s inaugural Public Art Challenge catalyzed $13 million for local economies across the four winning regions and illuminated civic issues including economic decline, vacancy, water conservation and police-community relations.","On Jan. 24, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that Camden, New Jersey has been named a Bloomberg Philanthropies 2018 Public Art Challenge winner.

111,"Apr 3, 2020",Eos,Finding Natural Solutions to Man-Made Problems in River Deltas,"Decades of research on river deltas identify gaps in our knowledge of delta behavior and the tools required to fill them in.

River deltas are dynamic systems, fed by sediment flows and shaped by tides and wave action over long timescales. They’ve long proved fertile ground for human civilization. Many of the world’s biggest cities are located on river deltas, where easy access to marine transport, fishing, and coastal soils gives them an economic boost. But human activities and climate change have led to the instability of deltas around the globe, threatening the ecosystem services they provide. Reservoirs and demand for sand, for example, have left many deltas starved of sediment: The Nile Delta, the Mississippi Delta, and the Yellow River Delta are all experiencing shoreline erosion as sea level rise, land subsidence, and dwindling sediment supply interact.

Coastal communities have a vested interest in promoting delta resilience, but there’s growing understanding that our conventional and inflexible strategies for managing deltas—including storm surge barriers and river embankments—are unsustainable in the face of climate change. Managers are turning to nature-based solutions, but those solutions require deep knowledge of stable delta behavior. There is almost no place on Earth left undisturbed by human activities, which makes modeling and predicting modern delta behavior all the more challenging. It’s critical to develop natural solutions to contest the challenges deltas face.

Here Hoitink et al. synthesize recent research on river deltas to identify the ways that human activities interact with natural processes to create instability and discuss the tools that researchers can use to better understand those processes and render deltas resilient. The study area spanned the globe, using the best-studied delta systems, such as the Mississippi in the United States, the Rhine-Meuse in the Netherlands, and the Yellow River of China, to inform about process evolution of deltas.

The team identified four main processes revealing delta instability that relate to both natural dynamics and human activities: riverbank failure, channel incision and siltation, river avulsions, and a shift to hyperturbidity. These processes take place over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Riverbank failure, or a dredging-induced hyperconcentration of suspended sediment, can occur over relatively short timescales (years to decades), whereas channel bed erosion and the formation of a new deltaic landscape may require centuries.

The authors call for the development and improvement of a host of analysis tools to better understand these complex processes, including numerical modeling, network and dynamic system theory, and direct and continuous observations. Empirical data sets on the behavior of past and present river delta systems can help inform predictions of delta behavior in the future.

The major challenges that remain, according to the authors, are determining the annual sediment balance, predicting the impacts of dwindling sediment supply and sea level rise, and combining approaches to monitoring and modeling river deltas to optimize our understanding of river delta resilience in our rapidly changing world.

The coup de grace could come Monday night, if LSU beats Clemson in the CFP national championship game in New Orleans.

Whatever happens Monday, it’s been — to this point, at least — a pretty darn good season of college football for Louisiana.

After 11-3 UL beat Miami (Ohio) 27-17 at Monday night’s LendingTree Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, in fact, Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards tweeted, “And with this win, the state of Louisiana’s college football teams remain undefeated in postseason play this season,” along with hashtags including #LouisianaProud.

Louisiana Tech, indeed, beat the other Miami, the one from Florida, 14-0 at the Independence Bowl in Shreveport to cap a 10-3 season. And Tulane finished 7-6 after beating Southern Mississippi 30-13 at the Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth, Texas.

Not every Louisiana program enjoyed super success this season.

UL Monroe finished 5-7, and Grambling — by its own high standards — had a down year at 6-5.

But McNeese also finished above .500 at 7-5, and fellow FCS members Nicholls and Southeastern Louisiana both won first-round FCS playoffs games.

What’s behind it all?

“I think it’s that Louisiana water,” Ragin’ Cajuns senior safety Deuce Wallace said.

But is it simply runoff from fertile recruiting ground in the state — and surrounding areas including Texas and Mississippi — or is there more to it than that?

More: LendingTree Bowl victory gives Cajuns record 11th win

“First of all, I think we’ve got some exceptional coaches in the state,” Cajuns coach Billy Napier said in Mobile a few days before UL’s LendingTree Bowl win. “You’ve got to give all these coaches that have had good years (credit).

“And some maybe didn’t have quite as good a year this year, but they’ve had terrific programs.”

Then there’s that recruiting angle.

“I do think we all benefit from the proximity of a lot of good high school football players,” Napier said.

“There’s about a hundred Division I players a year in just the state of Louisiana, not to mention this I-10 corridor — East Texas, Houston, the Panhandle (of Florida), south Alabama, south Mississippi.

“So we’re benefiting from proximity,” he added, “and certainly I think the universities and administrations at those schools have committed to having good programs, and those coaches and players have done a terrific job.”

So UL, Louisiana Tech and Tulane did their parts.

Nicholls and Southeastern Louisiana did theirs.

Now it’s up to LSU to close the deal.

The Tigers will try to do so with some who have Ragin’ Cajun ties on their side.

Former UL offensive coordinator Jorge Munoz — an assistant on the staffs of two ex-Cajun coaches, Mark Hudspeth and Rickey Bustle — is now an offensive analyst at LSU.

Munoz has been so instrumental to the success of the Tiger offense this season that quarterback Joe Burrow invited him to New York last month for the 2019 Heisman Trophy ceremony and made sure to mention him in his acceptance speech after winning.

His work has gotten nationwide notice, and in the past few days he was mentioned in multiple reports as a candidate for the vacant offensive coordinator position at Oregon.

Former Cajuns quarterback Blaine Gautier, who led UL to its 2011 New Orleans Bowl win over San Diego State, is an LSU offensive analyst too, and has been for a few years now.

And ex-Cajuns starting offensive lineman Jonathan Decoster coached tight ends in Baton Rouge.

So UL fans have a vested interest in Monday’s title game, like LSU or not.

And if one Cajun is to be believed, there is really is plenty of support for the Tigers even across the interstate in Lafayette.

“Yeah,” Wallace said in Mobile, “we definitely root for those Bayou Bengals down the road, and we’re all rooting for them to finish it off.

“They definitely deserve it.”

Doing it would be one more notch — and the biggest, by far — in the belt of a land with plenty of them this season.

“It’s a great time in this state when it comes to that,” Napier said with reference to Louisiana’s success so far, “and certainly I think there’s a certain level of pride that goes with that, and we’re fortunate to be involved with that.”

Growing your own juicy tomatoes or crisp peppers sounds idyllic. But in practice, backyard farming can be daunting. Many gardeners dealing with pests, weeds and unpredictable weather quickly find themselves questioning whether they are working with nature or against it.

Just ask John and Molly Chester, who bought a sandy, barren plot of land in Southern California eight years ago in the hopes of starting the farm of their dreams. New to farming, the couple relied on holistic, regenerative practices (and a lot of trial and error) to revive Apricot Lane Farms. Through their hard work, the 214 acres are now a lush, largely regenerating ecosystem with fertile soil, diverse animal life and an abundant orchard with well over 75 varieties of fruit trees. Better yet: The farm never uses toxic, synthetically derived pesticides, which can kill soil microorganisms, harm pollinators and other wildlife, pollute waterways and make us sick.

John and Molly Chester

Yvette Roman

The Chesters' story, recounted in the documentary The Biggest Little Farm, is a testament to the wisdom of nature's own fine-tuned systems — and the remarkable rewards that gardeners will reap if they follow its lead. Here's how to cultivate a bit of Apricot Lane Farms' success in your own backyard.

Feed Your Soil When the Chesters arrived at Apricot Lane Farms, the ground was dry, hard and mostly devoid of life. They knew they'd need to convert dead dirt back into soil before they could grow any crops. ""When it's biologically diverse, soil is like this alchemizer of death into life, but you have to feed it,"" John said. Feeding the soil means building its biota — its below-the-surface ecosystem of microorganisms like bacteria and fungi, which break down decaying organic matter and infuse the soil with nutrients for the next cycle of plant life. If you find yourself with similarly unhealthy soil, the Chesters recommend worm compost tea: worm waste steeped in water to make a liquid fertilizer teeming with beneficial microorganisms. At Apricot Lane Farms, the couple built an entire vermicomposting (worm composting) facility, but you can make do at home. Just put some worm castings, i.e. the black earthy-looking particles in your compost bin (you can also purchase a bag of castings) into a bag made from old panty hose, cheesecloth or a porous T-shirt. Add the tea bag to a pitcher or bucket of water. ""Brew"" your tea by adding a sugar supply like molasses for the bacteria (which will feed and multiply) and a small aerator (like a bubbler you'd add to a fish aquarium), which will concentrate the beneficial aerobic microorganisms. Let it bubble for one to two days, stirring occasionally, until a layer of foam develops — a good sign of active microorganisms. Apply to your soil within 48 hours. (If you'd like more information before brewing your own, step-by-step recipes and video tutorials on making worm tea abound.)

Plant Cover Crops Cultivating native grasses, or simply refraining from ripping out last year's garden plants, will help you maximize the number of living roots in the ground, which offers many benefits to your soil. But by far the best means of nourishing and building up your soil is by planting cover crops. Farmers often plant them after the primary crop has been harvested or in areas that would otherwise be bare. And as John and Molly can attest, they're a critical component of any holistic farming practice. Not only do they protect exposed soil from the baking sun, which can kill critical fungal communities and other important microorganisms, but they also prevent erosion, naturally suppress weeds, improve soil quality, sequester carbon from the atmosphere and minimize flooding.

Cover crops can also enrich your backyard garden. Many gardeners plant them in the fall, in order to protect the soil through the winter and into the spring. Cover crops can also carry nitrogen from the air down into the soil, eventually making it available for the roots of other plants. Come spring, you can then turn these plants into ""green manure"" by mixing them into the soil and letting them decompose, which releases beneficial nutrients. ""Cover crops are protecting this complex universe beneath the ground,"" John said. ""They're also creating soil structure with their roots and increasing oxygen so that you get healthy, aerated soil that is filled with aerobic bacteria instead of anaerobic."" At Apricot Lane Farms, cover crops include a ""cocktail of grasses and legumes,"" though the best species for your backyard will depend on climate and your garden's specific needs, be it weed resistance or soil regeneration. A few common cover crop varieties to investigate: Hairy vetch: This legume is hearty, resilient and a powerful nitrogen fixer. Its long roots also help break up soil.

Buckwheat: Known as a ""smotherer,"" this cover crop will naturally help keep weeds at bay while attracting pollinators. It can then easily be tilled into the soil.

Clover: The many species of this legume are known to be versatile and powerful nitrogen fixers.

Alfalfa: This crop's long roots help aerate and bring up nutrients deep within the soil.

Peas: These legumes taste good, yes, but they also fix nitrogen and crowd out weeds, too.

Marigold: Well known for its vibrant flowers, this plant also naturally controls pests like insects, frogs, fungi and weeds.

Maintain Habitats for Pollinators and Other Native Wildlife Biodiversity rules at Apricot Lane Farms. By planting hundreds of plant species with a wide variety of roles, the Chesters have invited in diverse animal life. ""Think about an ecosystem as the planet's immune system,"" John said. ""You're trying to imitate that biodiversity."" In other words, a diverse ecosystem has better odds of being able to heal itself. Keeping as many pieces as possible of that ecosystem intact provides a natural check on any one plant, animal or disease running amok. Here are some biodiversity boosters for your own backyard: Introduce native flowering species that provide food for visiting pollinators.

Hang a bee nesting box somewhere it can get sunlight and warmth.

Provide green, leafy plants for caterpillars to eat, such as milkweed for the monarch butterfly.

Set up a small wood pile, using brush or old logs, as shelter for lizards, fungi and snakes (the latter can eat other pests, like slugs or rodents).

Plant trees or shrubs that provide plenty of nesting and cover for birds, or set up a bird house.

Add a barn owl box or just a simple roosting perch to a pole. Owls and hawks help with rabbits and gophers.

If you have the space, create a reliable water source in the form of a pond or container garden, which will make your yard more attractive to birds, frogs and dragonflies. Stem the problem of mosquitoes by including goldfish or guppies, which eat the bugs.

Plant a diversity of cover crops. Instead of just using clover, for instance, mix your clover seeds with some hairy vetch, legumes and more to help your soil reap a diversity of benefits.

To Manage Pests, Play Detective, Then Look to Nature to Help Crack the Case Over the years, the Chesters have dealt with everything from snail infestations in the orchard to hungry coyotes picking off their chickens. But the challenges have only made them better problem solvers, says John. He suggests that every gardener facing an intrusion — whether by pest, predator or disease — ask a few questions before attempting to control it, especially through artificial means like pesticides or other harsh chemicals. For starters, understand the source of the problem and what might be fueling it, he says. Then look at what its food is, and in turn what eats it. Finally, ask what conditions it does not like and what conditions benefit its predators. With those answers, you may find a nature-friendly solution. Take slugs, the bane of many a gardener. If they're chomping down on too many of your leafy plants, think first of what could provide a natural check. Toads and beetles will snack on the slugs if given the proper habitat themselves, potentially ridding you of your problem without requiring use of chemical pesticides. You can also address what snails don't like — sharp, rough ground — and put a layer of crushed eggshell around your plants, which act as a natural deterrent. ""You start to frame the complexity and context of the things you're trying to coexist with,"" John said. ""It's not harmony you want,"" he added, but a ""comfortable level of disharmony.""

114,"May 17, 2019",Indianapolis Star,How Indiana craft beer is helping save porpoises in Florida,"CLOSE USDA/Indiana Natural Resources Conservation Service conservationists drive a set route on county roads monitoring farmland conditions of soil, water quality. Indianapolis Star

Indiana's progress in reducing agricultural runoff that's polluting the Mississippi River Basin and causing a ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico has been halted in recent years, and new data reveal that the effort may be stalling in other states.

But Caleb Michalke has found a solution for his family's farm — craft beer.

After Michalke's father harvests his soybeans each fall, he plants barley to hold the soil and fertilizers in place during the winter. The barley then goes into the younger Michalke's malt house, Sugar Creek Malt, which supplies beer brands such as Sun King, 3 Floyds, Upland Brewing and Central State.

Buy Photo State soil health specialist Stephanie McLain check a soil's health under a cover crop, as USDA members of the Indiana Natural Resources Conservation Service check farmers' fields for soil condition and management, Monday, April 22, 2019. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar)

It's one example of an economic solution to an entrenched problem plaguing modern agriculture and the environment.

The runoff from bare fields left after corn and soybeans are harvested contributes to toxic algal blooms that appear in Geist Reservoir, and have caused fish kills in places like Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico, where tons of porpoises, manatees, sea turtles and other marine species washed ashore last year. The nutrient laden runoff also contributes to an enormous Gulf ""dead zone,"" where low oxygen levels compromise the marine habitat.

Planting fall crops can help

A key part of the solution is cover crops. In Indiana, some farmers plant crops such as barley, rye and turnips in the fall, to keep soil and chemicals from washing into waterways after cash crops such as corn and soybeans are harvested. The practice grew more than 500 percent between 2011 and 2015. Then by 2017, the practice had dipped by 18 percent, according to data from the Indiana Natural Resource Conservation Service.

Now, two other states are also showing signs of slowing progress. Iowa and Illinois increased cover crop use by hundreds of thousands of acres between 2015 and 2017, doubling the prevalence of cover crops in each state, according to satellite data recently released by the D.C.-based Environmental Working Group.

But several counties across all three states appear to have lost cover crop acres in the same time span.

Exactly why the practice is declining is unknown, but some cite economic uncertainty in agriculture.

And now agricultural officials are looking for ways to revive that interest.

Millions of taxpayer dollars are subsidizing cover crops, but widespread adoption remains elusive. Only about 11 percent of Indiana's farmland was sown with cover crops at its peak in 2015. That dropped to about 8 percent in 2017. More than 90 percent of the farm acres in Indiana, Iowa or Illinois did not get planted with cover crops that year.

Yet the benefits can be huge. Cover crops, planted late in the season, hold soil in place and prevent fertilizer runoff. In Indiana in 2017, they helped keep roughly 5.5 million pounds of pollutants out of Indiana's waterways, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

Conservationists also stress that there are long-term financial benefits to cover crops, but in the short term, the practice is an added cost with a steep learning curve. During financially stressful years, some farmers have a difficult time justifying the expense to plant a crop they ultimately kill and cannot sell.

“I think it’s pretty amazing they doubled the footprint,” Soren Rundquist, EWG's spatial analysis director and study coordinator, said of Iowa. “But the sobering reality is that 1 million acres is just a drop in the bucket.”

There are many reasons why farmers might stop planting cover crops or be apprehensive to try, said Shannon Zezula, state resource conservationist at the Indiana Natural Resources Conservation Service. The practice can be costly, both in time and money. During hard years, farmers may choose to forgo the expense.

Steve Berger, an Iowa farmer who has been growing cover crops on his farm since the 1990s, doesn’t know why cover crop acres in his county fell off in 2017.

But low commodity prices and tariff concerns may have taken a toll on local cover crop acres, Berger said.

“When there are too many challenges, cover crops will be the first things to go,” Berger said.

The struggle to expand cover crop use has some farmers and experts wondering if it would be better to encourage cover crops that can be harvested for a profit.

""We are not giving up on this,"" Zezula said. ""We know we’re onto something.""

Putting his love of beer to work

That's where Michalke comes in. Across the Midwest, farmers plant barley as a cover crop, sowing the seeds in the fall after the corn or soybean crop. When spring comes, they'll kill the barley before sowing their next cash crop.

Things are different on Michalke's family farm, where the barley is harvested and used in malt that goes into beer.

Michalke didn't get into barley for the soil and water benefits — his main interest was to create a business that melds his agricultural background with his interest in brewing. But on bad years, he's thankful to have the barley in the ground, even if the grain crop goes sour.

“That’s the nice thing about barley,” he said. “This winter for instance. We lost everything this winter but at least we have a cover crop.”

Michalke's product is niche — his malt house can process between 200 and 300 acres worth of barley per year. That's no solution in a state with 14 million acres of farmland.

But conservationists hope that more farmers will find opportunities to turn a profit on their cover crops.

Terry Ward, a farmer in northeastern Iowa, plans to harvest a rye crop in June and turn it into food for 125 heifers he feeds for a local dairy farmer. Once the rye is gone, Ward will sow soybeans, a practice known as double cropping because he gets two crops from the same land in one year.

“We think it’s cost effective because we get a year’s worth of feed and a crop besides,” Ward said. “We had 51 bushels per acre (of soybeans) last year, which we think is pretty good.”

Karyl Fritsche, a district conservationist at the Prairie du Chien office in Wisconsin, wants to see cover crops as part of farmers' bottom lines.

Fritsche is located in the ""driftless region"" of Wisconsin, an area untouched by glaciers and where farmers cultivate steeper slopes. The region's fertile soil blows in from Iowa.

""It’s a pretty fragile soil, so we worry an awful lot,” she said.

Crop rotation provides immediate benefit

Fritsche is working on a project to experiment with farmers adding a third crop to their corn-soybean rotations. In this scenario, farmers plant winter wheat after harvesting their soybeans in the second year. The wheat acts as cover and then is harvested in the spring.

Crop rotation is nothing new, but it's largely fallen out of practice in modern agriculture. Farms in Indiana largely alternate between corn and soybeans each summer. Adding a winter cover crop brings some of the benefits of a more varied crop rotation, but Fritsche said that adding a third cash crop such as wheat can actually enhance the benefits of cover crops.

“If we start adjusting our crop rotations, and I’ve done that, you see a much more immediate benefit,"" she said.

Identifying market-based incentives to reduce nutrient runoff has become a priority for federal agencies. In December, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that they would be renewing a joint effort to find ways to reduce nutrient runoff without regulation.

Since then, the EPA signed a memorandum of understanding with the Water Research Foundation to research and identify ""innovative approaches"" to preventing nutrient runoff. The federal agencies have also been meeting with their state-level counterparts over the last several months, according to Ken Labbe, a spokesman for the EPA.

Water quality also got a nod in the 2018 Farm Bill, which now directs USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to prioritize practices that have a direct impact on improving water quality. (Zezula said that his department is waiting for further interpretation of the Farm Bill.)

Wisconsin's Fritsche, however, hopes that creating new markets for the crops that create healthy water and soil will help farmers make good environmental choices without a government incentive.

""We don’t have to offer a government payment if the cash flows,"" she said.

116,"Nov 21, 2019",EducationNext,New Jersey Enforces Its Amistad Law,"The state of New Jersey is taking a major step to ensure that all students learn about the history of enslavement and its impact on our nation’s development. Governor Phil Murphy announced that public school teachers will get to travel to sites associated with the slave trade to learn how to better teach black history throughout the entire school year.

The initiative will help schools to comply with the state’s Amistad law, which requires all public schools to teach African American history. The Amistad law, named for the slave ship that was the subject of a 1997 Steven Spielberg film, was signed in 2002 but it has not been widely implemented. That changed this school year with Education Commissioner Lamont O. Repollet’s goal of ensuring that districts follow the law. If districts are not following the law, they can lose points on their state evaluation.

Few states, if any, have similar requirements. Along with New Jersey, those states include Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, New York and Rhode Island. In Florida, state law requires that black history be infused in its curricula but, as has been the case in New Jersey, it is not being done. In Pennsylvania, only the Philadelphia school district requires a course on black history and the Civil Rights movement for graduation from high school.

States and districts differ in their approaches to teaching about enslavement or black history. In their official standards for teaching social studies and history, some states explicitly call for teaching about aspects of slavery throughout a student’s K-12 education, while others refer to it in passing or not at all.

New Jersey’s commitment to teaching this subject properly matters in light of what is known about variation in how schools approach the topic. School board members in Southern states have scrutinized how textbooks tackle the issue, which can also make students and teachers uncomfortable.

When I became a social studies teacher, I felt that it was my duty to teach the untold history of enslavement in the United States and New Jersey in particular. Most of this untold history I myself didn’t learn until I arrived on a college campus.

I remember the sanitized and minimized history lessons I received on African enslavement. In fourth grade, I learned about the history of New Jersey. However, New Jersey’s history of enslavement and opposition to emancipation was left out. I wasn’t taught about the resistance of the enslaved or the various rebellions of the enslaved. I wasn’t taught the evil and sinful nature of the peculiar institution.

Some worry that “adding” more material about slavery to the history curriculum will push other things overboard. I remember being baffled at having to teach 300 years’ to 400 years’ worth of events in 8 to 10 months. While school districts have the freedom to choose going either the chronological or thematic route when teaching history, the traditional way to teach history is going the chronological route. I did that my first year of teaching. But I quickly switched to a thematic approach because it allowed me to cover black history as American history while looking at critical moments in our nation’s history such as war and conflict, enslavement, displacement, and Reconstruction.

Another concern is that excessive focus on enslavement in America would encourage black students to think of themselves as victims. But teaching slavery well includes telling stories of black characters not only passively being acted upon but also serving as protagonists in liberation, emancipation, and abolition.

Slavery’s role in American history recently received a new burst of attention resulting from the 1619 Project undertaken by the New York Times.

New Jersey is particularly fertile ground for slavery education. Slavery persisted in New Jersey longer than elsewhere in the North; when an emancipation law was passed in 1804, it went into effect only gradually. Abraham Lincoln lost New Jersey in the elections of 1860 and 1864; it was the only northern state to vote against Lincoln. In 1863, the legislature opposed emancipation of those who remained enslaved. In 1865, the state legislature wouldn’t ratify the 13th amendment. In 1866, the state legislature rescinded ratification of the 14th amendment and rejected the 15th amendment.

This is just some of the history that New Jersey students will learn with the support of the Amistad Commission and enforcement by the New Jersey Department of Education. History teachers must be provided with the professional development and mentorship purposed to equip them with the historical knowledge, the pedagogical tools to teach it and a culturally competent philosophy to guide their daily practice in the classroom. Because equally as important as it is to teach our history is that we teach it properly and courageously with power and conviction.

Mississippi on Tuesday morning had 21 reported cases of new coronavirus, according to the state Department of Health.

New cases have been reported in Harrison, Hinds, Jackson and Leflore counties.

There were four additional cases in Hinds, raising the total in the county to six.

Leflore County now has three cases, up from one reported on Sunday.

Jackson County now has its first case.

Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, meanwhile, reported an additional case in Harrison County that is not being reported by the Health Department.

The Mississippi Health Department on Wednesday reported the state's first presumptive case of the novel coronavirus.

As of Tuesday morning, the department listed that 389 people have been tested. Also, a case previously reported as being in Pearl River County was from Hancock County, the department reported.

Gulfport Memorial reports cases in Harrison County

Kent Nicaud, CEO of Memorial in Gulfport, announced Tuesday that two cases had been confirmed by the Health Department, making them the first in Harrison County to be identified.

Per CDC guidelines, the patients were isolated, the hospital said in a release. The individuals were not hospitalized and were never inpatients at either Memorial or Stone County campuses. Each patient is at home recovering, self-quarantined.

Nicaud sais: “The patients felt ill and sought treatment early, which we have educated the community to do. They visited our clinics where our staff followed the CDC guidelines for suspected COVID-19 patients by isolating each quickly, taking samples safely and working with our state agencies for a diagnosis. The process worked. The patients are home and we are in contact with them to aid in their recovery. We expect to see more COVID-19 cases in our community and within our health care system.”

State of emergency declared

On Monday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced two executive orders that will activate the National Guard to keep health care workers safe at testing centers being set up across the state, send all non-essential state workers home, require schools to set up ""distance learning"" and continue to offer students free and reduced lunches.

Reeves said any state or local government employees that miss work due to the outbreak will receive paid leave.

Mississippi coronavirus: What state employees need to know

He said he hopes that businesses will follow the state's example in sending employees home and offering them paid leave.

Reeves also announced the closing of Mississippi casinos.

The biggest risk is that coronavirus cases in Mississippi overwhelm the health care system. He urged people to wash their hands and practice good hygiene.

""Be smart, be safe. Because, the reality is, while you may be healthy, this is about protecting Mississippi's most vulnerable. Even if you are healthy you are still need to protect your friends and your neighbors,"" Reeves said.

Reeves stressed the seriousness of the crisis. He said the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency considers the virus a ""level one"" disaster, which hasn't been seen since Hurricane Katrina.

Over the weekend, Reeves declared a state of emergency for Mississippi.

On Tuesday, the Mississippi Secretary of State's office announced it would close temporarily to help prevent the spread of the virus. The office will be closed until further notice.

Office staff will continue to respond to emails, answer calls and guide people through online resources, a news release said.

“We care deeply about the health and safety of all Mississippians, as well as our staff,” said Secretary of State Michael Watson. “Our mission is to provide the highest level of customer service, and that effort will continue during this unique and challenging time.”

Reeves warned Mississippians to avoid any large gatherings, including church services Sunday, and to ""use caution"" and not panic. Reeves also asked for Mississippi schools to close for at least a week. Most were on spring break last week. Dozens of school districts have announced additional closure plans, with some announcing closures of two weeks, including Madison and Rankin districts.

MSU, USM postponing graduation

Two of the state's largest universities said they planned on postponing graduation ceremonies in light of the possible spread of the virus.

Mississippi State University announced Tuesday afternoon the school plans to offer online courses for the remainder of the spring semester. It will also postpone graduation.

The university said in a news release that plans to honor MSU graduates will be discussed and revealed when the national emergency is concluded.

""Commencement is one of MSU’s most meaningful and cherished traditions, one that our students and their families have earned. As an institution, MSU remains committed to celebrating our graduates at a safe and appropriate time,"" the release said.

The University of Southern Mississippi posted to social media a similar message.

The university said graduation will not be held in May and that it is unlikely it will be held prior to the latter part of the summer, given the ongoing evolution of COVID-19.

""We are working as quickly as possible to identify an alternate date,"" the university said.

Non-essential government employees sent home

Reeves said Monday all non-essential state and local government employees will be sent home. It will be up to agencies to determine which employees are non-essential.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said non-essential Jackson city offices and government leased buildings will be closed and non-essential city employees will be required to work remotely. The Water and Sewer Business Administration will remain open.

Jatran buses are being cleaned nightly, Lumumba said, and drivers are being provided personal hygiene supplies. Residents should use online city services as much as possible.

All non-essential Hinds County employees will leave work at 5 p.m. Monday and not return until after March 30, Hinds County supervisors announced at a press conference Monday afternoon. All employees will be paid during the time off, said board president Robert Graham. It was not immediately known if the affected employees would lose sick days due to the break.

While non-essential employees will also be sent home from the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department, deputies will continue to patrol. Of those deputies, Sheriff Lee Vance said, “there’s nothing we can do to keep them absolutely safe, it’s basically the nature of the business.”

Visitation at the Raymond Jail has been limited to attorneys only until March 30, Vance said.

County offices, including justice court, will remain open, Graham said.

Graham said the reason for the March 30 date was because it’s “past the 14 day isolation period.” Surrounded by almost a dozen county officials in a room with approximately 35 people, Graham noted that earlier in the day the CDC recommended limiting gatherings to 10 people.

Graham said, to his knowledge, no county employees had called in sick due to coronavirus symptoms.

More COVID-19 cases reported

The Health Department on Friday confirmed two additional cases of the virus, a man and a woman, in Forrest County. The department has since stopped providing any details on patients.

One involves a woman over the age of 65, which is among the high risk demographics, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The department said in a news release that she had recently traveled to North Carolina.

Another reported case involves a woman in LeFlore County. She is self-isolating at home. Sunday's additional cases included one in Copiah County, two in Hinds County and one in Pearl River County.

The Rankin County School District posted on social media Sunday night that it would be providing ""grab and go"" lunches for free for any child 18 and under. While the student must be present to get a lunch, they do not have to be a student in the Rankin County School District.

Starting Tuesday, the lunches will be handed out at three schools via a drive thru line with more locations expected to be added. Parents can also purchase a lunch for $3.50. First responders in uniform can pick up a lunch for free.

Lunches can be picked up from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at McLaurin Elementary, Richland Upper Elementary and Pelahatchie Elementary.

The school district announced Saturday that schools would be closed though Friday, March 127.

In a separate effort, volunteers are providing a drop-off meal service for Jackson families in need, the People’s Advocacy Institute announced. Several organizations are partnering to provide breakfast and dinner for families through schools’ extended breaks. Meal drop-off operations are being guided by healthcare professionals, the release said, and volunteers will minimize one-on-one contact and group gatherings.

Call or text (615) 946-4197 to set up a meal drop-off location and time. The mobile meal hotline is being monitored 24 hours a day, according to the release.

Clinic opens to treat, test symptomatic people

A new Cough and Fever Clinic opening Wednesday at Hattiesburg Clinic's Cloverleaf Immediate Care facility will hopefully reduce the spread of new coronavirus and help those who may have symptoms of the disease without the worry of infecting others around them.

The clinic will be at Cloverleaf Medical Plaza, 5909 U.S. 49, in Hattiesburg.

Dr. Bryan Batson of Hattiesburg Clinic said the Cough and Fever Clinic will take walk-ins, but it is recommended that if people have questions about their symptoms to first contact their primary health care providers.

People without a primary care physician and those without insurance may also come to the clinic to be examined and if need be, tested. No one will be turned away for inability to pay.

Batson said people should not visit the clinic if they do not have symptoms, which include fever, a cough, runny nose, sore throat or in some cases difficulty breathing.

Dr. Rambod Rouhbakhsh with Forrest General Hospital said if the model is successful, other areas of the state might soon be developing similar facilities

Beware of scams, Attorney General warns

Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch urged people to be vigilant about scams and frauds during the emergency.

In a news release, Fitch’s office provided tips on how to protect yourself from scams:

Use trusted and official sources. Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website for information about the virus.

Don’t let anyone rush you into donating. Exercise caution when someone asks for donations in cash, gift card or money transfers. Check the Federal Trade Commission’s website for advice on how to donate wisely.

If you think you see price gouging then take a photo, including a time and date stamp of the price signs.

People who think they have been scammed during the coronavirus outbreak can contact the attorney general’s Consumer Protection Division at (601) 359-4230 or (800) 281-4418.

Fitch said in a statement: ""Emergencies bring out the best in some people, but sometimes they bring out the worst, too. It is important to remember there are people who are looking to take advantage of this time of uncertainty. If you suspect that someone is unfairly raising their prices to take advantage of the outbreak, you may be able to do something about it and our consumer protection team is ready to assist you with your questions.""

State universities switching to online courses

Mississippi's eight public universities will extend spring break a week, then switch to online classes, to inhibit the spread of coronavirus.

The state College Board made the announcement Thursday that universities would change their schedules for spring semester classes.

""The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff are paramount,"" Alfred Rankins Jr., Commissioner of Higher Education, said in a statement.

All eight universities are observing Spring Break this week or next and will extend the break an additional week to allow faculty members time to prepare to offer classes remotely.

Event cancellations in Capital City

On Monday, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced that gatherings of 50 or more people are now prohibited.

Other events across the state were being canceled, as state officials urged people not to have any events or gatherings with large numbers of people, including church services.

Out of an abundance of caution, Lumumba said, the city has postponed several events, including Tech JXN and the Fertile Grounds Expo.

Malls in metro to adjust hours

Northpark Mall announced on Tuesday that it would adjusting store hours beginning on Wednesday.

The new hours will be Monday-Thursday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Sundays from 12 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The food court will remain open and offer a pickup option and delivery services for customers.

Mississippi, federal court system changes

The Mississippi Supreme Court issued an order Sunday outlining changes due to coronavirus. All courts will remain open, but individual judges have the discretion to postpone any trials on their own docket scheduled through May 15, 2020. Courts shall not conduct any proceedings that require witnesses or parties to travel from an infected area or that involve vulnerable persons, according to the high court.

No more than 50 people are allowed in a courtroom at a given time, changing from the previously limited 200. Access to trials is limited to judges, attorneys, witnesses, security and other necessary people.

Jury summonses may not be sent to jurors which would be returnable to any date prior to May 18, 2020.

Through March 31, all non-essential civil and criminal cases set for a hearing or trial in any federal courthouse in the Southern District of Mississippi have been postponed.

However, Chief Judge Dan Jordan said initial appearance, arraignments, detention hearings, and issuance of warrants are essential, therefore, they will go on as scheduled.

It will be up to the presiding judge to determine during the period if any other court matter is essential and should go forward or whether the matter can be conducted via videoconference or telephone, Jordan said.

In the Northern District, all proceedings, civil and criminal, scheduled or typically undertaken in person should be continued or conducted by video or telephone conference to every extent possible, said Chief Judge Sharrion Aycock.

118,"Apr 13, 2020",Natural Resources Defense Council,"As Sea Level Rise Threatens Their Ancestral Village, a Louisiana Tribe Fights to Stay Put","Ten years ago, as news of the BP oil disaster reached Louisiana’s Grand Bayou Indian Village, Rosina Philippe dispatched her brother Maurice Phillips on a reconnaissance mission. Phillips pointed his flatboat toward the Gulf of Mexico and motored through a series of canals and inlets until he reached a fertile fishing ground called Bay Jimmy, eight miles from home. He returned with a passenger: a brown pelican, alive but slathered in petroleum.

Philippe and her brother belong to the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe. They live in their ancestral village, an hour’s drive south of New Orleans near the town of Port Sulphur. Most of the tribe’s estimated 400 members live elsewhere, but a remnant remains in Grand Bayou, a community that has shrunk over the years as its land has slowly slipped into the surrounding waters. The village consists of 14 homes and a nondenominational church. Surrounded by water, most of the buildings sit atop wooden pilings, and there are no roads to connect them. The houses line the bayou and can be reached only by boat.

For generations, the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha have relied on the fertility of the Mississippi River Delta. They catch seafood and forage for wild celery, green onions, and a leafy green called morelle noire. They used to forage for persimmons, too. They trapped muskrats, packing the meat in salt and preserving it in oak barrels. They hunted for deer and rabbits—and still hunt ducks—and grew vegetables in large backyard gardens. In recent decades, however, these resources have contracted. The tribe has withstood one environmental assault after another, standing its ground in a disappearing wetland.

As they scrambled to save the pelican (which they later turned over to a wildlife rescue center), Phillips told his sister that he saw other oiled birds but could wrangle only that one onto his boat. What’s more, Bay Jimmy was covered in thick, gooey crude. Nearly two months after the April 2010 disaster, then governor Bobby Jindal visited the same bay and declared that BP’s oil was “killing the marsh.”

The Deepwater Horizon explosion and resulting 87-day oil spill proved catastrophic for Grand Bayou. The community had just rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the area in 2005, and residents had returned in time for the 2010 commercial shrimping season. “A lot of guys, what little bit of cash they had, they invested into making repairs on their boats because they envisioned the seafood to come,” says Philippe, a tribal elder. The springtime waters brimmed with shrimp. “So, it was almost like the anticipation of Christmas morning.”

Except that Christmas never came. The oil spewing from BP’s open well about 5,000 feet below the Gulf’s surface shut down the nearby fisheries for months. Grand Bayou’s fleet remained docked long after officials insisted that Gulf seafood posed no health risk. The fishermen didn’t agree. “As long as they believed that it was unsafe to eat,” Philippe says, “they refused to go out and catch it, even though they were in dire straits financially.”

Now, with the 10th anniversary of the explosion approaching next week, the tribe is clear on two points. First, the BP disaster cannot be viewed in a vacuum. It is part of a litany of stresses that Grand Bayou has survived for decades, including the loss of more than 5,000 acres of fertile Delta land. And, second: They have no plans to leave.

“We’re resilient,” says Carmalita Sylve, who grew up in Grand Bayou, moved to Colorado after Hurricane Katrina, and returned to a rebuilt home in 2009. From the tribe’s mainland headquarters, she gestures outside toward a grass-lined bank where boats dock and neighbors come to fish. “It’s like this grass out here. You smoosh it down, but you know what? It will come right back. And that’s how we are. You think that you’re going to just overcome us with the different ways. But we’ll adapt.”

Fateful Omissions

The threats faced by the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha reflect, and amplify, what’s happening in vulnerable communities all along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. Since the 1930s, about 2,000 square miles—more than 10 times the land area of sprawling New Orleans—have disappeared from the state’s coastline. Grand Bayou lies outside the protection of the state’s levee system. It lies outside the planning loop, too: The tribe was not formally consulted when the state developed its most recent master plan for coastal restoration.

That $50 billion plan, published in 2017, is essentially a detailed wish list. At its core are large engineering projects like pipelines to pump sediment into degraded wetlands in order to elevate the land and restore the marshes. “What is in the plan is not necessarily funded,” says Stuart Brown, who oversees the plan’s development at the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA). Rather, he says, it’s a “prioritization effort.”

The master plan also lays out risk-reduction strategies for communities facing increased flooding. Depending on the projected flood levels and the type of building, it recommends one of three alternatives: floodproofing, elevation, or “voluntary acquisition.”

Nothing in the plan explicitly calls for the tribe’s, or anyone’s, relocation. But neither does it offer resources or a long-term vision for Grand Bayou to remain an intact village as the surrounding wetlands continue to erode. Members of the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha say they feel a tacit, and sometimes explicit, pressure to plan a future elsewhere.

That pressure, elders say, fails to consider the tribe’s connection to the bayou. It is so ancient, so sacred, that any discussion of resettlement evokes comparisons to the Trail of Tears. Grand Bayou predates the oil companies and the levee builders; predates the refineries and borrow pits that line the nearby highway; predates Louisiana statehood. The prospect of leaving feels, to them, like cultural erasure.

Place Markers

Last year a group of scientists, public officials, lawyers, and coastal residents met in New York City at a conference organized by Columbia University’s Earth Institute to discuss “managed retreat,” an idea that has gained traction in planning circles. The notion is that life along certain coastlines has grown untenable and that orderly relocation is the logical solution.

A handful of U.S. communities have already confronted the decision. After the 1993 Mississippi River floods inundated Valmeyer, Illinois, residents voted to rebuild their town 1.5 miles to the east and 400 feet up a bluff. Shishmaref, Alaska, an Iñpuiat village on a barrier island that is eroding from melting permafrost and sea ice, is currently waiting on federal funds to move to the mainland. (According to PRI’s The World, climate-change denialism has held up the money.)

Closer to home, the planned resettlement of Louisiana’s Isle de Jean Charles Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe, whose ancestral island has nearly disappeared, has been mired in a conflict over tribal sovereignty. The tribe’s leaders say they’re not being treated as co-collaborators—in fact, they learned about the state’s purchase of land for resettlement by reading a press release. State officials say they have tried to work with those leaders but are “not in a legal position” to acknowledge the sovereignty of a tribe that is not federally recognized.

Valmeyer, Shishmaref, and Isle de Jean Charles could be the vanguard of something bigger. The U.S. government’s 2018 National Climate Assessment envisioned the future relocation of “millions of people” as retreat from rising seas becomes an “unavoidable option.”

“That’s what the people in Miami are facing. That’s what I’m facing in New Orleans,” says Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy. Climate change, he says, will make some places uninhabitable, even if residents want to stay. “Sooner or later, they are going to be dealt a hand they cannot play.”

Among those attending the Columbia conference were representatives of four Louisiana tribes, who spoke together on a panel. Rosina Philippe was among them. Fewer phrases pique the Grand Bayou elder faster than “managed retreat.” Given the arc of U.S. history, she worries that it’s the rebranding of an old policy: making life-altering decisions about communities without their participation or consent.

“They’re couching it in such agreeable terms. ‘Managed retreat.’ Well, managed by whom?” Philippe asks. “We’ve seen so many instances of other people looking at indigenous populations and deciding they should go there, or they can’t go there, and thinking that they were doing the right thing. And we learn through the historic context that it was to the tribe’s detriment. But yet they continue to not learn from the past mistakes.”

To understand the depth of this sentiment, one must understand the value of place in Grand Bayou, where money is scarce but biological and social capital are ample. That sense of abundance stems from an era, within the memory of elders, when the village had dozens of households and looked very different.

“You see water back here, but all of this was ground,” says Carmalita Sylve.

“High ground,” says Philippe.

“You could walk probably just about almost to the Gulf of Mexico,” says Sylve.

When Sylve and Philippe were children, houses had yards, and there was enough land to raise goats and plant peach orchards. The wetlands provided nurseries for fish and shellfish. Add to that the game and foraged plants, and there was little reason to visit the mainland other than for staples like rice and flour.

Here, self-sufficiency meant interdependence. If someone’s bulkhead had loose planks, there would be an announcement at one of the tribe’s regular gatherings or from the pulpit at church. Neighbors would then make plans to fix it. Without ready access to physicians, even health care was a communal effort. The tribe had traiteurs, traditional healers, who used medicinal plants from the marshlands. Older residents talk about “making the veillée,” or holding vigil, at the home of sick neighbors: cooking, cleaning, and brewing coffee so the immediate relatives didn’t have to.

With a social fabric so deeply tied to the wetlands, it’s hard to separate identity from geography. “It’s like we’ve incorporated our very DNA into what’s around us in the land, the air, the water, the other life forms that share the space with us,” says Philippe. “We see ourselves as having our pail full because we have the history of cohabitation, the history of the knowledge of place, of belonging.” Leaving, she says, would upend that relationship. “We would be somewhere else, in a different place with an empty pail. And that’s a feeling almost like a death, like a bereftness.”

The fact that most of the tribe has already left doesn’t diminish that feeling. Loved ones return and pack their relatives’ houses for holidays, summer vacations, and biennial tribal reunions. Some own land in the village. “My grandkids, even though they were born in Tennessee, they claim Grand Bayou as their heritage,” says Geraldine Phillips Ancar, the village’s oldest resident. Ancar, who is in her eighties, co-pastors Grand Bayou’s Light Tabernacle Church with her husband, Bennie. When their youngest grandson, a U.S. Marine, comes to visit, he spends entire days exploring and photographing the wetlands.

Those who stay feel responsible for maintaining the village for the diaspora. “We’re like place markers on the table,” Philippe says, “waiting for everybody else to come and dine.”

Defeats of Engineering

About a decade ago, when he was working on his Ph.D. at the University of New Orleans, Matthew Bethel collaborated with Grand Bayou residents to map the 27-square-mile “livelihood base” where they fished, trapped, and hunted. He studied aerial photos and quantified the landscape changes over four decades.

Bethel calculated a net land loss of 5,449 acres—the shedding of vast productive habitat even before the BP spill soiled so much of what remained. In 1968 there were 2.62 land acres for every water acre. By 2009 that had fallen to 0.48 land acres. Bethel, now the associate executive director of research at Louisiana Sea Grant, published his findings in 2011 in the Journal of Coastal Research.

These losses, all along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, are the cumulative byproduct of humanity’s attempts to engineer the land. Starting in the 1930s, the state’s oil and gas industry cut 10,000 miles of canals into the Mississippi River Delta to transport drilling equipment and lay pipelines. Scientists say the canals destroy wetlands by funneling saltwater into freshwater marshes. That, in turn, kills the freshwater plants whose roots hold the land together. The “spoil banks,” piles of dredged material that run parallel to the canals, also interfere with the natural water flow. In addition, the leveeing of the Mississippi River, particularly after the Great Flood of 1927, has blocked sediment-rich water from overtopping the riverbank during floods. The levees impede the natural process of rebuilding wetlands as they subside, or sink.

There are other causes of land loss, too, including oil from the BP spill, which harmed root systems, and hurricanes. As the climate continues to change, scientists expect sea level rise to increase exponentially, compounding the problem. According to the state’s master plan, sea level rise on the Louisiana Gulf Coast could exceed six feet by 2100.

In Grand Bayou, Philippe says the phrase “land loss” underplays the damage. “That’s habitat loss,” she says. “Those are the nursery for the young shrimp and for the animals around us.” The wetlands also offer protection from storms. As they disappear, communities become more vulnerable. Some people leave for safer harbors.

When Hurricane Katrina hit, Grand Bayou residents hunkered down in boats near the small city of Belle Chasse. They stayed for months, cooking and doing laundry together. It took almost five years to reconstruct their homes with the help of church and community-development groups. By the time returning became an option, some had built new lives on the mainland.

“My husband would like to move back,” says Philippe’s younger sister, LaDonna Sylve, an artist visiting Grand Bayou from her home in Belle Chasse. “But my grandbabies are right there”—in Belle Chasse—“and they’re a big part of my life. I want to be near them, to nurture them and teach them some of the ways that we had here.”

Feats of Resilience

Since their return to Grand Bayou in 2010, the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe has experimented with adaptations they hope will help them survive climate change, rising waters, and hurricanes.

They’ve turned a barge into a floating home. They’ve built portable gardens in canoes and small boats called pirogues. They’re working with the nonprofit Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana to protect sacred sites with reefs built from oyster shells recycled from New Orleans restaurants. Such reefs not only protect against erosion but also create new oyster habitat.

The tribe has also advocated for a low-tech coastal restoration project: backfilling those canals that were dug by oil and gas companies. In a 2018 study, coastal scientists R. Eugene Turner and Giovanna McClenachan concluded that filling the canals with spoil-bank material “could be a dramatically cost-effective and proven long-term strategy” for reversing land loss.

The scientists estimated that backfilling all the canals would cost about $335 million, less than 1 percent of the state’s $50 billion coastal master plan. “It’s really cheap. You can’t beat it,” says Turner, a professor of oceanography and coastal sciences at Louisiana State University. And yet, “if you go through the master plan and look for the word backfilling, you won’t find it.” (This is true.)

Brown, the CPRA official, agrees that backfilling works. But he also calls Turner’s paper “a little bit hyperbolic” and says that the state’s plan focuses on higher-impact projects.

The tribe is particularly worried about one of those projects: the $1 billion Mid-Barataria Diversion, which would add a series of gates to a Mississippi River levee 15 miles from Grand Bayou. Those gates would allow sediment and freshwater through, nourishing the wetlands and building an estimated 30,000 acres. According to a 2017 study, however, the diversion could increase flooding in Grand Bayou as it enhances wetlands elsewhere. CPRA’s Brown calls flooding a “reasonable concern” and says the state is preparing an analysis.

Beyond specific projects, Grand Bayou residents see a bigger problem with Louisiana’s master plan: When it was last updated, in 2017, they were never officially consulted. “People are making plans for our lives,” says Philippe. “And they’re not letting us self-determine and be a part of that conversation.” While individual members have met with CPRA to discuss specific concerns, all the tribe can do, she says, is speak at public meetings and submit written comments. These are inefficient ways to address existential policy concerns.

The coastal agency did convene a “community focus group” as it developed the 2017 plan, which included representatives from 11 organizations. They included three tribes that the state of Louisiana officially recognizes, though the federal government does not. (Three individual members of the focus group described it as perfunctory. Sandy Ha Nguyen, executive director of Coastal Communities Consulting, a nonprofit serving fishing families and related small businesses, called it a “waste of time.”) The Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha, who lack even state recognition, were not invited.

CPRA’s Brown acknowledges this communication shortfall. “I think that is a fair complaint,” he says. “We did have meetings with several tribes. Grand Bayou is not on that list.” As the state prepares to revise its master plan in 2023, “we are trying to be more intentional about how we reach out—not only to the tribe but to many folks who have not been involved in the process.”

Even open communication has limits, though. Coastal planning involves large state and federal bureaucracies with rigid policy options. Creative solutions like the ones Grand Bayou wants to develop—houses on barges, for example—are typically off the table.

“Nobody’s talked to them about innovative ways to stay,” says Cyn Sarthou, executive director of Healthy Gulf, a New Orleans–based nonprofit. “It’s just ‘You have to fit into our model, or you have to leave.’”

Brown concedes that the state can only consider conventional solutions, because government funding comes with strings. “They are 100 percent correct that programs that fund that work are not going to be nimble,” he says. “That’s a very legitimate criticism.” But he reiterates that no one is forcing the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha to relocate. “We don’t have a forever solution, but we don’t believe it’s unreasonable that Grand Bayou can continue to exist for 30 or 50 years,” he says. (The 25-year flood maps are ambiguous, but Grand Bayou appears to straddle the line between elevation and voluntary acquisition.) Any longer is beyond the state’s planning horizon, Brown notes, and the latter part of the century is likely to bring more land loss, sea level rise, and storm surge.

Coexistence

Grand Bayou’s biggest building is Light Tabernacle Church. Its size mirrors the importance of religious life here. “People still have that desire to put God first in their life,” says Ancar, the pastor. Inside is one of the tribe’s greatest treasures: a set of stained-glass windows depicting life on the bayou. There are images of shrimp boats, a burial site, and wildlife like a crab and an alligator, plus a large, abstract triptych suggesting a sunset over the marsh.

The story behind the stained glass tells a bigger story about place and resilience. The windows were produced by stained-glass artist Mary White, whose father, geographer Gilbert F. White, was the founder of the University of Colorado’s Natural Hazards Center. Until his death in 2006, he believed that behavioral changes, rather than building ever more levees and dams, were the best ways for humans to coexist with flooding.

The Natural Hazards Center convenes an annual workshop. At one of these events, a Grand Bayou resident named Paul Sylve approached the pioneering geographer and serenaded him in Louisiana French as a way of honoring his work. Mary White witnessed this tribute to her father and was moved. After Hurricane Katrina, she offered to craft the windows of the new church under construction. Grand Bayou residents provided drawings and photographs, and three young women from the tribe traveled west to help with the design.

Traditional built-in stained glass made no sense for the village; the next hurricane could level the church. The windows needed a bayou-appropriate adjustment. “What do you do with your treasure if you know that you’re housing it in an impermanent structure?” says Philippe. “You make it movable.” That’s what White created. The smaller images hang in front of the windows but are not permanently attached. The nine-foot-wide triptych is set into a light box over the pulpit and can be detached in sections.

The removable windows, which depict the tribe’s deep roots, embody Grand Bayou’s two competing realities: The tribe intends to stay. And, true to Gilbert White’s message, it recognizes that fragile landscapes require adaptation.

This is nothing new, Philippe says. Since her grandparents’ days, the tribe has adopted new home designs, new clothing, new motorized boats. Philippe knows that other communities are thinking about how to coexist with coastal erosion. “Those designs exist. We just need to find them and incorporate them in the new norm,” she says. “We intend to exhaust every adaptation designed in our quest to stay.”

119,"Sep 13, 2018",University of Rochester,Top investment lawyer presents ‘a new mindset’ on women and leadership,"At one point Diane Ambler ’71 started writing a book, a memoir of sorts. Every chapter began with a quotation of something that somebody had said to her.

But there was a hitch. Some of it was outright unprintable, all of it inappropriate, often demeaning. Ambler, who had graduated from Rochester in 1971, was trying to prove herself as a young lawyer in financial and investment law, a male bastion in the early 1980s when she first arrived on the scene.

“It was an outlet for my anger,” she admits. Eventually, she abandoned the book idea. “I guess I became less angry,” Ambler says. “Once I started writing it all down I realized it wasn’t the focus of what I was trying to achieve. In one’s career one has to be strategic how one spends one’s time. And anger is a waste of time.”

Clearly, the Jersey shore native has spent her time well.

Ambler became a pioneer in mutual funds governance. Today, some 40 years later, she tells her stories punctuated by hearty laughter. A highly experienced practitioner in financial institutions regulation and federal securities law, Ambler regularly makes prestigious lists of best lawyers in America and the world’s leading women in business law. In 2001, she moved her established practice to the international firm of K&L Gates, headquartered in Washington, D.C.

She’s the first to admit that she couldn’t have done it alone. That’s one of the reasons she likes being a mentor for young professionals—male and female. She is a member of the executive boards of both the Women in Law Empowerment Forum and the National Association of Women Lawyers.

As a young lawyer, Ambler says, she noticed that most of her male colleagues in securities law were preoccupied with capital formation and deal making. Ambler instead moved into the much less sexy mutual funds law. At that time a nascent field with very few experienced practitioners, it proved fertile ground for Ambler to make her mark.

A new mindset On Monday, September 17, Diane Ambler ’17 will be on campus to speak about “Women as Leaders: A New Mindset” in the Feldman Ballroom in Douglass Commons at 3 p.m. In her talk, part of an Arts, Science & Engineering discussion on topical challenges, Ambler will speak about historical changes and work that remains to be done in the area of women and leadership; how women see themselves as thought leaders; and how institutions are adjusting to these changes. The event is free and open to all students, faculty, and staff, and will be followed by a reception.

“Because of the complexities of these laws and the need to develop an expertise, I had a leg up having started early in this business. So, while the men were out doing deals I was learning the 40 Act [the Investment Company Act of 1940, part of the backbone of US financial regulation]. I became a leader in my field simply because of my tenure.”

At times her rise was lonely. Back then, she says, women were working in “parallel play.” They just didn’t see one another. “We simply didn’t know that there were a lot of women with the same struggles, trying to deal with the same issues.”

Needless to say, her career took hard work and dedication. But sometimes, she says, it simply took a leap of faith, even if opportunities came knocking at inopportune times. For Ambler that pivotal moment arrived in her early 40s. The American Bar Association invited her to chair their Investment Companies and Investment Advisers Subcommittee—a prestigious offer. But Ambler’s first impulse was to turn it down. She had just joined a large, international law firm to develop and lead their new 40 Act practice at a time when the mutual funds industry was beginning to explode. Ambler also was a single mom with a toddler at home.

“I have a lot on my plate. I do not have time for that,” she recalls thinking. “It’s a terrible idea!”

When she mentioned the offer to a male colleague, however, he simply assumed she’d take it. That assumption got her thinking. Are there ways to make it work?

She did. Partially it was the realization that she didn’t need to be one of the firm’s top billers in order to succeed and that many of the 75 percent of partners who fell below the top quartile of billers were highly successful within the firm. And she hired a live-in nanny.

Taking the ABA’s offer turned out to be one of her best professional decisions, she says in hindsight.

“It completely accelerated my career in a way that I never would have anticipated, because it gave me exposure to everyone in the field.” Apart from giving her leadership opportunities in all the critical, developing legal issues, heading up the committee gave her a voice to appear before the regulators. Simply put, “it gave me a platform to develop my career.”

A circuitous route into law

Like many, if not most, advanced professionals, her path was by no means linear. When she graduated from the University of Rochester in 1971, college-educated women, despite their academic credentials, were routinely asked in job interviews how fast they could type. Ambler, who had studied math and physics at Rochester, graduated with a psychology degree. Initially she lacked career focus, she admits.

After landing serendipitously in the real estate business, Ambler noticed that tricky real estate questions often ended up with lawyers. Then, in 1974, the real estate market cratered. Ambler thought long and hard about her next move.

Four years later, with a newly minted JD from Villanova under her belt, she headed to Jackson, Mississippi, where she worked as a law clerk for the Honorable Charles Clark on the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, Louisiana.

“It might just as well have been another country,” she says of her Deep South experience. The judge at one point had been told he should branch out and hire Yankee and female law clerks. Being able to work in the federal courts system proved a valuable experience throughout her career.

Her year in Mississippi and Louisiana is one reason she tells mentees to take chances and plunge right in.

“We fixed the women, now we have to look at the institutions,” she says. That entails helping men understand how to relate to professional women in the era of the #MeToo movement, while simultaneously figuring out ways to prevent women from leaving the workplace, just as their careers begin to take off. At times, Ambler wonders if the movement will be able to keep up its momentum.

She works to make sure it does. More than fifteen years ago, Ambler began building a women’s group at her law firm, which employs some 2,000 lawyers worldwide. Many of the initiatives developed by this group have since been adopted as a firm-wide vision to help their female lawyers succeed.

120,"Jan 16, 2020",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Ole Miss vs Mississippi State: Was Lane Kiffin or Mike Leach the better hire?,"CLOSE

It's only January, but it's never too soon to start talking about a rivalry game.

In this week's edition of the Clarion Ledger Ole Miss mailbag, we answer questions about the biggest news of the week, which happens to be about what happened in Starkville, not Oxford.

We will make arguments for whether Ole Miss or Mississippi State made the better coaching hire, discuss how Mike Leach and Lane Kiffin will recruit in Mississippi and then touch briefly on basketball.

As always, if you ever have questions you'd like to submit for the mailbag, email them to nsuss@gannett.com or tweet them to our beat writer at @nicksuss.

The big question

Question: Was the Mike Leach hire at Mississippi State better than the Lane Kiffin hire at Ole Miss? --Travis Sigh

Well, Travis, we likely won't get a proper answer to this question for another four or five years. The honest truth is probably that both schools made good hires but neither hire immediately elevates either school to a championship level. But that opinion doesn't make for a compelling column.

So let's outline the arguments for both Kiffin and Leach. At the end, I'll let you — the humble reader — decide which argument is better.

The Kiffin argument

In Kiffin, Ole Miss has hired a coach with a championship pedigree. He has worked as an assistant on three national championship-winning staffs and won two conference championships as the head coach at Florida Atlantic. Two of his mentors include Pete Carroll and Nick Saban, two of the defining college football coaches of this century.

On top of that, Kiffin has a familiarity with the SEC from his three years at Alabama and his one-year stint as head coach at Tennessee. His time as Alabama's offensive coordinator proved his offense can work in the SEC. And his willingness to change that scheme depending on his personnel makes for an easier adjustment when playing with a different regime's recruits.

Finally, Kiffin's brand and confident attitude fits the Ole Miss fanbase and the Oxford personality well.

The Leach argument

In Leach, Mississippi State has hired a coach with a pedigree of production. Leach hasn't coached on a conference championship-winning staff since 1996 at Valdosta State, but he has changed the way offense is played in college and professional football.

In 18 years as a head coach, Leach's offenses have led the FBS in passing yards per game 10 times. Shredding the Big 12 and the Pac-12 is one thing, but Leach's scheme has also produced in the SEC. In 1998, Leach coached Tim Couch to a season with 4,275 passing yards, an SEC record that stood until LSU's Joe Burrow passed it this year.

Leach also has a track record of success and has twice shown he's willing to stay at a school to make it successful.

Beyond this, Leach has uniqueness on his side. Few SEC teams ever have to prepare for the pure, unfiltered Air Raid offense Leach will bring to Mississippi State. Opponents might find it more difficult to prepare for Mississippi State because of this.

And finally, Leach is also a good fit for Starkville. Kiffin's personality fits the culture of Oxford, but Leach's personality is perfect for Starkville. Leach gives off a down-home, blue-collar local boy personality. He appreciates nature and discipline. He likes to walk to work and has already complimented the cleanliness of Mississippi State's campus. Mississippi State fans have fallen in love with him just as much as Ole Miss fans have fallen in love with Kiffin.

The recruiting angle

Question: Can Leach recruit from Starkville? He eventually did at Texas Tech. Lane will recruit well at Ole Miss. -- @rpmjrOM on Twitter

Neither Leach nor Kiffin has directly emphasized in-state recruiting in their short tenures.

After the early signing period, Kiffin said he wanted to recruit like a national program. That means getting the players he and his staff identify as the best available, regardless of regional affiliation. Only if players from Mississippi are the best available or as good as players from other states will Kiffin and his staff consider them.

Leach, meanwhile, spoke at his introductory press conference about being a regional recruiter. He described the 350-mile radius from Starkville as the most fertile recruiting grounds in the country. And sure, that includes every inch of Mississippi. But it also includes Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville, Birmingham, Memphis and Pensacola, Florida.

Since Leach has never coached in this region before, it's hard to say how his recruiting style will translate. That said, Washington State ranked in the bottom five in the Pac-12 in recruiting in all eight of his seasons in Pullman, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. He still went to six bowl games. So the success of Leach's teams may not be particularly dependent on recruiting.

It'd honestly be a surprise if Leach out-recruited Kiffin. Kiffin's FAU classes ranked first, third and first in the Conference USA by the 247Sports composite rankings, and he built his staff to include nationally regarded recruiters like Chris Partridge and D.J. Durkin.

But how much will recruiting matter if Mississippi State has the schematic advantage under Leach?

More: Mike Leach, Lane Kiffin bring new flavor to Ole Miss, Mississippi State rivalry

A basketball thought

Question: This basketball team clearly has multiple issues, but how much is it missing Luis Rodriguez? -- @Ehutto on Twitter

There's definitely some of that. Luis Rodriguez was supposed to be the glue guy for Ole Miss basketball this year, passing and rebounding from the three-guard spot much in the same way Terence Davis did last season.

Without him, Ole Miss hasn't found a consistent middle guy for the lineup. Putting K.J. Buffen and Blake Hinson on the floor together has created defensive issues. Franco Miller, Austin Crowley and Dude Collum don't look ready yet. Bryce Williams has battled injuries.

More: Lane Kiffin's coaching staff at Ole Miss built from some of 2015's best teams

Ole Miss coach: Our complete coverage of the arrival of Lane Kiffin

Rodriguez solves some of these issues by putting a role player in a role player's position. But that might not solve Ole Miss' offensive issues, which are the bigger problems now. Unless Rodriguez would've been scoring 12 points a game, bringing him back right now wouldn't fix everything wrong with this Ole Miss team.

Business 2021's Best Cities for Outdoor Jobs If you love the outdoors LawnStarter released its 2021 Best Cities for Outdoor Jobs report Reply

Among the best cities for outdoor jobs ranking 34th is Grand Rapids Michigan (Image Credit (GlacierNPS/flickr))

Would you rather be working outside in nature than indoors punching a time clock? Forest rangers, landscapers, and so many others who work outdoors prefer to do their jobs amid the fresh air, sunshine, and wide open spaces.

Outdoor jobs also have their challenges -- delivering the mail in the cold or installing a roof in the heat. But not every city is fertile ground for outdoor careers like gardening, pool cleaning, and ski instructing.

That's why LawnStarter took stock of the outdoor employment landscape, to bring you its 2021 Best Cities for Outdoor Jobs report. They compared the 200 largest employment markets in the U.S. across 26 key factors — from outdoor job opportunities to cost of living to average daily temperature.

Check out the winners (and losers), followed by some highlights and lowlights from their report. Highlights and Lowlights:

Out and About in the Southwest: Arizona dominated our ranking, with four cities in the top 10. While not topping the charts in any single category, Scottsdale, Tempe and other Copper State cities earned high marks in opportunity metrics, such as labor force participation, and in safety metrics, such as health insurance coverage.

While not topping the charts in any single category, Scottsdale, Tempe and other Copper State cities earned high marks in opportunity metrics, such as labor force participation, and in safety metrics, such as health insurance coverage. Wet in the Washington Wilds: Washington is another surprising winner with three cities in our top 10. The Evergreen State is known for being wet, but with a high transit score, a high minimum wage, and no state income tax, its cities are a pretty good place to settle in for your new outdoor career. For example, Seattle — at No. 3 — didn't do well on that rainy metric, but it outperformed in opportunity and affordability metrics.

California — Almost: Many California cities did well in the outdoor job opportunities metric, with six entries in the top 10. Despite this, these locales finished mid-range overall. Here's why: Cities with a multitude of outdoor opportunities like Fullerton performed poorly on other measures such as natural hazards, air quality, and of course, cost of living.

It's not difficult to see why: Cities such as Jackson have a low minimum wage, too many extremely hot days, and well above-average amounts of precipitation. Key takeaway: While we all would love a little more time outdoors, most of us would rather not spend it in a muggy swamp.

122,"Oct 27, 2020",SouthBMore.com,GoFundMe Launched to Help Save The 8×10 in Federal Hill,"The owners of The 8×10 live music venue in Federal Hill have launched a GoFundMe to raise money to keep this longtime Federal Hill business afloat. The 8×10 has been open in Federal Hill since 1983, but it has been closed since March 13th due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The GoFundMe aims to raise $100,000 and has already raised almost $40,000 just a day after it was launched. From the GoFundMe:

Unfortunately, it has come to this. The 8×10 needs your help.

For those that don’t know about The 8×10, we are a live music venue in Baltimore, Md. Under various owners, the location in Federal Hill neighborhood has been providing a home for live music since 1983. My wife Abigail Janssens and myself, Brian Shupe have owned and operated it since 2005.

The 8×10 is legendary for its intimacy, its pristine sound, and most of all, its rabid and fiercely loyal fanbase. We get told all the time by bands that we are their favorite venue east of the Mississippi. We have poured our souls into the venue to live up to those standards and provide a fertile ground for bands and audiences to connect seamlessly.

The 8×10 shut its doors on March 13th 2020 and has been dark ever since. Being an entertainment venue, we are going to be the last industry to recover. While bars and restaurants have been open for several months, we just have been permitted to open at 25% capacity.

The problem breaks down into two main issues. Safety and Revenue.

SAFETY ISSUES

The last thing we are going to do is create a situation where our family of customers, bands, and employees get sick. We have been going back and forth about when would it be safe to open, when the outbreak at The White House happened, that put everything into perspective. How fast it spread, How many people were infected from one little gathering. And that was outdoors. The 8×10 is a small venue. There is hardly any way to socially distance. Even with lower capacity, masks, temperature checks, if someone unknowingly came to a show, The 8×10 would be a super spreader. We couldn’t live with that.

REVENUE ISSUES

Right now we can open at 25% capacity. Do I want to put my staff at risk of bringing home COVID-19 to their children or elderly parents for 25% of their usual tips? Our doorman is going to have to interact with every single patron multiple times a night, what kind of risk is that? But that isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. Where are we going to get bands? Bands aren’t touring yet out of fear and simply not being able to find enough venues that are allowed to open. Is a band that usually plays to 300 people and makes a couple thousand dollars going to be able to cover the exact same expenses from 25% of their normal ticket sales? And are you the public going to risk coming to shows? What should we do? Should we start charging four times as much for the tickets to make up the difference? We just can’t stomach charging $60 to our faithful patrons for the same show they normally pay $15 to attend. There are no easy answers.

COST OF DOING BUSINESS

Meanwhile, we are still paying our expenses to the tune of $15,000 a month. Our rent alone is $10k a month. Every month. Our landlord has been very generous to offer us some relief and has promised us he will do everything he can to ensure The 8×10 survives this, but he is struggling too. The 8×10 is all about doing the right thing, and we can’t run out on our commitment to him or any of our other vendors and monthly responsibilities. Rent, Gas & Electric, Insurance, Telephone, Internet, yada yada yada.

We were lucky. We got an emergency relief loan through the government and we have been able to meet our responsibilities up to now. And we can still make it but probably only to the end of the year. But this is a loan, not a grant. It is not a forgivable package, but a loan. That means after working so hard and struggling to serve the community for 15 years, once we had finally pulled our head above water, COVID-19 struck and derailed our retirement plans and now were are once again in debt. The $150,000 dollars that has been keeping The 8×10 from bankruptcy is going to have to be repaid and it is going to come out of Abigail’s and my pocket. It’s the cost of doing business and we know it. But the government is not helping our industry. Live music venues, movie theaters, theaters for plays and musicals are all suffering the most and going to be the last industry to recover. Since there is no second round of loans or aid on the horizon, it has come to this. We have to turn to the people that come to, and play at The 8×10 for help.

We hate the fact that we are asking for charity, but if comes down to begging or letting The 8×10 disappear due to some pandemic…We have no pride. We will do whatever it takes to keep The 8×10 alive for our community of music lovers. There is no shame in that. If there was another way, believe me we would be doing it.

OUR GOAL

Honestly, we know 2020 has been a screw job on everybody and finances are tough for everyone. We are just hoping that Many Hands Make Light Work. There have been hundreds of thousands of people that have come through the doors of The 8×10. If we can spread the financial burden of keeping The 8×10 solvent over all the people who have come and had their minds blown by the magic coming off the stage, celebrated with their friends a marriage, birth, promotion, birthday, or just that it is a Friday night. If we can spread it out over the thousands of bands that have played there over the years and told us how much they love The 8×10. If everyone who has ever been touched by what The 8×10 does can just donate what they can afford then the burden won’t seem so heavy.

Our bare minimum goal would be to put six more months of expenses into savings. Maybe just maybe by then we will have a vaccine or some semblance of our normal lives back. But in March we were sure it would be over by June. In August we were saying it has to be better by October, yet nothing has changed.

Whatever we can raise we will be grateful for. I can tell you that every cent of the money will go to expenses at The 8×10 first and foremost. If by some miracle we are able to open soon, 100% of the remainder of the money will go to paying back the $150k loan.

We need your help. We need you to spread this website to every person you know. Do you have a contact with any of the big bands that played The 8×10 back when they were coming up? Send them a link, ask them to give back if they can. Do you have a contact with a music magazine or online community? Represent for us and tell them what we stand for and ask if they can throw us a few.

Please, please know that we are only asking for you to give an amount that makes sense for your situation. Every donation will add up, so please don’t try and be a hero and end up putting strain on your situation.

This is such a horrible situation. We have put 15 years of our blood, sweat, tears, and love into The 8×10. And you have put the same effort into coming and supporting us by seeing show after show. None of us want The 8×10 to go under.

That means there are many millions of people walking the streets of this country who believe that Satan-worshipping pedophile Democrats secretly rule the world, injecting themselves with adrenochrome, an elixir extracted from the children they abduct. Wayfair had been forced to issue statements denying that traffickers conceal children in the cabinets it manufactures.

Georgia has just gone one better than Louisiana by electing dedicated QAnonist Marjorie Taylor Greene to Congress. Another congresswoman-elect, gun-toting Lauren Boebert of Colorado, has somewhat backed off her earlier endorsement of QAnon.

With Clay Higgins about to begin his third term in Congress, Louisiana is no slouch when it comes to political paranoia, however. Higgins has voiced support for two gangs of deluded right-wingers — the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers.

Boebert won election after denouncing the incumbent in the primary as insufficiently devoted to President Donald Trump. Greene, meanwhile, believes Trump is uniquely qualified to rid the world of the cabal that runs our lives from the shadows. The QAnon faithful believe that, when Trump delivers mankind from bondage, cabal members will be shipped off to Guantanamo Bay and hanged.

Greene, whose many racist slurs include denouncing the Jewish financier and philanthropist George Soros as a Nazi bent on world domination, may be a repugnant spokeswoman for a deranged movement, but she is Trump's cup of tea. He has called her a “future Republican star,” and lauded QAnon as “people that love our country.” The FBI takes a different view, having dubbed QAnon a “domestic terrorist threat.”

President-elect Joe Biden is naturally at a odds with Trump over QAnon, having whimsically suggested last week that its adherents have a screw loose. He said they should take advantage of the mental health benefits provided by the Affordable Care Act, which Trump was hoping the U.S. Supreme Court would throw out.

Some fans must wonder why Trump doesn't just make it happen, for QAnon has taken on the trappings of a religion and he is widely credited with divine powers. When Trump was sick with the coronavirus, Brendan Dilley, a radio talk show host who doubles as a “Make-America-Great-Again life coach,” predicted he would soon recover on account of his “god-tier genetics.” From whom gods inherit their genes must remain imponderable.

It would be folly to write off QAnon believers as no-account suckers, however. There are so many of them that they must run the IQ gamut. What they believe may seem incompatible with sweet reason and scientific principle, but the same applies to the tenets of any faith. A Pew survey found that 80% of Americans believe in miracles, so whatever objections may be raised to QAnon, its adherents cannot be accused of unusual credulity.

Their emergence is alarming because their high priests do not preach peace and reconciliation. QAnon believers take their cues from a mysterious online source, purportedly a high-ranking government official with all the inside dope on the domestic threats to the American way of life. QAnon's version of Armageddon is the Storm, when Trump will vanquish the evildoers and — you've guessed it — make America great again.

Until that wonderful day arrives, militias inspired by QAnon and similar paranoid movements are evidently prepared to stage violent resistance to the government they believe is oppressing them. Six militiamen right now await trial on charges of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Trump's “Liberate Michigan” tweets in response to Whitmer's coronavirus lockdown order was a clear incitement to thuggery, and very much in character. He is too busy fabricating tales of election fraud to contradict goofy conspiracy theories.

125,"Jul 15, 2020",Yahoo News,"Mississippi Is Replacing Its State Flag, But a Confederate Emblem Still Flies Over Georgia","In late June, as many people across the United States took a renewed look at the nation’s history of racism, legislators in Mississippi voted yea on House Bill 1796, replacing the state flag. With that, theirs became the last state to remove a flying Confederate battle emblem from above their statehouse. The landslide vote, with 92 of 115 Representatives and 37 of 51 Senators opting for removal, was resoundingly heralded as a massive step forward for American equality.

However, even though the well-known design of a blue X with white stars criss-crossing a field of deep red, which featured heavily on Mississippi’s now-former state flag, often gets referred to as “the Confederate flag,” it wasn’t—and even though many people thought this was the last lingering official state symbol of the Confederacy, it isn’t.

The actual Confederate flag is almost identical to the current state flag of Georgia, and that’s not a coincidence. It was a deliberate choice, a way of forcing an emblem of the Confederacy onto the public by stealthily using a design that fewer people recognize, and it worked. A recent New York Times article on the removal of the Mississippi flag, when referencing other state flags with designs some consider to be “obliquely referencing Confederate iconography” did not call out the symbol in use by Georgia. The official Confederate flag, hiding in plain sight, still flies over an American capitol building.

When the Southern states decided to secede in 1861, their Provisional Congress established a Committee on the Flag and Seal to decide on a new flag design. The Committee leader, William Porcher Miles, was inundated with letters from citizens and leaders expressing attachment to the Stars and Stripes of the United States. They were loath to give up their favorite symbol of freedom, which was ironic given their primary goal was preservation of slavery. As a compromise, the Confederate flag-makers settled on an imitation design they called the Stars and Bars: three horizontal stripes, two red and one white, with a blue corner in the upper left containing a circle of 13 brilliant stars.

Story continues

But in their efforts to make the flag similar to the American banner, the designers inadvertently did too good of a job. During the first major battle of the war, the First Battle of Bull Run, commanding officers couldn’t tell which flag was which when they hung limply on their poles. At least one Confederate regiment fired on another, and multiple officers left written records of the confusion.

Thus, the Confederate battle flag was born. Even hanging on a pole, the new banner was easy to distinguish from the Stars and Stripes, and flag-related conundrums faded from combat. The battle flag too largely disappeared in the decades after the end of the Civil War—but, like clockwork, each time Black Americans began to agitate for less systemic oppression, it popped back up again, a not-so-subtle symbol of rebellion against the fight for equality. In 1894, during the ramp-up to the formal Supreme Court legalization of segregation in 1896, Mississippi incorporated it into their state flag. When the Supreme Court ended school segregation with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Georgia replied with a bill adding a large battle flag emblem to their state’s banner.

Now, in the face of new protests for racial equality, one at a time the Confederate symbols have come back down. However, some stealthy racists of the past have ensured that, so far, at least one symbol has remained overlooked by the national conversation.

Georgia shrank the battle flag emblem from its dominant position on its state flag in 2001 in a move led by the Georgia House Black Caucus and supported by Democratic then-Governor Roy Barnes. However, direct backlash from conservative white voters helped lead to Barnes’ ouster from office. In 2003 the new leadership swiftly replaced the 2001 flag with a second, more clandestine, but nonetheless gigantic emblem of the Confederacy, a so-called “compromise flag.” The compromise flag, which is still Georgia’s current state flag, is literally the Stars and Bars Confederate flag, but with a small yellow insignia added in the center of the circle. At the time, members of the Georgia Black caucus supported the move as being some version of progress, although admittedly imperfect, stating that at least this symbol of the Confederacy had not been used as commonly to intimidate and terrify Black Americans during the Civil Rights era.

Now we have made even more progress, and the current reckoning should not overlook the “compromise” for which activists had to settle in the past. The Confederate government existed solely to keep Black Americans in unwilling bondage, and its primary symbol still flies over every resident of the state of Georgia. If Americans want to remove what is truly the last Confederate flag, Georgia will have to follow in the footsteps of Mississippi.

126,"Jan 7, 2021",The Detroit News,"After years of work, Abrams takes victory lap in Georgia","Atlanta – Stacey Abrams spent years crisscrossing Georgia, working to convince Democratic leaders, donors and prospective candidates that a vast, untapped well of potential voters could upend Republican domination in the state. There was no national media spotlight or constant praise from national political players to ease the slog.

That’s over now.

After disappointments including her own narrow defeat for governor in 2018, Abrams is being credited with laying the organizational groundwork that helped Democrats capture the state’s two Senate seats. Those victories this week propelled the party into the Senate majority and follow Joe Biden’s win in November, the first time a Democratic presidential candidate has taken the state since 1992.

The turnabout leaves Abrams as perhaps the nation’s most popular, influential Democrat not in elected office. It gives the 47-year-old voting rights advocate considerable momentum for whatever comes next – most likely a rematch with Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022.

“I think what’s next for Stacey is whatever Stacey wants to be next,” said Leah Daughtry, a former chief of staff at the Democratic National Committee. “She’s clearly demonstrated her political prowess, her ability to plan – Georgia didn’t happen overnight.”

Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Noam Lee previewed the potential matchup in a brief statement: “Gov. Kemp, you’re next. See you in 2022.”

Former President Barack Obama called Georgia “a testament to the tireless and often unheralded work of grassroots organizing” and credited Abrams with “resilient, visionary leadership.”

The praise came fast and furious, especially from her fellow Black women who, collectively, saw their stock rise in Democratic politics in 2020 after spending decades as an underappreciated anchor of the party. “Stacey Abrams (that’s the tweet),” wrote Karine Jean-Pierre, incoming deputy White House press secretary.

“She’s earned her spot as a party elder and a party wise-woman,” said Karen Finney, one of Abrams’ advisers in her 2018 campaign.

Former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean called her the “LeBron James of American politics.”

“She has just an enormous amount of talent, and the ability to focus that talent in a very intense way,” Dean said. “And so when you get somebody like that, of course you want them elevated as much as possible.”

On Monday, Abrams had stood at Democrats’ election-eve rally where Biden gushed that “nobody in America has done more” for voting rights and the party.

“Stacey, you’re changing Georgia,” Biden said. “You’ve changed America.”

Abrams, a Mississippi native with degrees from historically Black Spelman College and Yale Law School, attempted to deflect.

“Let’s celebrate the extraordinary organizers, volunteers, canvassers and tireless groups that haven’t stopped going since November,” Abrams tweeted as the Rev. Raphael Warnock’s victory became apparent. “Across our state, we roared. A few miles to go … but well done!”

But Georgia’s shift in 2020 is a reflection of her willingness to see a new coalition in Democratic politics – and to fight even her party’s old guard in the process.

“This is a lot of work, but people need to believe in building multiracial, multigenerational, geographically diverse coalitions – and that means believe in Black people in the South,” said Lauren Groh-Wargo, who managed Abrams’ 2018 campaign for governor and now leads her Fair Fight Action political organization.

“For years, that just wasn’t a thing,” Groh-Wargo continued. “People told us year after year, no, Black people don’t vote in the South and white people are too hard.”

Essentially, Abrams was telling the mostly white, older power brokers in Georgia Democratic politics that they were on a fool’s errand trying to convince older white voters to return to the party after decades of a Southern shift toward Republicans. The path to closing the gap with Republicans, she insisted, was drawing new voters to the polls. In her vision, that would include everyone from transplants to metro Atlanta to older Black voters who just didn’t vote and younger white Georgia natives who simply aren’t as conservative as their parents and grandparents.

It almost worked in 2018.

Abrams won the Democratic nomination over a fellow state legislator recruited by the party’s white power brokers who weren’t convinced a Black woman could win in Georgia. In the general election, she finished less than 20,000 votes shy of forcing a runoff against Kemp, a small fraction of the usual Democratic shortfall of 200,000-plus votes. She turned her loss, and her insistence that Kemp had used his post as secretary of state to make it harder for Georgians to vote, to double down.

Transitioning her campaign into Fair Fight, the group continued registering tens of thousands of Georgians. The close loss drew in plenty of money, including a seven-figure investment from billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Other groups followed, seeing Georgia as fertile ground for Democratic organizing.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer more or less openly begged Abrams to run for the Senate in 2020 – at the same time some supporters urged her to run for the presidency. She demurred, continuing her work in Georgia and expanding Fair Fight into 19 other battleground states. According to Democrats with knowledge of their conversations, it was Abrams who helped persuade Warnock to run.

At the same time, Abrams never stopped pushing Democrats to support her Georgia efforts and copy them nationally.

“Any decision less than full investment in Georgia would amount to strategic malpractice,” Abrams and Groh-Wargo wrote in a 2019 memo sent to presidential candidates, Democratic National Committee leaders and top party strategists and pollsters. They wrote that Abrams’ 2018 coalition of nonwhites and whites from the cities and suburbs was a blueprint “to compete in the changing landscape of the Sun Belt.”

It was a national replay of the same tussle she’d had years before with Georgia power players, as she argued for an expanded electorate rather than chasing former Democrats and GOP-leaning independents.

Groh-Wargo emphasized this week that one difference between 2018 and 2020 was the success at turning out Black voters in rural areas. “This is the model for states like Mississippi and Alabama … even Ohio,” she said.

Abrams was among the 11 women whom Biden interviewed to be his running mate, a process that led to Kamala Harris becoming the first Black woman nominated and elected to that office. As Biden considered his options, Abrams again managed to rewrite some of the rules.

While some contenders, including Harris, sidestepped questions about being in the mix, Abrams was unapologetic about the possibility.

“The issue of being able to serve as lieutenant and possibly to step in is a question of competence, (and) I would put my resume against anyone else’s,” she told The Associated Press in May.

Days later, she explained her self-assurance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“As a young Black girl growing up in Mississippi,” Abrams said. “I learned that if I didn’t speak up for myself, no one else would.”

130,"Mar 11, 2020",Texarkana Gazette,"Come for the food, stay for the stories | Hot on the trail of tamales, on a road trip through the Mississippi Delta","Across the street from Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero Blues Club, the Delta Blues Alley Cafe hosts a lot of live performances during Clarksdale's many music festivals. (Alexandra Marvar/Chicago Tribune/TNS)

GREENVILLE, Miss. — Along the mighty Mississippi lies a 200-mile diamond-shaped swath of fertile farmland and floodplain known as the Mississippi Delta. It's a region rich with blues music, civil rights sites and agribusiness (especially cotton). It's also the spiritual home of a beloved snack called the hot tamale.

Similar to the Mexican version but pocket-sized, the Delta hot tamale is spiced cornmeal and meat, often pork, rolled up in cornhusk or parchment paper — portable, delicious and rich in history.

When Memphis, Tenn., native and Chicago restaurateur Eldridge Williams opened his Wicker Park bar and eatery, The Delta, in 2017, he wanted a theme evocative of his Southern roots, but something different and unexpected, too. Today, the menu is an homage to the Mississippi Delta hot tamales he grew up with.

""Who doesn't like tamales?"" Williams asked. ""But no one really knows the significance tamales have in African American history and Southern culture. What I love most about hot tamales is the history.""

There are several theories about how tamales came to the Delta. But the most accepted one goes back to the early 20th century, when plantation owners brought migrant workers from Latin America to work in the cotton fields, joining a largely African American workforce of laborers and share croppers.

""Mexican workers would travel with tamales in coffee cans,"" Williams said. ""Other families working in the same cotton fields were introduced to tamales and started to develop their own recipes, passing that tradition down generation to generation.""

Recipes are closely guarded, and good tamales are a point of family pride.

""Most of the people we met who are great at what they do in the tamale game, they're old and they've been doing this for decades after their parents and their grandparents,"" Williams said.

""Of course they're not going to tell us their recipes, so we just ate our way through the Delta until we figured out what we were going to do.

""The Mississippi Delta is a hidden gem,"" Williams added. ""You get more than just good eating. You get amazing stories to go along with it.""

Just down the street from the famed Crossroads, where bluesman Robert Johnson is said to have sold his soul to the devil (before penning his 1930s ode to the hot tamale), you can find Hicks' World Famous, 305 S. State St. Williams calls it ""arguably the best tamale joint in the Mississippi Delta.""

At the Crossroads proper, Abe's Bar-B-Q, 616 N. State St., no longer makes tamales in house. But it still serves the recipe the original Lebanese proprietor derived after falling in love with tamales from a local street cart in the '40s.

Round out the night with live blues at Red's, 395 Sunflower Ave., or at Delta native and actor Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero Blues Club, 387 Delta Ave., where the tamales are served fried instead of boiled. And then call it a night at the Shack Up Inn, 001 Commissary Circle Road, a good-vibes-only makeshift village of reclaimed cotton shacks decorated with thrift store finds.

Halfway between Clarksdale and Greenville is Cleveland, which debuted its $18 million Grammy Museum in 2016. Less polished sites such as Dockery Farms, 229 Highway 8, an old cotton plantation that claims to be the birthplace of the blues, are just as sacred, if not more so, to music pilgrims, history buffs and locals.

You'll find tamales at the rustic billiards-and-blues bar Airport Grocery, 3608 Highway 61. And if you swing by James Beard Award semifinalist Cole Ellis' Delta Meat Market for breakfast, lunch or bustling Friday happy hour, you can find them vacuum-packed to take home. The grocery store and restaurant are conveniently located in the Cotton House hotel, 215 Cotton Row.

Whether at Scott's Hot Tamales, 304 Highway 1, Hot Tamale Heaven, 1427 Highway 1, or a number of other spots around town, tamales are easy to find in this city of 30,000. In fact, it's the self-proclaimed Hot Tamale Capital of the World.

In an old, wooden house on the former blues thoroughfare of Nelson Street, seek out Doe's Eat Place, 502 Nelson St., winner of myriad culinary accolades and often called one of the country's best steakhouses. The James Beard Foundation named it one of America's Classics. Despite these titles, it's unassuming and unpretentious. The scent of grill smoke hangs in the air, and the odd retired steak knife might be found leveling uneven furniture. Tamales, steak and salad on the side make the quintessential Doe's meal. ""And let's just say it has tons of character,"" Williams said.

Plan ahead for the Delta Hot Tamale Festival the third weekend of October, when dozens of hot tamale makers come from hundreds of miles around to compete in a variety of categories. Other highlights include a hot tamale-eating contest.

On the town's main drag, the new Lofts at 517, at 517 Washington Ave., are a posh spot to spend the night.

In this town an hour southeast of Clarksdale, Giardina's, 314 Howard St., has been hosting Deltans for fine dining since the mid-1930s. In addition to the beloved steaks and fresh fish, try the baked oysters, homemade Italian sausage and, of course, hot tamales.

At The Crystal Grill, 423 Carrollton Ave., tamales are a great opener to fried quail, chicken livers and meringue pies. And Steven's Bar-B-Q, 208 Fulton St., is a classic meat-and-three (pick your meat and two traditional Southern sides) with hot tamales on the menu and, weekly, hot tamale pie.

Overnighters, check out the Delta's only upscale independent boutique hotel, The Alluvian, 318 Howard St.

If you head back north to Clarksdale from here, you'll pass through Money, Glendora, Sumner and Tutwiler, towns full of blues and civil rights sites. More tamale-tasting opportunities can be had by following the Southern Foodways Alliance's map to eateries in Rosedale, Yazoo City and Vicksburg.","— Along the mighty Mississippi lies a 200-mile diamond-shaped swath of fertile farmland and floodplain known as the Mississippi Delta.

131,"Apr 12, 2019",Oregon ArtsWatch,"Carola Penn, longtime Portland artist, dies","// // Oregon ArtsWatch

Carola Penn, a leading Pacific Northwest artist whose paintings were rooted in landscapes both political and personal, has died. She was 74.

Penn, who was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, spent most of her life in Portland, where she lived quietly, dedicating her days to her work. She was laconic by nature; prolific and disciplined.

Educated in the 1960s at the University of California at Berkeley, Penn studied under the leading midcentury California artist Elmer Bischoff. She was influenced by German Expressionism, Paul Klee and Van Gogh, but also absorbed much of the work happening around her at the time, most notably Bay Area artists David Park, Richard Diebenkorn and Joan Brown.

Penn’s activist bent took root during the Civil Rights Movement, when she was arrested for participating in a sit-in in Washington D.C. to unseat the Mississippi delegation during the 1964 Democratic National Convention. At the height of the Vietnam War, she and her husband, Dennis Anderson, decided to move to Canada. En route, they stopped in Portland, where they took up residence and never left.

Penn worked tirelessly, creating multiple series of paintings with subjects ranging from Lair Hill neighborhoods to inner-city Portland; from patches of grasses and weeds to Washington State’s Yale Valley forest; from politics to the inner landscapes of childhood. Painting on panels of wood, she experimented with cutting and rearranging the pieces. The resulting juxtapositions were occasionally jarring, often unexpected and always provocative.

Her last show, Disruptions, was curated by Dr. Sheldon Hurst and exhibited in 2018 at ArtReach Gallery in Portland. The exhibition, a culmination of her life’s work, would be her last. Soon after, she had to use a wheelchair and was unable to continue working in her studio.

Critic Carol Mazer wrote in 2018 of Disruptions: “Penn’s connection to place—Portland and its environs, where she has lived for some fifty years—is palpable. She is respectful, perhaps awed by the power of the forest and paints natural beauty lovingly. The brush strokes and colors she employs to paint its destruction evoke deep sadness … this show presents a very critical eye on what we have lost/gained in environmental terms, in human bonds, in the cohesion of communities. But, as Penn states in her brief notes, ‘I want to bring disparate elements together in order to stimulate thinking about mending problems and finding answers through on-going dialog.’ … Sheldon Hurst, curator of this show, chose a few quotes by writers whose concerns are germane to what you’ll see here, notably John Berger. ‘Hope,’ he wrote, ‘is not a form of guarantee; it’s a form of energy, and very frequently that energy is strongest in circumstances that are very dark.’ And in that sense these paintings most certainly are conceived and propelled by hope.”

Art Critic Randy Gragg wrote in 1994: Penn’s “thick, energetic brushwork builds to a climax of heavy grays and browns. She slices up her paintings, as she puts it, using the ‘jigsaw as a cubist weapon.’ The way she presents the finished pieces—spread across the wall and sometimes the floor—is a belligerent defiance of painting as ambient decoration . . . As so many other landscape painters keep the lawns orderly . . . [Penn] is digging at the uneasy beauty of the weeds.”

Art Critic Lois Allan wrote in 1995: “For Carola Penn, urban life yields images that are like mental snapshots . . . rundown storefronts, bridge girders, parking lots, even manholes in the pavement. All unremarkable fragments within the city’s kaleidoscopic movement, they form an ongoing, open-ended narrative . . . [Compartments] freezes these fragments in thickly layered, low-key colors and stark images—visceral responses to emotional as well as architectural divisions, and to the gritty streets and their inhabitants.”

On April 2, after a 3-year struggle with cancer, Penn died peacefully at home surrounded by her loving family. She was pre-deceased by her husband, Dennis Anderson, who died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Zoë Anderson; son, Lev Anderson; three grandchildren, Emma, Daniel and Dennis; three siblings, Roxie, Roy and Sue; and her 100-year-old mother, Miriam Silverman.

The family is hoping to have a memorial at Penn’s studio in the North Coast Seed Building this summer.

134,1 month ago,LSU Wire,Best LSU football recruit from every state since the year 2000,"LSU is fortunate to be in a hotbed of football recruiting in the state of Louisiana. LSU has traditionally been able to keep much of the state’s top talent close to home, but sometimes the Tigers have to go on the prowl beyond the state’s borders if they want to build the best recruiting class possible.

With another recruiting cycle in the books, now is a good time to take a look at the LSU recruiting efforts since the turn of the century and see who the best LSU recruit in each state has been.

To put together this list, the 247 Sports composite rankings are referenced. In all, 20 states are included in LSU’s recruiting efforts since 2000. The most fertile grounds for LSU recruiting are close to home in Louisiana and Texas. Those two states have produced players like Derek Stingley, Grant Delpit, Jarvis Landry, and Joseph Addai, just to name a few. LSU has also claimed some recruiting victories in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi and brought a recruit home from California, Michigan, and Ohio.

For the purposes of this list, JUCO players are included, and they are specifically noted. Keep in mind JUCO recruiting rankings are not necessarily the same as the traditional recruiting class rankings.

135,"Mar 25, 2018",TechCrunch,Here are the top Midwestern states and cities for startups – TechCrunch,"The American Midwest has a long history of making stuff. During the 20th century, it was the manufacturing center for the nation, and indeed much of the world. It’s still where a surpassing majority of agricultural commodities are grown and processed. But is it also a major producer of technology startups? Maybe not as much as the coasts, but the Midwest’s bustling metropoli and vast expanses of rural land prove to be fertile ground for quite a bit of startup activity.

And that’s what we’re going to take a look at here. In a similar vein to our recent analysis of startup fundraising in the South, we’ll break down the region into its constituent parts, assessing deal and dollar volume trends in the Midwest’s two primary sub-regions, some of its individual states and the most active metropolitan areas in the U.S.’s midsection.

And, to be clear, this is not Crunchbase News’s first foray into the region. We’ve covered the region’s seed-stage interest in AI and hard tech, a few notable rounds and have always included the Midwest in all manner of data-spelunking expeditions. And to this, we’ll add a deep dive into the numbers.

Defining the midwest

Borders and boundaries are a deep well of disputes. To preempt debate, we use the U.S. Census Bureau’s definition of the Midwest region which, unlike its definition of the South, shouldn’t be too controversial. If you have something against Kansas or Ohio being included in this group, take it up with the Feds.

The good folks at the Census Bureau split the Midwest into two distinct — and rather unimaginatively named — sub-regions: the West North Central and East North Central states, which are separated by the Mississippi River. We’ve included the map below.

By splitting the Midwest into two distinct parts, we’ll be able to see where most of the startup and funding activity is concentrated. Spoiler alert: The farther west you go, the startup population (and the population itself) grows more scattered.

Capital flows into Midwestern startups

Based only on reported data in Crunchbase, the Midwest appears to be affected by the same phenomenon as the rest of the country. Crunchbase News has previously found that the number of seed and early-stage deals has gone off a cliff in the U.S., resulting in a top-heavy market featuring many large, late-stage deals. And this wouldn’t be a problem if it weren’t for a shortfall in new startups to fill the next cycle of early-stage funding. The “hollowing out” of the Midwestern venture deal pipeline becomes readily apparent when you look at funding data for the past several years, which you can find in the chart below.

To wit, deal volume is down markedly since 2014, as Crunchbase News reported in its Q4 2017 report of startup funding activity in the U.S. and Canada. But somewhat counterintuitively, the amount of money being invested into startups is on the rise in the Midwest and throughout many other parts of the country, reaching fresh multi-year highs in 2017. Almost one full quarter into 2018, the trend appears to continue unabated.

But this chart abstracts away a lot of nuance, so let’s take a closer look at the region and its states.

Focusing in on Midwestern deal and dollar volume

We’ll start first with deal volume, because that’s a fairly decent indicator of a geographic region’s level of startup activity. Below, we’ve plotted venture deal volume, divided by sub-region.

Again, based on the reported data from Crunchbase, we found that deal counts have been on a downward trend for several years. And though some of this may be attributable to reporting delays, projected deal volume data for the whole of the U.S. and Canada (fourth chart down in the Q4 quarterly report) shows a years’-long downtrend. There’s no reason to believe that startup activity in the Midwest is materially different from the rest of the U.S. and Canada.

But what about the relative “balance of power” between the two sub-regions? At least when it comes to deal volume, has one sub-region waxed while the other waned? To a limited extent, the answer is yes. Between 2012 and 2017, the percentage share of all Midwestern dealflow going to West North Central states like the Dakotas, Minnesota and Missouri has grown from 25.4 percent to 31.2 percent, up by nearly one-fifth in relative terms.

Now let’s check out dollar volume. The chart below displays aggregate reported venture capital dollar volume raised by startups in the Midwest.

As far as the amount of money Midwestern startups have raised over time, the trendline is generally up and to the right. But that’s not the only way this differs from the deal volume data we looked at earlier. For dollar volume, there appears to be no appreciable change in the “balance of power” between the two sub-regions since 2012. Depending on the year, East North Central states like Illinois, Michigan and Ohio raked in between 70 and 78 percent of total dollar volume, but that variance doesn’t appear in an orderly trend.

Where are most Midwestern deals done?

We started first at the regional level, then compared smaller groupings of states. Now, let’s see how deal and dollar volume is distributed on a state-by-state level. Doing so will point to the states that lead the region in venture-backed startup activity. Below, you’ll find a chart of how deal volume is split between the top five Midwestern states.

And here is how dollar volume is distributed.

As we saw with our analysis of the South, the top five Midwestern states for deal volume are the same five top-ranked states for dollar volume. But there is some notable variation in how these states rank among each other and the amount of deal and dollar volume they account for.

Considering that Illinois is home to Chicago and a number of downstate universities with deep tech startup roots, the fact that it places first for both metrics shouldn’t come as much of a surprise.

What might be more of a head-scratcher is Minnesota, which ranks third in deal volume but second in dollar volume. Why does it switch places with Ohio? The answer could lie in the industrial mix which, in the case of Minnesota, includes a disproportionately high number of medical device and other life sciences companies, which typically take a lot of capital to get off the ground.

The top Midwestern startup cities

Longtime readers of Crunchbase News may remember a ranking of Midwestern startup cities we wrote back in August 2017. However, here we’re just focusing on deal and dollar volume over the past 15 months, since the start of 2017.

Let’s start first with the top 10 Midwestern cities as measured by number of startup funding rounds.

And in the chart below, you can see the top cities, as ranked by venture dollar volume, from the same period of time.

In both rankings, four of the top five cities are the same, but the odd one out appears to be Columbus, Ohio. Although there were a fairly large number of rounds raised by startups in that metro area, most of the rounds were fairly small by national standards. And one of the main reasons why Kansas City, Missouri jumped so much in the dollar volume rankings was a $100 million Series F round raised by C2FO.

But, again, as far as the Midwest goes, everything pales in comparison to Chicago alone.

For many, the Midwest is in a kind of Goldilocks zone. The East and West coasts seem to hold more or less equal sway over the culture and economy and most of its cities are neither too big nor too small. The only extreme it seems to occupy is its winter weather.","As far as the amount of money Midwestern startups have raised over time, the trendline is generally up and to the right.

136,"Apr 6, 2019",KING5.com,Puppy named Apple sets ASPCA relocation milestone,"With her move from Mississippi to New York, the floppy-eared puppy is the 100,000th homeless animal relocated by the ASPCA.

A floppy-eared puppy named Apple has a new home in New York, courtesy of an animal protection group and an overcrowded shelter in Mississippi.

Two weeks after being rescued from the streets of Starkville, Mississippi, Apple arrived in New York City on Thursday as the 100,000th homeless animal relocated by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

About 100 people cheered as a relocation van arrived in Manhattan. Apple rode north in a crate with Curry, a Chihuahua mix that was with her when she was found in Mississippi.

Apple is cute and workers doubt the brown, short-haired mutt with hints of a black mask will spend much time in her temporary home at an adoption center before finding a permanent home.

""Apple isn't going to be around very long,"" said Laura Nelson, director of relocation outreach for the nonprofit organization.

Similar to a program that rounded up and moved homeless animals after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, the relocation effort began in 2014. It sends animals from areas with lots of strays or unwanted animals to areas where there's a large demand for rescue animals but a small supply.

In the West, the organization said, animals are typically relocated from Southern California to the Northwest; animals from Texas are sent as far north as the Great Lakes. A large number of animals come from the South, a fertile breeding ground for strays because of the verdant landscape and warm temperatures.

Since many communities in places like Mississippi and Alabama lack funding for programs to spay or neuter lots of animals, the relocation program frequently moves animals from there to places including New York and New England, where stray populations aren't as large but demand for animals is huge.

Holding Apple in her lap, board member Michele Anderson of the Oktibbeha County Humane Society in Mississippi said the transportation program saves the lives of animals that otherwise could wind up being euthanized.

""Until aggressive spay and neuter programs actually make a dent in reducing the large number of unwanted and neglected animals in our community, animal relocation is the only life-saving option for many of our animals,"" Anderson said.

ASPCA said 2018 was the program's busiest year yet, moving 29,360 dogs, 10,610 cats and 344 other animals across the country to make them eligible for adoption.

Apple and about two dozen other dogs made the 1,100-mile (1,770-kilometer) trip from Mississippi to New York over two days with an overnight stop in Virginia. They rode in a truck with a cargo area that includes individual crates, a climate control system and video monitoring.

Trisha Deaton, who has been driving a relocation truck for about a year, said the trips seem like an endless cycle, with so many homeless animals in some places and so much demand for animals in others.

""I couldn't give you an exact number, but I normally do about two a week,"" she said.

After a health check in New York, Apple and the 16 other dogs in her shipment will be put up for adoption. Any of them could get new names as they move to homes with new families, and that's fine with the workers and volunteers at the Mississippi shelter.

""We hope they get adopted quickly,"" Anderson said.

Alex Coats

by Brinda Fuller Willis

As a box-office manager for Ardenland, Alex Coats likes the challenges of his job, such as helping bring a variety of acts to the Jackson area and aiding in the creation a vibrant music scene in the city.

""I love the fact that I get to be a part of bringing live music to Mississippi while challenging myself to put the spotlight on a place that is so culturally rich and important to the global stage,"" he says.

The 24-year-old grew up in College Station, Texas, and earned a bachelor's degree in communications with a concentration in public relations from Mississippi State University in 2017. While studying at MSU, he helped organized concerts and other events such as Bulldog Bash, so after graduation, Arden Barnett of Ardenland offered him the box-office manager position.

Through his work there, Coats has helped bring a number of performers to the Jackson metropolitan area. Most recently, he and Ardenland worked with Cathead Distillery to organize Cathead Jam, which included acts such as Jackson-based Young Valley, The Revivalists, Aaron Lee Tasjan and more.

Outside of work, Coats enjoys spending time with friends, getting to know people and spending time with his girlfriend, Katie Demetz. He's an avid Houston Rockets fan, but he says, ""I'm pulling for the Raptors, but the Warriors will probably win the NBA championship.""

Arthur 'Reggie' Dampier

by Dustin Cardon

Arthur ""Reggie"" Dampier had initially wanted to become an orthopedic surgeon because of his love of sports; however, his plans changed when he participated in a health-career opportunities program at Jackson State University while attending the former St. Joseph Catholic School in Jackson. There, Dampier met Dewey Handy, an optometrist who currently practices at Merit Health Central in west Jackson.

""I wanted to be able to get to know each patient on a one-on-one, direct basis. I saw optometry as a great way to accomplish my goals of being an entrepreneur with my own practice and giving back to my community. I also knew I wanted to (come back to) Mississippi to do it,"" Dampier says.

He received his bachelor's degree from Xavier University in New Orleans, and then his Doctor of Optometry degree from the Southern College of Optometry in Memphis in 1997. He opened Ridgeland Eye Care Center in 2000. The practice has been in its current location in 2008.

Dampier likes to give back to the community. One way is through Optometry Giving Sight, a global fundraising initiative that helps train eye-care professionals and open optometry schools in countries that lack them. Dampier's clinic also collects donated glasses to send overseas with missionary groups, and in the past, he has given free eye exams through the Madison Lions Club. He is the secretary and vice president for the state board of optometry.

""Taking care of eyes is something I think I could do for free,"" Dampier says. ""It's fulfilling to help people with the precious gift of sight.""

D'Artagnan Winford

by Mauricio J. Quijano

It was during D'Artagnan Winford's senior year at Leflore County High School in Greenwood, Miss., that an art teacher gave him a book about jobs in art.

""Before then, I didn't know what I would study,"" Winford says. ""My mom told me to go with my God-given talent so I went with art.""

After graduating from high school in 1996, Winford enrolled in Mississippi Valley State University in his hometown, Itta Bena. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in art in 2002. That year, he began working for MVSU as a graphic designer.

Winford went to work at Jackson State University as its art director in 2013, and then started as senior art director for Ramey Agency in 2016, where he works on projects for clients from around the world.

In his spare time, Winford, 41, likes to help artists and those who promote the arts gain recognition.

""If I'm browsing through social media, and I see someone trying to get off the ground, and I like what they are doing but see that they could use some creative help, I'll offer my services,"" he says.

Winford designed the logo for local nonprofit Feed Jackson, which organizes Dining with Dignity, an annual event that feeds the homeless.

Lately, Winford has been using his photography to help promote local artists, including painters, dancers and singers. He opened a studio for his art and photography in Jackson in 2018.

""I just want to shine a light on the creative community. Jackson is full of talented artists,"" he says.

Winford has been married to Cheryl Winford for 14 years and has four children. While he does not force his children to follow similar paths, they have chosen to be involved in the arts as well.

""I like helping them to explore their creativity,"" he says of his kids.

Derek Finley

by Dustin Cardon

Derek Finley, bureau manager of business development at Mississippi Development Authority, says that volunteering as a softball, basketball, and track and field coach for a Special Olympics team wasn't something he once saw himself doing. That changed in 2009 when he began working with Special Olympics Michigan.

Finley had connections to a nonprofit helping people with disabilities in finding jobs. In 2009, the group asked him to help them start a basketball program for Special Olympics.

""(Helping with) something like that was something I had never considered doing before,"" he says. ""But ... I decided to go along with it. Then, once I got involved and saw the wonderful experiences the athletes were having, I knew it was something I wanted to do.""

Finley, 45, was born in Michigan and attended Albion College in Albion, Mich., where he received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1995. He later received a master's degree in business administration from the University of Michigan in 2006. He worked as a supply executive for various automotive manufacturers after college, and then moved to Jackson in 2012.

In 2013, Finley helped Special Olympics Mississippi establish a track-and-field program, and a basketball program in 2014. He became an assistant coach in softball and flag football for the organization in 2015. He also serves on Special Olympics' statewide board of directors and as chairman of the board.

""It's great to see athletes, especially from low-income areas without a lot of experiences with structured sports, become more well-rounded, thrive and excel after being exposed to it,"" he says.

Wayne Ferrell once worked a case litigating a plane crash in Iceland. The plane was refurbished as a former vessel for drug runs in South America.

""The plane was involved in a crash before and should never have flown again,"" the attorney says.

Ferrell negotiated a sizeable settlement for the people killed in the crash.

""We got very close to the families,"" he says. ""We invited them over to the states, went to a baseball game.""

For the most part, Wayne Ferrell has remained in Mississippi all his life. He was born in Pascagoula in 1946 and, shortly afterward, he moved to Iowa when he was six months old.

""I was raised as a farm boy,"" he says. ""I knew I didn't want to stay there long because I didn't like the cold.""

Ferrell attended high school in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and then moved back to Pascagoula in 1962.

After earning a bachelor's degree in business and economics in 1969 from Millsaps College, he joined the U.S. Air Force.

He graduated from Jackson School of Law, now Mississippi College, with his law degree in 1975. He then received his Masters of Law degree in air and space law from McGill University in Canada in 1981.

""It seemed right to go into aviation law after the Air Force,"" he says.

Ferrell has owned his solo practice in downtown Jackson since 1995. His firm focuses on litigation, product liability law, commercial law, aviation law and environmental law.

He has also served with Team JXN since the beginning of the group.

""I've been working downtown since the '80s,"" he says. ""You go to Nashville, and it has a vibrant downtown, very clean. This area should be the center of activity.

""I have (acquaintances) who won't come down here. But I haven't had any problems. We're close to Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta, New Orleans. ... Jackson should be the crossroads of the South, there's no doubt in my mind,"" Ferrell adds.

Hugh Hollowell Jr.

by Mike McDonald

Hugh Hollowell Jr. had a job in Memphis, Tenn., earning a six-figure salary. He even dropped out of college because the employment opportunity was so lucrative. However, he began to wonder about his legacy.

""I had one of those quarter-life crises,"" Hollowell says.

The Byhalia, Miss., native had gone north to attend the University of Memphis from 1993 to 1996. He worked at New York Life and ING from 1996 to 2003, when he decided to quit, choosing instead to open used bookstore Midtown Books there. ""I went from earning $100,000 to about $18,000 so it was a big change,"" he says.

During his time in Memphis, Hollowell also got to know some of the homeless people in the city.

""That's one of the reasons I got interested (in that problem),"" he says. He wanted to help them.

Hollowell moved to North Carolina, where he had the opportunity to tackle homelessness. He lived there during his 30s and founded a nonprofit, Love Wins Ministries, dedicated to the intertwined struggle of hunger and homelessness.

He worked and lived in Raleigh for 12 years and then moved to Jackson in 2018 to be closer to his family. When he came here, he also wanted to use his background and knowledge to help solve a problem. Now, Hollowell continues his work to alleviate hunger and food insecurity within the capital city. He directs and operates Jackson City Farm, a collective of land plots in west and south Jackson. One is near the Metrocenter Mall, another near George Elementary and the third off Highway 18. The overarching goal of Jackson City Farm is to feed people in need.

""We're partnering with Stewpot to bring those served by the Stewpot organization healthy food which they use to serve meals,"" Hollowell says.

Jackson City Farm currently has two plots with fruits and vegetables, and the organization is working to clear a third one.

""I want people to know they have options when it comes to fresh food,"" Hollowell says.

Lance Wheeler

by Dustin Cardon

Lance Wheeler, curator of exhibits at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, credits his love of history to his late great uncle, Clarence Ball, who passed away at age 104 in 2016. Wheeler spoke with Ball, who was a World War II veteran, at length for a college senior thesis about the obstacles African Americans faced during the Jim Crow era.

""My uncle had to combat Jim Crow every step of the way, and having him share his experiences first-hand gave me a deep appreciation for our history,"" Wheeler says of the eye-opening experience.

""Sometimes stories can be lost if we wait too long to hear them, so I'm glad to have gotten that history, the oral history, of my family from him while I could.""

Wheeler has held his position since Oct. 1, 2017. He is primarily responsible for maintaining the museum's permanent galleries, as well as overseeing the creation and installation of temporary and traveling exhibitions.

He also organizes programs to accompany exhibits in the permanent galleries. In January 2019, he created MLK Poetry Night, which featured poetry performances honoring civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Wheeler also developed a program for young visitors titled ""Read,"" in which the museum brings in special guests such as Jackson first lady Ebony Lumumba to read books for children.

""Many think history is boring because they think it's about dates and dead people,"" Wheeler says. ""It becomes much more personal when you can find personal connections in it.""

Travis Crabtree

by Dustin Cardon

Travis Crabtree, who has served as a city planner for the City of Jackson since 2018, says he has been fascinated with the idea of public and outdoor spaces since he was a child.

""I've always been interested in the variety of different places and geographies in Mississippi's landscape and how they all differ, with everything from pine forests to wetlands,"" he says. ""Public spaces and urban design connect everything you see and how you interact with your environment.""

Crabtree was born in Dallas and moved to Jackson with his mother as a teenager in the early 2000s. He attended St. Joseph Catholic School and received his bachelor's degree in landscape architecture from Mississippi State University in 2014. He moved to Detroit after graduating and received a master's degree in urban design from the University of Michigan in 2016.

He fiancee Salam Rida, who is also a city planner, moved to Jackson in 2017.

Crabtree has dedicated his time in Jackson to developing public spaces such as parks and working to bring more public transportation into the city.

After he took office, Crabtree partnered with Rida and City Department of Planning and Development Director Mukesh Kumar to establish the city's long-range planning division.

Crabtree has overseen the transformation of a parking area on Congress Street into a small park called a parklet; a bike and foot traffic-friendly transportation corridor called ONELINE; and the Fertile Ground initiative, which created murals and art installations throughout the city to raise awareness about food access.

Crabtree, Rida and others are also developing the Ecoshed near Fondren.

""I want to help people be engaged with their city and create places that can be both be productive and serve as a place where people can gather and interact,"" Crabtree says of his passion.

Joshua Wright

by Donna Ladd

Joshua Wright was a Clinton High School sophomore when he showed up for the Mississippi Youth Media Project, which I founded, in 2016. Over two summers, I watched Wright grow into a leader. Then last summer, he was a paid video mentor for other YMP students, modeling more than technology.

""I'm learned how to not always push my ideas,"" Wright says. ""I learned to listen to other people's ideas, get constructive criticism. Let people get their ideas out. To step back."" He now confronts problems head-on, such as talking directly to students who don't act ethically or fairly.

Now 18, and headed to Rust College on a full scholarship, his mother Venetia Miller raised him alone, and well. ""I was trying to find who am I as a person—who do I want to be and what do I want to accomplish after high school?"" he says.

Wright will study broadcast communications, then work in radio or TV. He prepped by taping football games and practices, livestreaming events, and working on yearbook and newspaper staffs.

""I started growing as a person,"" he says. ""I started speaking in churches. I got the call. I also got the call that I wanted to do media work, camera work.""

Wright also had to find a way to pay for college. ""School is expensive,"" he says.

He landed at least six scholarship offers, four of them full rides. He plans to get involved in Rust student government and the local NAACP chapter, and is already selected to sing in the a capella choir.

""It's good to get away and branch out,"" Wright says. ""At the same time, I hate to leave my mom alone.""

Wyatt Waters

by Brinda Fuller Willis

Wyatt Waters's favorite way to paint is plein air, or on location.

""I like looking at life as it is,"" Waters says.

Jacksonians often see him in different locations in the city, painting different scenes, whether it be the Walker's Drive-In sign or even on location at events such as the annual WellsFest Art Night.

Eudora Welty's book ""One time, One Place,"" was an inspiration for Waters when he was studying art at Mississippi College.

""She took photographs of people and places just as they were, no frills, no added prompt and circumstance,"" he says.

The Brookhaven, Miss., native moved to Florence and then Clinton as a teenager. He received a bachelor's degree in art from Mississippi College in 1980. While at MC, Waters studied under Sam Gore, who inspired him to experiment with watercolor.

Waters' need to paint ""en plein air"" has led him to different places, including cities around Mississippi such as Oxford and other countries such as Italy. His work has been featured at locations such as the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art in Laurel, the Meridian Museum of Art and the Jackson Municipal Art Gallery.

Waters collaborated with chef and friend Robert St. John on four books: ""A Southern Palate,"" ""Southern Seasons,"" ""An Italian Palate"" and ""A Mississippi Palate."" His new book ""An Italian Travel Journal"" arrives in October 2020.

""I take pleasure in just looking at things as they are,"" Waters says. ""Things are never the way we think they are; there's always a story inside of what you are looking at.""","He graduated from Jackson School of Law, now Mississippi College, with his law degree in 1975.
His firm focuses on litigation, product liability law, commercial law, aviation law and environmental law.

138,"Feb 6, 2020",Key West Florida Weekly,Laissez Les Bons “Conchs” Rouler At SOUTHERNMOST MARDI GRAS,"On Monday, March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorers Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, and Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, landed on the west bank of the Mississippi River about 60 miles downriver from New Orleans. The following day was cause for double celebration — not only had the brothers discovered new(ish) territory, but it was also Mardi Gras, the Roman Catholic French tradition that encouraged the faithful to indulge in a bit of revelry prior to the 40-day ascetic fasting period of Lent. On the night before Ash Wednesday in the old country, the lack of refrigeration meant that all of the meat, cheese and milk had to be consumed, lest it go to waste while the household fasted. Hence, Mardi Gras, or, as we know it, Fat Tuesday.

Back in the New World, Bienville went on to found Mobile, Ala., the first capital of French Louisiana, where French settlers began to celebrate Mardi Gras in 1703. In 1723, the capital was moved to New Orleans and the growth of the city plus its Creole connections made fertile ground for Fat Tuesday to take root, grow and mutate like a debauched weed. Today, Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans draw hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city to attend parades and parties and pack the Big Easy from end to end.

Key West may not sit on a bayou or have deep French roots, but it’s been said on more than one occasion that New Orleans and Key West are kind of like sister cities. For starters, the oppressive humidity is overwhelming, whether you’re on Smathers Beach or strolling the Garden District. The Southernmost and Crescent cities are both known for their laid-back, live-and-let-live vibes. Our literary histories run deep, with Key West laying claim to Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway, both of whom were known to tipple in the Big Easy. And above all else, we both love a good time.

Now, Key West certainly isn’t looking to steal anyone’s Fat Tuesday thunder, but if you know anything about this fun-loving town, you know that we can’t resist a good party — especially if that party includes music, mirth and more than a little giggle juice. We don’t have 300-plus years of masquerading tradition to build upon, but Key West’s is finally ready to host is first Mardi Gras festival on Sunday, Feb. 9, at the Coffee Butler Key West Amphitheater — but we’re doing it our way.

To lend things that jubilant Mardi Gras air, Rams Head is bringing in New Orleans musician Troy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews, who will represent the Krewe of Freret as the Grand Marshall of their Mardi Gras parade next week in the Crescent City. Along with a performance by Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue, you can expect the likes of Big Sam’s Funky Nation and Grammy nominees Tank and The Bangas. Returning to Key West for the first time since 2018 will be Rebirth Brass Band, who are known for combining the traditional New Orleans brass band sound with hip hop, jazz, soul and funk.

According to Anthony VanDaley, director of operations and marketing for Rams Head and the acting manager of the Coffee Butler Amphitheater, the music was just the first building block in creating a Mardi Gras party that will cement our New Orleans connection. “We booked these four really great New Orleans bands and then realized that Key West doesn’t have any type of Mardi Gras celebration,” he says. “We have Fat Tuesday’s and that’s about it. People always compare Key West to New Orleans, so we thought it would be perfect to turn this concert into a festival, especially now that we have the space at the amphitheater. These musicians are really going to bring the feel of New Orleans right to Key West.”

Unlike some of the New Orleans Mardi Gras activities (Google Krewe du Vieux — we’ll wait), this family-friendly event will include fun for all ages. Children 10 and under are free and the whole family can enjoy face painting, a bounce house and a masquerade mask decorating station.

“We’re really committed to making this a family-friendly community event,” Van- Daley emphasizes. “Between the bounce house, the face painter and the Mardi Gras mask creation station, we’re really hoping to provide activities for kids of all ages in a safe and comfortable environment.”

No Mardi Gras festival worth its salt happens without beads (environmentally unfriendly though they usually are), so local organization MARC House will be selling and distributing beads at the amphitheater all day. In order to avoid waste and eco-destroying disposal so close to the Gulf of Mexico, MARC will also be collecting and recycling all bead necklaces in designated bins when the festival comes to an end.

For this midnight snacker, the best part of New Orleans is the food — crawfish, étouffée, beignets, bananas foster … sigh. The organizers of the Southernmost Mardi Gras Festival agree, so you can expect a great mix of NOLA-inspired fare from multiple food vendors. Chef Michael Torres from Tempt at The Saint Hotel restaurant will be on site cheffing up authentic Cajun bites like pulled pork in a Creole sauce, NOLA-style gumbo, king cake and more. Joey’s Bag o’ Donuts will be switching things up and serving beignets from their food truck while Endless Summer Grill is perfecting andouille sausage with all the fixings. Clemente’s will be rolling in its trolley with an across the board favorite: hand-tossed and wood-fired pizza.

For the drink connoisseur in your group, Fat Tuesday’s is donating frozen hurricanes and piña coladas, which will be served in a collectible and reusable cup, Multiple pop-up bars will be offering surprise craft beers (fingers crossed for Abita Purple Haze!), mixed drinks and domestic beer. The vendor marketplace will feature exclusively local vendors, including Lost Boy Creations, Concrete Ship Mercantile, An Elegant Touch Art & Engraving and Sandbar Clothing.

Though Key West’s one-day festival is a mere fraction of the weeklong celebration that consumes New Orleans, the goal is to grow the Southernmost Mardi Gras to be a complement to its Creole counterpart, if not in size, then at least in heart. “We’re really hoping to build and evolve year over year,” VanDaley says. “This year we have four bands, Cajun food, a partnership with The Saint Hotel (which has a sister property in New Orleans) and an after-party Fat Tuesday’s. Next year, we’d love to be able to plan a parade — even if it’s just down Duval Street to the amphitheater. Each year, we’ll change up the bands and get bigger and bigger, which will hopefully put us on the map of Mardi Gras celebration destinations. ¦","Hence, Mardi Gras, or, as we know it, Fat Tuesday.
