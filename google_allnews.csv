He’s one of the country’s best food and beverage law experts, and his firm McLaughlin PC is equally excellent. We should probably ask him for advice and insights more often. Now, this 16-year alcohol regulatory attorney vet and 2017 winner of the FX Matt Defense of the Industry Award by the Brewers Association is helping found a brewery in Mississippi.

Fertile Ground Beer Co. just announced plans for a craft brewery to be located in the historic Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Miss. Scheduled to open in 2021, Fertile Ground Beer will be housed in a former laundry building previously owned by Baptist Medical Center (kudos to reinventing old facilities). Descriptions of the locale so far include: large welcoming interior, spacious outdoor area and access to other attractions at Belhaven Town Center (a charming mixed-use development area in Jackson). As far as vision, let’s jump to the press release:

Fertile Ground Beer Co. is envisioned to be a third space. Third space is a sociocultural term to designate communal space, as distinct from the home (first space) or work (second space). The founders recognized a need for this, a place to gather, socialize and bring families, while incorporating their passion for craft beer. The transformative project will elevate craft beer in the capital city through an adaptive reuse development at Belhaven Town Center. Located in the commercial area of Belhaven, Belhaven Town Center opened with the first phase in early 2020 to include several new restaurants. The completed center will include dining, retail and small businesses. “Matthew and I were on the Belhaven Improvement Association board about a decade ago when I was just starting to think about Belhaven Town Center,” says David Turner, developer of Belhaven Town Center. “Matthew remembers me talking about this project and specifically that I wanted to get a brewery one day at this location. It’s cool how those early seeds were planted in both of our minds and we now see this coming to fruition. We are very excited about this group and their vast knowledge of the food and beverage industry and breweries in particular. We look forward to partnering with them on some cool events in the near future.” “It’s the perfect location,” says Matthew McLaughlin, co-founder of Fertile Ground Beer Co. and founder of McLaughlin, PC law firm. “We are so excited to open this brewery within the Belhaven Town Center development and know that it will be a destination that everyone can enjoy. The name Fertile Ground derives from the 2014 TEDxJackson event with the same name that focused on entrepreneurship, ideas worth spreading, creativity, and new urbanism in Jackson. Fertile Ground Beer Co. will carry these themes forward in the form of an inviting and open third space where people can enjoy locally and regionally made craft beer.” “We saw an opportunity and a need for a brewery in Jackson,” says Conner Reeves, co-founder of the brewery and attorney at McLaughlin, PC. “We aren’t quitting our day jobs, but wanted a place to drink locally-made beer. We put together a really talented team to create and operate the brewery and it’s backed by some great local investors who believe in the concept and location. The brewery will have craft beer options for everyone, from the enthusiast to the newcomer, so everyone can find their next ‘go-to’ beer.”

We’ll keep you updated on the progress.","Fertile Ground Beer Co. just announced plans for a craft brewery to be located in the historic Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Miss.

1,1,"Jun 10, 2020",Civil Eats,"‘Fertile Ground’ Explores How Jackson, Mississippi, Is Charting a Better Food Future","Obesity. Poverty. Food Insecurity.

Mississippi has the dubious distinction of ranking high nationally in each of these interlinked categories. With the exception of New Mexico, the Magnolia State is the most food insecure place in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents. The film, directed by Alex Warren, with executive producer Robby Piantanida, airs tonight at 7 p.m. Central Time on Mississippi PBS and is also available online at PBS.org.

“There is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement about the film. “In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people.”

Fertile Ground, which was funded in part by a grant from the Bloomberg Foundation, shows how historic redlining—a practice in which banks prevented people of color from buying mortgages in white neighborhoods—resulted in the mostly Black and impoverished neighborhood of South Jackson having few grocery stores but several convenience stores with low-quality food. The city’s car culture and lack of sidewalks and bicycle lanes add to the problem, making it a herculean task for residents without vehicles to obtain nutrient-rich food. And children in Jackson’s most economically disadvantaged areas rely on school cafeterias to get balanced meals. In Mississippi, 1 in 4 children experiences hunger, compared to 1 in 5 adults.

In the wake of these challenges, urban farms, city planning projects, farm-to-table restaurants, and efforts to provide residents with locally grown food offer hope that food equality in Jackson is possible. Fertile Ground isn’t just a film, but an initiative that aims to shape policy and public dialogue about food access and nutrition through art, workshops, panel discussions, and other events.

Civil Eats spoke with Jackson chef Enrika Williams, a Fertile Ground workshop facilitator, and Travis Crabtree, a Jackson-based urban designer and Fertile Ground project manager, about the new documentary, redlining, urban farming, and the food inequities their city faces.

How does the layout of Jackson contribute to food inequality?

Travis Crabtree. Travis Crabtree.

Travis Crabtree: Whenever you have a city that is extremely car oriented, obviously you have accessibility issues, especially when you have neighborhoods that don’t have good public transportation, low car ownership, and no sidewalks—which is the reality for a lot of Jackson. Jackson started being built from the core, which is downtown Jackson, and then over time, you had white flight and people started to leave the city. That’s when all the grocery stores left.

It’s a very typical pattern in American cities. It has happened all over the country, but Jackson is a place that’s already dealing with extreme poverty, racial tensions, and [less] access to resources. When it comes to food insecurity, it’s super exacerbated here.

The documentary discusses how poverty in some Jackson neighborhoods played a role in supermarkets leaving. Why do you think that is?

Enrika Williams. Enrika Williams.

Enrika Williams: You can find plenty of convenience stores that have decided to take EBT because people in the community who are using food assistance need a place to spend their money so they can eat. But the larger grocery store chains are in the business of making money, and capitalists are not empathetic to anything but . . . making money. So, if the majority of the people who come into your stores are on some sort of public assistance, you look at the bottom line and think, “I’m not making any money.”

I also think there’s a stigma attached to public assistance recipients. Stores don’t want to appear to be accommodating to a demographic of EBT recipients. There’s also an insurance standpoint: It costs more to put your grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. It’s like another form of redlining.

How does the history of redlining play a role in the city’s present-day food landscape?

Crabtree: It’s really clear what lines divide Jackson—the train yard, the interstate, and these other sorts of urban barriers, even institutions like colleges or hospitals. They act as really large barriers that are disconnecting the white neighborhoods from Black neighborhoods. And generally the white neighborhoods are the ones that have the grocery stores and are more affluent.

Redlining obviously exists in most American cities, but it’s so apparent here. One thing that we’ve done outside of the documentary is we have a major public art component. We’ve tried to position our public art installations at the intersections of the redlines to bring the two communities together. We’re putting them right up against the railroad tracks and the different sort of segregation points to try to have conversations about what an integrated Jackson would be like.","The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents.

2,2,"Jun 10, 2020",Northside Sun,“Fertile Ground” Documentary Airing on Mississippi Public Broadcasting and Public Broadcasting,"June 01, 2020 – The City of Jackson announced today that Fertile Ground , a documentary examining the extensive impact the industrial food system has on Jacksonians, will air on June 10th at 7pm CST on the Mississippi Public Broadcasting television station and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) will make the documentary available online here. On June 21st at 5pm CST Mississippi Public Broadcasting will re-air the documentary on their television station.

The Fertile Ground documentary follows the life of local residents experiencing challenges accessing healthy food options, while also detailing the systematic policy failures that have allowed “food swamps” to thrive. Featuring interviews with local farmers, food activists and city leaders, the documentary also spotlights the growing possibility to transform Jackson’s local food system. This documentary is part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Art Challenge. View the trailer here.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said, “This project is so important because we live in abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity and in our society there is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options. In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. And, in spaces where people have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. And so, as a city we should return the love and show our citizens that we want them to have an abundance of healthy food alternatives. The Fertile Ground documentary does an excellent job of portraying just how prevalent the problem of food access is here in our city and I am proud to have members of this administration actively working to remedy this issue for our citizens.”

The documentary team is comprised of homegrown, a host of Mississippi talent including, Executive Producer - Robby Piantanida, Director Alex Warren, Director of Photography, Aaron Phillips, Producer - Jocephus “Skipp” Martin, Sound Mixer, Taiwo Gaynor, Set Photographer - Drew Dempsey. Salam Rida, City of Jackson Urban Designer said, “The documentary is an art project that inspires a larger conversation about the issues with our global food system. The COVID-19 crisis has brought a newfound awareness to Jacksonians about where their food comes from and how global supply chain volatility can disrupt our everyday lives. At the City of Jackson we hope communities can use this moment to move forward on how we would like to address food access and decentralize some aspects of our food system.”

The documentary is part of a larger initiative called “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access”, which uses public art as a medium to inspire dialogue about food access in Jackson, Mississippi. The City of Jackson was awarded the grant from the Bloomberg

Philanthropies Public Art Challenge in November 2018. Mike Bloomberg said, “The Public Art Challenge is designed to strengthen communities like Jackson with moving works of art that highlight complex problems - and foster public discussion about solutions. Fertile Ground does just that, telling the story of a city that has too few healthy food options. It’s also the story of people – like Mayor Lumumba, artists, farmers, urban planners, and other local leaders – who are creating new opportunities to deliver better

options. As the Coronavirus proves especially dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, and as African-American communities suffer the highest death rates, Fertile Ground has taken on new power and urgency.”

In addition to this documentary, the project is made up of physical installations deployed within food deserts across the city, community engagement sessions, a podcast series, performance art, a food policy roadmap, and a project opening expo that has been postponed due to COVID-19. The project brings together an interdisciplinary network of artists, designers, architects, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, policymakers, and community members to discuss the complexities of the City’s food system.

4,4,"May 6, 2019",The Architect's Newspaper,"In Jackson, Mississippi, architects are taking on a citywide hunger problem","By more than one measure, Jackson, Mississippi, is one of the nation’s unhealthiest cities. In 2017, it was named the fattest city in America based on 17 indicators, including obesity rates, levels of physically active adults, and access to fresh produce. In fact, nearly one-fifth of city residents are considered food insecure. The state of Mississippi does not fare much better—for the last eight years, it was reported as the most food insecure state in the country, even though agriculture is the state’s top industry.

It’s not just that Jackson has only 17 grocery stores for a population of nearly 170,000—that’s one per nearly 10,000 people. But the food that is available is disproportionately tipped toward fast food and gas station items. As one scholar of Jackson’s food culture told the Clarion Ledger, “Hunger happens in between bags of chips.”

All of this is compounded by the city’s lack of viable public transit options. Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one. Even those with groceries or farmers’ markets in walking distance are discouraged by the lack of sidewalks or crosswalks. These conditions are undergirded by decades of generational poverty and disinvestment due to white flight, unfavorable tax policies, and the state’s aggressive efforts to cut resources for Medicaid and limit food stamps.

But Jackson also has a long history of civil rights activism, and its residents in 2013 and again in 2017 elected mayors who promised nothing less than wholesale social and economic transformation. For Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, addressing Jackson’s food access challenge is part of his promise to make it “the most radical city in the world.” But rather than enlisting conventional strategies, the city has mobilized its long-range planning division to lead a new design-based initiative. Bolstered by a $1 million public art grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access” brings together architects and artists alongside chefs, gardeners, food policy experts, and local institutions to facilitate a year of community-engaged interventions at three sites in the city. The project will culminate in a citywide exhibition in the spring of 2020, but ultimately it aims to establish a nonprofit research lab on food access that will operate on a permanent basis to sustain the momentum that is created.

The city invited an intriguing roster of architects and designers from around the country to participate in the multidisciplinary initiative: Kathy Velikov and Geoffrey Thün, directors of RVTR; Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Akoaki; Walter Hood of Hood Design Studio, and Jonathan Tate, who runs his namesake practice, Office of Jonathan Tate. Architects are central to the project, said Travis Crabtree, a senior urban planner with the city and one of the project’s coordinators. “When we first got the grant, people asked, Why are we spending $1 million dollars on an art project when we could feed people for a million?” he said.

Looking more closely at what these designers bring to the table may illustrate what can be gained from this approach. The question of access is at the heart of practices like the Toronto and Ann Arbor, Michigan–based RVTR, led by Velikov and Thün, who are both associate professors at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. In their ongoing project, Protean Prototypes, they conceive of public transit systems as platforms to address access to mobility, food, education, and health. They do this by mapping the social and spatial opportunities for access, connecting underserved areas with local actors who can bridge access gaps and by proposing lightweight spatial prototypes that overlay onto public transit infrastructure, such as bus stops and metro stations. The prototypes might include emerging tech like mobile produce vending systems and bike-cart shares alongside other programs with a small footprint like exercise equipment and book lending programs. Applying this method to Chicago, San Francisco, and Detroit, this complex systems approach brings together architectural and urban scale in new assemblages that amplify the resources already on the ground and take advantage of the larger urban context to channel them where they are needed most.

In Jackson, Velikov and Thün will focus their efforts at the Ecoshed, a 15,000-square-foot, open-air building on a 2-acre industrial site that borders two very different neighborhoods—the rapidly gentrifying Fondren and Virden Addition, one of the poorest in the city. For Fertile Ground, the Ecoshed will demonstrate a self-sustaining closed-loop food system and host the food lab, and eventually host the Fertile Ground nonprofit.

Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Detroit-based Akoaki will also focus their efforts at the Ecoshed. Their practice has engaged with the problem of food access through four years of work with an urban farm in Detroit, the Oakland Avenue Urban Farm. Sirota is also an associate professor of architecture at Taubman. Detroit provides a uniquely fertile landscape for thinking about urban food access. According to Sirota, Detroit has 1,300 urban farms, but none of them are sustainable. At the 6-acre Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, sustainability for Sirota and Farges has meant strategizing beyond economics alone. To them, urban farms are hubs for urban regeneration, and they realized that multiple layers of activity and programming were needed to realize that potential. Like Velikov and Thün, they see architecture as a way of “amplifying the activity that’s already happening on the ground, to stitch together new and productive alliances.”

Detroit may be 1,000 miles from Jackson, but the connection between the two cities runs deep. Like Jackson, Detroit is a majority African American city, with many residents who have ties to Mississippi and other southern states. Thus, the Oakland Avenue farm grows many heritage products from Mississippi. Likewise, the association to agriculture is similarly fraught in both cities; as Sirota noted, “We are highly attuned to the idea that going back to the land isn’t necessarily representationally positive to everyone.” Rather than framing urban farming as a return to an idyllic past (and glossing over the history of slavery and policies that led to the dispossession or denial of land to freed slaves), Akoaki’s urban farm work is firmly sited in the urban. “We’ve become astutely aware that the neo-rural is not rural; it’s something that deserves an aesthetic that hybridizes all the aspirations of the city and combines them with the necessity to produce picturesque landscape and food.” Thus the practice’s design of pop-up performance spaces next to the farm’s kale fields for the Detroit African Funkestra is based on the colors and shapes of shuttered music venues across Detroit.

Another participating architect, Oakland-based landscape architect Walter Hood, has extensive experience designing cultural and urban landscapes. Hood, who is also a professor at University of California, Berkeley’s will focus his efforts at Galloway Elementary in Jackson. The 4.3-acre, publicly owned lot is currently a playfield for a local elementary school. According to the city’s planning department, this site is located in a lower-income residential neighborhood with little public space and bordered by a major street dominated by fast food establishments. The theme here will be on food and community.

This is a good fit for Hood. His projects in Charleston, South Carolina; Macon, Georgia; Detroit, and Philadelphia, among other cities, demonstrate a steady thread of incorporating community feedback, local culture, and collective memory into landscape and urban design. In his Water Table installation at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, Hood tapped into the ecology and history of rice production by mounting thousands of Carolina Gold rice plants in circular planters on a platform in a school courtyard, essentially recreating a rice paddy in downtown Charleston. The project resurfaced the link between rice production and the history of the slave labor that made Carolina’s rice industry possible. Afterwards, the project was dissembled and distributed, planter by planter, across schools and institutions in the area, and lived on to continue the conversation. This archaeological approach also surfaces in many other projects by Hood Studio, including its master plan for Detroit’s Rosa Parks neighborhood. Hood’s work has long engaged with the idea of “being a protagonist in design,” and, in reflecting on the future work in Jackson, asked, “How do we make a landscape powerful, so that once you do it, it has a resonance?”

Finally, at Congress Street, the third Fertile Ground site, New Orleans–based architect Jonathan Tate will bring his experience with food culture and exhibition design to a downtown storefront space. The Congress Street site is close to the heart of government and is intended to amplify the project to public officials and policymakers who work nearby.

For Tate, who designed the Southern Food and Beverage Museum in New Orleans, the task includes not only the adaptive reuse of an existing building but also the design of an outdoor parklet that invites the public in through greenscape and seating. The challenge will be to bring it all together—the art, the history, the contributions of numerous partners, and of course, engage critical feedback, in a downtown that goes quiet at 5 p.m. on weekdays. “Instead of a veneer you’re walking through, it’s about bringing the space of the building out into the street,” he explained.

The architects, along with other Fertile Ground team members, began site visits in April, and will develop their proposals until the citywide expo in 2020.","Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one.

International Museum of Muslim Cultures Receives Kellogg Foundation Grant

The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently gave a three-year, $475,000 grant to the International Museum of Muslim Cultures in Jackson. IMMC has received grant awards totaling $1,140,000 from Kellogg Foundation since 2017, including $65,000 in June for COVID-19 relief.

IMMC is currently exhibiting “Muslims with Christians and Jews: An Exhibition of Covenants and Coexistence,” which opened in June 2020 at IMMC’s satellite location at 101 E. Capitol St. in downtown Jackson. The Exhibit introduces the “peace-building leadership of Muhammad, the Prophet and Head of State, who prepared the first Constitution in history for his multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious Commonwealth,” a release from IMMC says.

The museum is also displaying the “Legacy of Timbuktu: Wonders of the Written Word” exhibition at its 201 E. Pascagoula St. location, which emphasizes Islamic West Africa’s culture of literature, scholarship, wealth and empire-building, the release says.

IMMC has used earlier grants from the Kellogg Foundation as part of its efforts to educate communities nationwide in understanding that “human dignity is fundamental to combating injustice and achieving racial equity and healing.”

The Muslim Public Affairs Council will host IMMC in a virtual webinar on Thursday, Dec. 17, at 6 p.m. central time, which will feature “Exploring African Islamic Contributions to Civilization.""

8,8,"Feb 26, 2020",Jackson Free Press,Jackson's Food Insecurity Focus in April Expo,"In a state where one in four children go to bed hungry at night, solutions to the food insecurity that plagues Jackson and other southern cities are the goal of a series of public art installations and workshops. The Fertile Ground Expo, scheduled for April 9-11, aims to address the history and future of food access in Mississippi and beyond.

""We know when you are hungry, you can't perform at your best,"" Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at a press conference Tuesday in downtown Jackson. ""Hunger is a problem that reaches beyond one's belly but affects every aspect of a person's way of life, which ultimately impacts how we function as a society.""

Agriculture may be the state's leading industry, but Mississippi remains one of the hungriest in the country, Salam Rida pointed out at the presser. She is a program manager for the expo and an urban designer for the City of Jackson.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" In a recent report, the department revealed that more than 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2018.

Mississippi has consistently ranked as one of the most food-insecure states in the nation. Between 2010 and 2018, the state ranked No. 1 in food insecurity. It also has the highest poverty rate.

One in four Mississsippians—more than 600,000 people—experience food insecurity. The issue is especially profound for the state's elderly population and children. Half the state's senior population does not have enough to eat, and about 25% of Mississippi's children go to sleep hungry.

The Mississippi Food Network reports that in Hinds County alone, nearly 62,000 people have too little to eat—more than the entire food-insecure population of North Dakota.

Food insecurity has multiple adverse health impacts, ranging from developmental problems for young people to difficulties concentrating in school. Given that nutritious foods tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods, families struggling with food access are more likely to eat foods that are detrimental to their overall physical health. Experts also link food insecurity to additional problems such as housing access and inadequate access to medical care.

The USDA notes that a number of state-level factors affect the degree to which a state experiences food insecurity. These include wages, housing costs and unemployment as well as ""State-level policies that affect access to unemployment insurance, the State Earned Income Tax Credit, and nutrition assistance programs.""

""The goal of the expo weekend is not only to be critical of our existing food system, but to provide new ideas and solutions for developing a more food-secure environment for southern cities,"" Rida said.

Scheduled to take place in various Jackson neighborhoods experiencing food-access issues, the Fertile Ground Expo will bring together prominent area and national chefs, nutritionists, farmers, activists, artists, and policy makers for workshops, dialogues and exhibits related to food. More than 30 events will tackle topics including the history of food insecurity, how to ferment food, urban farming, food waste, the food traditions of Farish Street, the impact of food insecurity on families and more.

The event is free.

Participants include acclaimed artist Kara Walker, chef and food writer Mark Bittman, local chef Nick Wallace and interdisciplinary Mississippi artist Adrienne Domnick.

The mayor thanked Bloomberg Philanthropy for its $1-million gift to organize the expo. In 2018, Jackson became one of five cities that the philanthropic organization selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants as part of its Public Art Challenge competition. At the Feb. 25 press conference, Lumumba added that Bloomberg Philanthropy work was independent of Mike Bloomberg's campaign for the presidency, while emphasizing the need to focus on the problem of hunger.

""We live in a world of abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity. In our society, there is no room or justification for anyone to go hungry, for anyone not to have access to healthy food options,"" the mayor said at the press conference, adding that food is how Mississippians show love in their communities.

""Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. In spaces where people often have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you and provide you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. As a city, we should return the love,"" he said.

9,9,"Dec 6, 2020",Brewbound.com,Fertile Ground Beer Co. to Open Craft Brewery in Belhaven,"JACKSON, Miss. – Fertile Ground Beer Co. is pleased to announce plans for a craft brewery to be located in the historic Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Mississippi. Scheduled to open in 2021, Fertile Ground Beer Co. will be located in a former laundry building previously owned by Baptist Medical Center. The taproom-focused brewery will feature an inviting space where Jackson Metro residents as well as people passing through Jackson can enjoy locally-made beer. It will provide patrons with a large welcoming interior, spacious outdoor area, and access to other attractions at Belhaven Town Center.

Fertile Ground Beer Co. is envisioned to be a third space. Third space is a sociocultural term to designate communal space, as distinct from the home (first space) or work (second space). The founders recognized a need for this, a place to gather, socialize and bring families, while incorporating their passion for craft beer. The transformative project will elevate craft beer in the capital city through an adaptive reuse development at Belhaven Town Center. Located in the commercial area of Belhaven, Belhaven Town Center opened with the first phase in early 2020 to include several new restaurants. The completed center will include dining, retail and small businesses.

“Matthew and I were on the Belhaven Improvement Association board about a decade ago when I was just starting to think about Belhaven Town Center,” says David Turner, developer of Belhaven Town Center. “Matthew remembers me talking about this project and specifically that I wanted to get a brewery one day at this location. It’s cool how those early seeds were planted in both of our minds and we now see this coming to fruition. We are very excited about this group and their vast knowledge of the food and beverage industry and breweries in particular. We look forward to partnering with them on some cool events in the near future.”

The historic Belhaven neighborhood is home to numerous businesses, restaurants, artists, and one of the most popular August events in the Southeast. The Bright Lights Belhaven Nights annual music festival attracts several thousand people to the neighborhood. Attendees travel from neighboring states to enjoy three stages filled with live music, local artisans, and restaurants. In addition to the commercial and artistic attributes, Belhaven was designated as one of American Planning Association’s “Great Neighborhoods in America 2014.”

“It’s the perfect location,” says Matthew McLaughlin, co-founder of Fertile Ground Beer Co. and founder of McLaughlin, PC law firm. “We are so excited to open this brewery within the Belhaven Town Center development and know that it will be a destination that everyone can enjoy. The name Fertile Ground derives from the 2014 TEDxJackson event with the same name that focused on entrepreneurship, ideas worth spreading, creativity, and new urbanism in Jackson. Fertile Ground Beer Co. will carry these themes forward in the form of an inviting and open third space where people can enjoy locally and regionally made craft beer.”

“We saw an opportunity and a need for a brewery in Jackson,” says Conner Reeves, co-founder of the brewery and attorney at McLaughlin, PC. “We aren’t quitting our day jobs, but wanted a place to drink locally-made beer. We put together a really talented team to create and operate the brewery and it’s backed by some great local investors who believe in the concept and location. The brewery will have craft beer options for everyone, from the enthusiast to the newcomer, so everyone can find their next ‘go-to’ beer.”

Across the nation, craft breweries are having an immeasurable economic impact on their communities. Case studies have shown increases in residential and commercial property values located near craft breweries. Many craft breweries are opened in old or abandoned buildings breathing life back into the area and creating interest in the forgotten space. Craft breweries are also viewed as a quality of life amenity to many neighborhoods.

“I am thrilled that Greater Belhaven will be home to Fertile Ground Beer Co.,” said Casey Creasey, executive director of Greater Belhaven Foundation. “The brewery will not only create a community space for Belhaven residents, but will also attract our city neighbors while showcasing our historic neighborhood. Fertile Ground Beer Co. represents a national trend where breweries and brewpubs creatively repurpose existing commercial buildings and further transform neighborhoods. The brewery will be a welcomed addition to those restaurants and hospitality businesses that currently call Belhaven home.”

10,10,"Mar 23, 2020",Undark Magazine,"In the American South, Covid-19 Could Find Fertile Ground","In early 2018, Bill Crawford learned that Mississippi lawmakers intended to shrink Medicaid reimbursements by 5 percent. Crawford, a longtime community leader from Meridian, worried about the wisdom of cutting funds for medical care in the throes of an influenza epidemic.

He sat down and typed out a column for the Mississippi Business Journal, describing a situation across the state that looked grim. “Mothers with sick babies on Medicaid have trouble getting timely access to providers. Clinics are backed up, hospital emergency rooms are on patient diversion, and too many children are really sick,” wrote Crawford, a Republican who once represented the state’s 83rd district in the legislature. Given the burdens of the flu, he warned, further cuts to Medicaid could cripple small town hospitals, half of which are already reported to be at the brink of failure. Next door, in Alabama, 88 percent of rural hospitals operate in the red.

“Before any of this coronavirus came along, we were facing significant challenges in the health care area.”

“Before any of this coronavirus came along, we were facing significant challenges in the health care area,” said Crawford, who is 72 and now lives in Jackson. Today, with the relentless advance of the disease known as Covid-19, Crawford worries about his state’s vulnerability — especially given that the population is generally older, poorer, less insured, and stricken with higher rates of chronic disease than urban hubs. Mississippi, which has the lowest life expectancy in the country, is one of 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

“The attitude down here is that we don’t want government involvement in our lives,” Crawford said. “We wanted it when Katrina hit — when there’s a catastrophe. But otherwise in the general South right now, we don’t want it. We want to get rid of regulation. We don’t want to spend any money. We want to cut taxes. And that’s fine. But if you don’t tend to your essential infrastructure, you really put yourself at risk.”

While no corner of the country is likely to be untouched by Covid-19, some experts worry that the virus might leave a deadlier wake once it gathers strength in southern states. Early numbers are still low in the Deep South: Mississippi has about 250 cases and one death. Alabama has around 200 cases and no documented fatalities. Louisiana numbers are higher, at more than 1,000 infections and more than 30 deaths — though most so far are in and around New Orleans. But the mortality of coronavirus infection rises when patients have underlying health concerns.

One study in Wuhan, China, found that more than half the deaths occurred among those who had conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Another study in Italy reported that upwards of 99 percent of deaths were among people with prior medical conditions. In the U.S., data already suggest that rural counties, especially those in the South, bear the highest death rates from lower respiratory infections.

“The number of people who are going to be at risk is dramatically higher in the South,” said Jay Maddock, former dean of the School of Public Health at Texas A&M University who studies chronic disease patterns. Take high blood pressure. In Arkansas “41.9 percent of their adult population has hypertension, versus 24.5 percent in Utah. It’s almost double what some of the lowest states are,” he said. And while West Virginia has the country’s number one rate of diabetes, Maddock said, “Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana are two, three, four and five.”

In many ways, the United States was fortunate that Seattle was the beachhead for the epidemic, said Jeffrey Levi of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. “The Seattle-King County public health department and the Washington State public health department are two of the best in the country. And so as bad as it looks, it probably would have been much worse with a weaker health department that didn’t have a host of advantages, including a large cadre of very well-trained public health workers.” In comparison to many other cities, the Seattle area is also generally younger, healthier and well insured, Levi said.

More than 2,000 miles away, a far different health ecosystem awaits. In Mississippi, about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty — twice the rate of Washington state. In 2019, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama were ranked as the country’s least healthy states. “The less healthy the population, the more likely the epidemic is to have fatal consequences for individuals,” Levi said. “And the weaker the health system, the harder it will be to contain.”

Paul Erwin, dean the School of Public Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that the public health infrastructure in his state is solid, if underfunded, and small towns are generally coping with the same challenges as big cities. “Like all other health departments, they been severely hamstrung by the limited testing availability,” he said. For him, the bigger concern is the same thing that weighs on Bill Crawford — the physical capacity for care.

A wave of 120 hospital closures in rural America over the past decade has left many parts of the South with no nearby hospital, and many of those that remain have drastically offloaded services and staff to stay afloat. These rural hospitals have, on average, only about 50 beds, but in more isolated areas the number can be as small as 25 or fewer. And while beds devoted specifically to intensive-care — which many coronavirus patients will need — have been growing at large hospitals, they have been shrinking for small and medium facilities. More than 80 percent of the hospitals that have closed since 2014 were also located in states that did not expand Medicaid. “Not only are the rural hospitals closing,” Maddock said, “but the ones that we have are lucky if they have one ventilator. There’s a worldwide shortage of ventilators right now, but you’re not going to find them in the rural hospitals. And if you can get them, they’re very expensive.”

Many smaller hospitals cope with emergencies by stabilizing patients and sending them to larger cities with more specialized care — but once the virus reaches the countryside, urban centers are also likely to be full.

Levi, of George Washington University, also worries that many infected people in southern states may be gravely ill before they even seek care because more of the population lacks health insurance. Among the states that have not expanded Medicaid, more than half are southern. (In a line starting east of New Mexico, only Arkansas and Louisiana have taken the expansion.) After the testing shortage is overcome, people without health insurance are still likely to hesitate seeking timely care — even if they have the hallmark symptoms of infection — for fear of creating medical bills they can’t pay. So far, none of the emergency legislation addresses the cost of treatment for coronavirus; one Massachusetts woman’s bill came to $34,927.43.

“When it’s an infectious disease outbreak, you don’t want people to delay seeking a diagnosis and getting into treatment of some kind,” Levi said. But someone without health insurance may think, “Oh, if I go to the emergency room and I get a $2,000 bill, and what if I don’t even have it? I’m still going to get a bill,” he said. “That’s just going to make you hesitate until you are very sick.”

Paul Erwin agrees. “The lack of insurance plays a huge role in terms of access to care,” he said. “People who don’t have insurance are reluctant to seek care until things get to be dire for them. By that time, it can be difficult to provide them with treatment that will make a difference.”

In addition to lacking good health insurance, many people living in southern and rural states face a barrier of distance, said Catherine Flowers, a community health advocate who lives in Montgomery. (Flowers was the driving force behind a study that found a high prevalence of hookworm among rural communities Alabama.) “People in cities are having a hard time getting tested, but can you imagine if you have to drive 30, 40, 50 miles to get to the place — only to be told you can’t get a test? Then what’s going to happen?”

Finally, there’s the question of how the cultural and societal fabric might influence the pandemic. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram has reported that rural counties are generally more skeptical that the disease should concern them. “Other than city folk coming down trying to buy all our toilet paper, we haven’t been affected,” one volunteer fire chief told the newspaper. On his blog Trouble in God’s Country, Charlie Hayslett, a former newspaperman from Atlanta, wrote, “as I’ve documented before, rural Georgia is overwhelmingly Republican and pro-Trump, and there’s already national polling by Pew Research suggesting that Republicans are taking Covid-19 less seriously than Democrats.”

In a March 19 post, Hayslett lamented how people in the country seemed slower to restrict large gatherings, especially Sunday worship. “I started canvassing rural Georgia contacts earlier this week and one common theme in the feedback revolved around a reluctance to cancel church services; as things have worked out, it sounds like the cancellations are indeed taking place, maybe a week later than they might have,” he said. This is not simply a small town phenomenon. One Baton Rouge megachurch, in defiance of the Louisiana governor’s order to limit gatherings, held a Sunday service of more than 1,000 people on March 15, and another service two days later. So did First Baptist Church in Dallas, which has a flock of 14,000.

“Worship is essential,” pastor Robert Jeffress told a local television station.

That said, the response varied from city to city: Church of the Highlands, the largest congregation in Alabama with more than 50,000 members, announced on March 14 that all services in its 22 locations would be online. The church is also hosting a testing site, and partnering with food banks and schools support people in need. A message on the church web site reads, “Many of you have expressed a desire to help, reminding us yet again why we love being part of the local church with you.”

It is the social cohesiveness of Southerners — the gravitational pull to tradition and family — that stand to provide resilience in a time of overwhelming need. “Not to say we’re any different from anywhere else, but we do care about each other,” said Erwin, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “And I see that as something strong in our favor. There is this expression of concern for your neighbor and their wellbeing. And there’s the acknowledgement that your neighbor’s wellbeing impacts your wellbeing.”

Those same bonds also might deepen the psychological toll of an epidemic that could leave no town unspared. “I am someone that’s from a small community and I know that when you have one death in a small community, it’s devastating,” Flowers said. Several could be emotionally catastrophic.

For now, she’s actively pushing national leaders to consider reopening closed hospitals to care for patients, perhaps staffed by the military — a plan she said could help in areas that are already underserved. “Some of them are literally sitting empty, and some of them are barely open,” Flowers said. Communities elsewhere are also having similar discussions. The vacant buildings “can be repurposed, I think, pretty fast to be able to provide treatment for people that are living maybe in those regions.”

But that will require a rapid mobilization the coming weeks or months. “We are eking our way into the space, kind of like the nation, which means we missed an opportunity to slow this down in Mississippi,” Bill Crawford said. Still, he predicts that he and his neighbors will draw on one another, and their faith, to get them through.

“We’re a state in a Bible belt,” he said. “There’s a lot of prayer going on.”

15,15,"Mar 10, 2020",The Intercept,"Dispatch From Mississippi: Biden, Sanders, and the Battle to Win Black Voters in the South","On a bright and blustery Saturday afternoon, three days before the Mississippi primary, the 36-year-old mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, approached a group of men drinking beers around a pickup truck outside the Head Turners Barbershop. Bearing the seal of his office on a black windbreaker, Lumumba solemnly informed the men they were in violation of city ordinances, triggering peals of laughter all around. Then Lumumba got down to business. He was there to generate interest in Bernie Sanders, and skepticism about Joe Biden, the presumed favored candidate of Mississippi Democrats. Lumumba had arrived at the barbershop from a nearby Baptist Church, where he’d launched a Sanders volunteer canvass of the historic black community of Presidential Hill. While volunteers knocked on screen doors and left flyers on porches, he and another surrogate, the Miami-based organizer and educator Philip Agnew, hit the barbershops of north Jackson. Lumumba and Agnew tag-teamed what can be a heavy lift in Mississippi: introducing Sanders and his platform, defending his electability, and reducing his opponent Biden to a man, as Agnew likes to say, with black friends but no black policies. “Can you name one Biden policy?” Agnew asked Head Turners’ 60-something barber, Ron Davis. “Being Obama’s vice is not sufficient,” he continued. “He was chosen to balance the ticket.” Lumumba and Agnew together sketched Biden’s authorship of the 1994 crime bill and large back catalog of racist and borderline racist comments. One time, Lumumba recounted, Biden told him and other black mayors at a conference in Atlanta that black parents can’t help with homework because they “can’t read or write.” “I just want to make sure you know who we’re propping up,” Lumumba said as the meeting winds down. “We have a choice on Tuesday.” The taciturn barber didn’t need much convincing that Sanders’s moral economy sounded like a good thing. “The rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer,” he said. “People working all their lives, they should be retiring, but still have to work. That’s not right.” But his questions, and the questions from others in the shop, belied a wariness that can’t be overcome in 20 minutes a few days before an election: Why isn’t Sanders a Democrat? How can he offer free health care and tuition when the Republicans are cutting existing benefits? Isn’t this a capitalist country?

While the poorest, blackest, and most incarcerated states of the country would seem to be fertile ground for Sanders, at least in the primary, they’ve proven instead to be the most arid. The Alabama primary was a repeat of the South Carolina vote that refueled Biden’s campaign and sent Sanders’s into a cross-country skid, and Mississippi will likely continue the pattern. In 2016, there was no Mayor Lumumba in the barbershops arguing that Sanders deserves black votes and can beat the Republican, while the famous Democrat doesn’t and can’t. How that conversation develops will determine not just the viability of a Sanders nomination in 2020, but the long-term prospects of the multiracial, multigenerational social movement that was supposed to midwife it.

From the start, Bernie Sanders has said his candidacy can only succeed if powered by an unprecedented coalition of black, brown, and working-class voters — a magnetized juggernaut that could attract disaffected Americans in a virtuous cycle of self-perpetuating people power. While the campaign did bring in large numbers of Latinos, new Americans, and millennial black voters, South Carolina showed the limits of any coalition that is missing the older black voters who form a base constituency in much of the country. Biden sealed his victory there with 60 percent of the black vote, with no surge in new voters, a number that he increased to 75 percent a few days later in Alabama on Super Tuesday. Not much money is spent polling the Mississippi primary, but it’s possible that Biden will end up with 80-plus percent of the vote, with black voters making up 70 percent of the electorate. If so, it will be the second time in four years that Mississippi has handed Sanders his worst loss with a message taped inside of it. What does that message say? Biden’s resurgence produced a market for neat explanations of black political behavior. The narrative seems to have settled somewhere over the broad thesis that black voters, especially in the South, are generally risk averse and have good reason for being so. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn’s endorsement of Biden formalized the sense that, despite everything, Biden — with the familiar “D” next to his name — is the safest bet for a return to normalcy and a never-perfect status quo. Some white progressives find this rationale dismaying, given that Sanders performs well in head-to-head matchups against Donald Trump, and is running on a platform much more tailored to the needs of black communities across a range of issues, from health care to criminal justice reform. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio evinced this dismay when he suggested “the Clyburn effect” was a form of low-information false consciousness, echoing familiar Republican canards about black voters’ generational allegiance to the Democratic Party. Somewhere, right now, terms are probably being negotiated on a controversial future bestseller called, “What’s the Matter With South Carolina?”

The pushback was just as swift. Black voters, a chorus of voices proclaimed, have as fine an appreciation for the limits, dangers, tragedies, and ironies of U.S. politics as anyone can. The Nation’s Elie Mystal saw the South Carolina vote expressing the cynical judgment that Sanders was too good for us and that his presence in the general would hand Trump reelection — because “most white people are selfish and cannot be trusted to do the right thing.” In this view, the political risk antenna of older black voters is reliable and hard-earned. If it warns to take even money rather than bet everything on promises that won’t be fulfilled, maybe there’s a reason. But if the default conservatism of this position is understandable, it’s also dangerous and debatable, say Sanders supporters, not least for its failure to account for the urgency of the climate crisis. The Sanders campaign is based on a belief that a left supermajority can be formed, and that means finding ways to overcome resistance and win people over. “Our organizing has fallen short in some ways with black folks across the South,” Agnew said. “We’re purging the feeling that these people don’t know what’s real, because they do know what’s real. They live real lives. They’ve been told some lies, so we need to be able to engage with it, to speak to people’s anxieties and say, ‘We’re not the risky bet here.’ We have the people, the volunteers, the energy. The path is uncomfortable and new, but it doesn’t have to be scary. Our job is to engage with that on a real level, not talk down to them or call them low-information.” Organizers for Sanders say such engagement pays off in Mississippi the same as it would anywhere else, though the starting line may be a little farther back. The biggest obstacle to getting lifetime Democrats to question the party and imagine a new kind of politics is a lack of time and people, not just their “risk averse” natures. “Many people we talk to are hearing about Sanders for the first time from us, or the only thing they know is that someone told them he is a communist,” said James Hempill, a Sanders organizer and Jackson native. “It’s a question of having time to explain his program, address electability fears, and explain democratic socialism. But it’s doable. I just met an older black lady who was leaving her house to go cook for the homeless. She cares about people, votes in every election — the kind of person you’d expect to know about Sanders and the primary. But she didn’t. Not because she’s dumb; she just didn’t know.” Hempill racked up so many of these stories that when he started canvassing for six months ago, he decided, “if we had two years to raise awareness, knocking on doors and having conversations, Bernie wins Mississippi in a landslide.”

While the campaign did bring in large numbers of Latinos, new Americans, and millennial black voters, South Carolina showed the limits of any coalition that is missing the older black voters who form a base constituency in much of the country.

16,16,"Feb 25, 2019",GreenBiz,Soil becomes fertile ground for climate action,"Soil quality is a growing focus in the sustainability space, and for good reason: Fertile soil naturally stabilizes the climate and ensures resilient supply chains. But a third of the planet’s land is severely degraded, and fertile soil is being lost at the rate of 24 billion tons a year, according to a 2017 United Nations-backed study. So, a small but growing group of companies — some directly in agriculture or ranching, others indirectly via sourcing — are investing in healthy soil initiatives.

Soil, no matter how healthy, may not be the spiciest climate solution. It’s not a giant machine that can suck carbon directly from the air — or is it?

In fact, Earth’s soils contain more than three times more carbon than is stored in the atmosphere, and four times more than the amount in all living plants and animals. Biologically speaking, the microbes and minerals in soil systems serve critical, beneficial roles in land stewardship: They regulate water, cycle nutrients, filter pollutants, physically support plants and sequester greenhouse gases (GHGs).

Soil is, indeed, a buried treasure.

Essentially, what’s good for soil is good for the climate — and for business. Until recently, most of the action was cultivated by smaller, niche players in the organic and natural products space. Soapmaker Dr. Bronner’s special operations team, for instance, has long worked with suppliers and farmers to support soil fertility as part of its Fair Trade certification.

Soil isn't a giant machine that can suck carbon directly from the air — or is it? Bigger companies, too, must clean up their value chains, and one of the most effective ways is starting, literally, from the ground up — the origin of many soil-dependent commodities, from food to fiber to fuels.

That’s no easy task. Agricultural value chains are vast and complex, and some commodities’ supply chains can obfuscate the provenance of products. Combine that with a half-century of farming management strategies that prioritized higher yields of commodity crops, often with copious amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The result: depleted topsoil and decreased farm productivity, often leading to a continuous cycle of increased fertilizer inputs to supplement ever-degraded soil.

A number of soil-enhancing land-management strategies have been sprouting among food and ag companies, part of a larger movement of sustainable agriculture and its first cousin, regenerative agriculture.

Companies all along the food chain — from agricultural cooperative Land O’Lakes to retail behemoth Walmart to seed and ag chemical company Monsanto (acquired by German chemical giant Bayer in 2018) — have begun to embrace these strategies to meet sustainability goals, safeguard the resilience of supply chains, meet increasing demand for climate-friendly products and ensure prolonged profitability and reduced risk.

The toolkit of sustainable land-management strategies includes those rooted in pre-industrial era agricultural, forestry and ranching techniques, some employed by indigenous peoples. To name a few: cover cropping, crop rotation, no- or low-till farming, silvopasture, regenerative grazing management, applying compost as fertilizer, integrated pest management, planting perennials and carbon farming. The specific region, type of soil and crop variety are all key in deciding which strategies will provide optimal results.

Making the transition can be tricky. Long-term investments and increased labor costs are associated with some of these practices, which can have estimated annual returns of about $100 per acre. So, the most effective levers to influence sustainable soil health measures in supply chains involve offering economic incentives to producers, entering partnerships with other leaders and grounding these efforts in regional contexts.

For Kellogg’s, General Mills and Wrangler, incentives include providing measurement tools to agricultural suppliers to help them assess the current state of their land; paying for conservation consulting and workshops, such as regenerative agriculture expert Gabe Brown’s technical advice; and offering preferred access to specific crop markets for farmers that report sustainability progress. More needs to be done, of course, including directing private-capital flows looking to invest in nature-based climate solutions towards these soil initiatives.

More needs to be done, including directing private-capital flows looking to invest in nature-based climate solutions. There’s money to be made. Philanthropists, asset managers and impact investors are looking at an estimated $2.3 trillion opportunity. The Regenerative Agriculture Investor Network (RAIN) convenes these investors annually and develops reports about the state of private capital in regenerative agriculture. However, this space is notoriously underdeveloped: Less than 5 percent of philanthropic capital in the United States is invested in rural solutions. Microfinancing has been the traditional method of investing in rural areas of developing countries — but that has been focused primarily on conventional, not sustainable agriculture. Still, with socially and environmentally responsible investing on the rise, and with the expansion of voluntary carbon markets, such as blockchain-based platform Nori, the area is ripe for growth.

Partnerships are one preferred approach by companies, such as pursuing close supply-chain relationships, public-private-partnerships, landscape alliances and research institutions. Collaborations of this nature are key to implementing more sustainable land-management strategies: They can encourage farmers to use cover crops and other regenerative methods by ensuring that these things will be valued in the marketplace.

Soil-focused organizations such as the Soil Health Institute — which partners with The Nature Conservancy, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and Field to Market, along with General Mills and the Walton Family Foundation (the giving arm of Walmart’s founding family) — also offer numerous opportunities to support soil-healthy practices. These include a funding pool, information, research project assessments and collaborations and education.

One major move recently has involved establishing standards for measurements of soil health, so that scientists, farmers, managers and retailers can speak the same language. Another nonprofit, Carbon Underground, partners with companies such as Unilever’s subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s, General Mills’ subsidiary Annie’s Homegrown and Danone North America — specifically through its recently launched soil health research initiative — to conduct rigorous soil research for farmer participants, including sampling, analysis reports and training.

For many companies, such research leads to creating sample test bed sites. They allow growers to quantify test soil health measures in local contexts to find the most effective practices, as soil type varies by location. There are more upcoming opportunities for public-private partnering, especially with local governments, thanks to the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill by President Donald Trump. It extends the funding for programs that incentivize farmers to adopt environmentally beneficial soil health management, nutrient stewardship and carbon sequestering strategies. There’s even a pilot program to assess the economic opportunity of carbon sequestering land-management strategies.

It’s early days, but these are promising signs. With recent reports warning of the massive impacts of our current farming practices — up to 80 percent of the carbon in the world’s soil has been released already, with agriculture as a growing source of GHG emissions — it’s time to hit the ground running.

Key players to watch



General Mills — it hired a soil scientist to lead sustainability programs after realizing most of its emissions came from suppliers and farmers. It has invested millions in testing better land management strategies.

Land O’Lakes — the member-owned agricultural cooperative has a sustainability branch, SUSTAIN, that focuses on soil health. With its own technology platform, Truterra, farmers can synthesize soil, weather, economic and farm management data.

Midwest Row Crop Collaborative — this coalition of companies and conservation groups throughout the Upper Mississippi River Basin of the United States is working to ensure that farmers there are trained in conservation methods.

Patagonia — long a leader in regenerative agriculture, it is developing a stricter certification with ""regenerative organic"" practices. The clothing and gear company, which also has a food subsidiary, focuses on soil health in its agriculture and ranching practices.

Soil Health Institute — it partners with multinational corporations, universities, NGOs and government agencies to conduct and apply research, as well as to ensure the adoption of soil-focused land management practices and technologies.","Soil quality is a growing focus in the sustainability space, and for good reason: Fertile soil naturally stabilizes the climate and ensures resilient supply chains.

17,17,"Dec 3, 2020",WJTV,New craft brewery coming to Belhaven district in 2021,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – After a hometown Jackson brewery closed its doors a year ago, plans for a new craft brewery is the latest addition to the heart of Jackson’s historic Belhaven neighborhood.

”It’s something that Jackson hasn’t had,” said Jonathan Miles.

The brewery is part of a bigger project called the Laundry Market. Fertile Ground will be the lead tenant in the 19,000 square foot of the former Baptist Medical Center linen facility, as a part of an adaptive reuse development.

“You’ll see some retail in there, possibly another food, brewery— it’s a food a beverage,” said developer, David Turner.

Turner said this has been a plan in the works for at least eight years, and it finally took when he was approached by co-founder, Matthew McLaughlin, for a Jackson-focused brewery.

“I’m interested in a kind of a cool, outdoor lifestyle vibe down here. Breweries tend to promote that so thinking, running, biking, urban, so we’ll be tracking toward some retailer who will fill that space,” said Turner, “7,000 foot space inside the building behind us, and we’ve got about 7,000 feet of outdoor space as well which is important for the nature of a brewery.”

Neighbors are excited, too. Jonathan Miles works in the area and is looking forward to the addition.

“It’s good that somebody had the idea to get that in here and maybe inject that into the community. Maybe add some capital, revitalize some things in Belhaven neighborhood,” he stated.

Belhaven Town Center is said to be built upon old soul, but with a new heartbeat. The Town Center is currently home to Campbell’s craft donuts and tacos, Elvie’s All-Day Cafe and Spectrum Sip.

Construction is expected to begin Spring 2021 and open by Fall 2021. The brewery’s name will be Fertile Ground Beer.

19,19,"Oct 18, 2018",HubcitySPOKES.com,Mississippi does nothing to discourage predatory lending,"A state as poor and undereducated as Mississippi is fertile ground for those in the usury business.

People of modest means have few places they can go for a loan when they get into a financial bind.

If they have credit cards, odds are they’ve maxed out their limits. The banks don’t want to lend to them because of the high risk and low reward of doing so.

Their family members are just as broke and don’t have it to lend.

So, to get by, they resort to payday loans, title loans, check-into-cash loans and other ultra-high-interest financing.

This may get them past a current crisis, but it winds up putting them into even worse shape, causing them to go back again and again to the lenders, each time digging themselves deeper and deeper into debt.

The borrowers may never do the math to realize that the interest they are paying may be 10 times or more what even the most outrageous credit-card companies charge.

They need protection from themselves and from those who would take advantage of their economic troubles and educational deficits.

Yet, Mississippi has gone in the opposite direction, passing laws to make its most economically vulnerable even more so.

As Mississippi Today, the online news site, reported this week, when the administration of former President Barack Obama looked as if it was going to rein in the payday loan industry with tougher federal regulations, the Mississippi Legislature created an avenue to bypass them.

It authorized, with the urging of small-dollar lenders, a new product for making installment loans of up to $2,500 and charging interest at an annual percentage rate of almost 300 percent.

Over a year’s time, the amount of interest on these loan winds up being more than double the amount borrowed.

That’s sinful.

There should be a law against it, not a law for it.

Other states have enacted such prohibitions.

In fact, eighteen states, according to Mississippi Today, outlaw extremely high interest rates on small-dollar loans.

Others are in the process of trying to enact limits. Mississippi, meanwhile, hasn’t budged.

Admittedly, these small loans to people of modest means are risky.

To make up for the high percentage of loans the lenders will write off as uncollectable, they have to get a higher return from those who will pay.

Without it, this source of credit could completely dry up, leaving only knuckle-breaking loan sharks in their place.

How high is a fair return?

Many states are gravitating toward capping interest rates at 24 percent to 36 percent annually.

That range sounds reasonable both for lenders willing to assume the risk they won’t be repaid and for borrowers left with no other option.","A state as poor and undereducated as Mississippi is fertile ground for those in the usury business.

21,21,"Nov 2, 2019",Delta Business Journal,Dr. Tyrone Jackson – One of the Hardest Working Educators in the Mississippi Delta,"The Mississippi Delta has long been a fertile ground providing opportunity for those in and around it. The jobs provided can be an educational ladder to bigger and better opportunities for anyone willing to climb. For Rosedale native, Dr. Tyrone Jackson, his first job was that of a newspaper delivery boy. His latest job was announced last March (took office on July 1) is that of the ninth president and first African American President of Mississippi Delta Community College. The office of president at MDCC has been the culmination of dreams, inspiration and hard work. And a few extra paper routes along the way.

“I knew I wanted to be in education,” says Dr. Jackson. “Originally, I wanted to be a high school history teacher.”

After attending West Bolivar High School in Rosedale, Dr. Jackson travelled to Cleveland where he attained his Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology, a Master’s Degree and Doctorate in Education. But it was his part-time jobs that helped provide the opportunity to be a Statesmen.

“I financed my education through my paper route back in Rosedale,” he says. “A paper route definitely builds character – rain, sleet or snow, the newspaper has to go.”

Paper routes work on commission so Dr. Jackson had to collect from his subscribers in order to get paid. Not only did he collect but he doubled his route from 200 to 400 people in Rosedale. But when he came to Delta State, he learned more about the rich Delta soil and what it can provide non-farmers.

“I worked at the Delta State golf course. I ran the pro shop and sometimes in charge of watering the fairways and greens. And that’s how I financed my education initially, he says.

But using the same skills that he increased his newspaper subscriber base, Jackson came to know those who frequented the golf course and in providing them excellent customer service, they saw more opportunity for him.

“There was an opening in the Recruiting Office at Delta State and customers who came in knew about the opening and encouraged me to apply for it,” says Dr. Jackson. “Bessie Elliot,

Director of Recruiting at the time and Dr. Wayne Blansett, Vice President for Student Affairs at the time, hired me.”

Much like doubling his paper route, Dr. Jackson’s work ethic and demeanor helped DSU experience significant growth in enrollment, particularly minority enrollment.

That four-year job was part of his 14-years on campus as a student and employee. He moved in the Housing Office as associate director of housing working for Elsie Lynn Ervin where he managed residence halls and two apartment complexes. He coupled that with advising campus Greek organizations. He drew upon his time as a member of the oldest historically African American fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha.

“Basically, I was the advisor for historically black Greek organizations at Delta State,” says Dr. Jackson.

After five years behind that desk of sorts, Dr. Jackson transitioned to the academic side of his career at Delta State. He was tasked with reuniting the graduate studies division from several educational schools to one.

“The graduate school was decentralized. I was charged with centralizing admissions processes and other graduate-related functions under the auspices of a single department.”

Working with Dr. Paul Starkey, Dean of the Graduate School, Dr. Jackson served as the Director of Graduate Studies before moving up to the position of Assistant Dean of Graduate and Continued Studies and his last position at DSU was interim Dean of the Graduate School and Continuing Education for the next five years. He even found his way onto other

Delta area college campuses as an adjunct professor at DSU, MVSU, MDCC and Coahoma CC.

“I taught everything from dual enrollment courses all the way up to doctorate level courses,” he says.

The Delta native then found his way into the community college system with on campus permanent jobs where he flourished while improving the schools he became associated with. First at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community, as Associate Vice President for Student Services for the District and also at the Jefferson Davis Campus as Dean of Student Services. His “job hat collection” accumulated as helped with leading the Student Services Departments of Admissions and Records, Financial Aid, Counseling, Student Activities, Fitness Center, Testing and Police Operations.

That career success brought him to Hinds Community College, the state’s largest community college, as Associate

Vice President for Student Services/Dean of Students, and as Vice President for the Utica Campus and District Dean of Students. While there he heard about the opening in Moorhead and was soon on his way “home” to the Delta to apply all of his skills and knowledge to the MDCC campus from behind the college’s President’s desk. But he owes it all to a former teacher who put him on the path to becoming a teacher. A tough one who lived to teach and not just have students memorize facts.

“I’ve had a solid foundation to prepare me for this position,” says Dr. Jackson. “I had strong teachers in high school but it was, Carrie Ann Bell (now deceased) my biology teacher who also taught me chemistry – she inspired me to be a teacher. She was such a brilliant person and was all about academic excellence. She didn’t use any notes and she wrote on the chalkboard from the time class started until the bell rang. She basically challenged us up one

side and down the other.”

The new president rates her as the toughest teacher he’s had including all of his college level classes. Her teaching gave him an appreciation and understanding what a real educator is even though his own grades didn’t show it all the time in her class.

“You would take a test from her and think you may have an ‘A’ on it and when you get it back you may have a 75 or 80 or failed it. Basically, in high school you regurgitate things back on a test. But in her classroom, it was totally different. You had to know the material and be able to apply the material in a real-life scenario. I can remember vividly my first test in her classroom and I got it back and there were red marks from beginning to end and I made an ‘F’ on it. You needed to study, know the material and be able to apply it.”

Dr. Jackson admits he didn’t like it as a student but now from behind his president’s desk, he is grateful for her

teaching style and demeanor.

“While she was living, I conveyed my appreciation and I even spoke at her funeral,” he says.

And all that he learned outside the classroom about the Delta area he grew up in has helped Dr. Jackson as he takes on the challenges at MDCC. He’s been traveling the seven-county area that MDCC primarily serves promoting and getting the positive messages out about what a Trojan education can do for students.

“I’m out and about in high schools, meeting with the board of supervisors, talking to the communities to find out what the needs are,” says Dr. Jackson. “I’m speaking at Rotary and Lions Clubs in all of these counties every week. And I converse with the audience to find out what the needs are because I want Mississippi Delta Community College to be the college of choice in the Mississippi Delta region. I want to meet these needs and basically be a catalyst to address those needs in the area.”

In his first few months, Dr. Jackson is “doing a lot of listening now” but notes the college had a 5.1 percent increase in enrollment this year and he wants to “put a lot of effort into enrollment management efforts. Not only do we need to get them here but retain them. I’m big on campus image. The actual third reason people choose a college is simply campus appearance. I’m big on grass being cut low, weeding and edging. Those are my pet peeves. I tell my maintenance crew all the time, a coat of paint makes a world of difference.”

In addition, Dr. Jackson has a facilities list of needs that include a new men’s residence hall, the new administration building, a new law enforcement training academy building and the arts.

“I’d like to see us have a new band hall,” he says. “We hired a new band director in late summer and we’ve given him the charge to re-institute the band.”

With thoughts of his former teachers who shaped him, Dr. Jackson is looking to keep and hire the best faculty members he can find.

“I want to continue our efforts to attract the best faculty and staff here at MDCC” he says.

Vocational and workforce training is high on his list of priorities as well.

“We’re going to continue to access what the needs are in our area and we’ll provide those training opportunities to address them,” he says. “We want to be the

educational provider for vocational and workforce.”

And as funds from the state have been limited for community colleges, Dr. Jackson will be looking to raise money to help meet the college’s needs both inside

and out of the classroom.

“I want to lead the efforts and assist students and staff in maximizing our assets,” he says. “I want to make sure we’re hitting on all eight cylinders.

While his day job doesn’t leave a lot of time for hobbies, Dr. Jackson has found time to serve on numerous boards. He has served as a board member for Habitat for Humanity, United Way, United Village and graduated from Delta Emerging Leaders and Leadership Mississippi. While on the Coast, he served on the Harrison County Youth Leadership and Gulfport Chamber of Commerce Boards and he is a graduate of Mississippi Community College Leadership Academy and a graduate of Leadership Gulf Coast. But of

all the honors and accolades surrounding his name, he is proudest to be married to Kashanta and is father of two children, Tyler (12) and Kennedi (8).

“Watching my children. He plays baseball and she’s in drama club, a cheerleader and takes dance lessons. Spending quality time with them is of upmost importance to me. I like travelling and seeing new places, particularly exposing my kids to places I only dreamed of as a child.”","“I knew I wanted to be in education,” says Dr. Jackson.

22,22,"Nov 30, 2018",Jackson Free Press,"Bloomberg Gives $1 Million for Jackson Art; Talks 2020 Plans, Stop-and-Frisk"," The small-statured, thick-accented former billionaire mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, descended upon Jackson on Nov. 29 to announce a $1-million public-art grant, while perhaps putting out feelers for a 2020 presidential bid.

At a small downtown parklet in the shadow of the Governor's Mansion and in eyeshot of the Mississippi Capitol, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba joined Bloomberg and other city and state leaders to celebrate funding for ""Fertile Ground,"" a public-art project designed to inspire dialogue about food access.

""We welcome you to the deep-fried South,"" Lumumba said in his introductory remarks. ""We take often a lot of cultural pride in our food and our history here. ... Many of the things that we cook and take pride in today are because our forefathers and foremothers had limited access to fresh fruit and fresh opportunities. When you go all the way back to the plantation, people cooked things that they had available to them.""

After some pleasantries about the beautiful fall day, Bloomberg talked about the role of public art in cities. He said the Statue of Liberty is probably one of the best examples of public art reaching people and delivering a powerful message.

""I've always believed that arts are a smart investment for cities,"" Bloomberg said. ""Art makes cities more beautiful and enjoyable places to live, and I've always thought that culture attracts capital a lot more than capital attracts culture.""

He said this tends to set off a cycle of artists being driven out as droves of people flock to the city everyone wants to live in, and artists move on to do the same thing in the next city. Although Jackson's planning department is working hard to ensure no one gets priced out of Jackson as it undergoes development, the art community will get a boost from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

""Our judges—I was not one of them—were impressed with your project called 'Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access.' Food access, as we all know, is an important topic both here and around the country,"" Bloomberg said. ""This will be a community-wide effort I hope that not only leads to greater access to healthy food here in Jackson, but that it also inspires a conversation that spreads out across our country.""

More than 200 cities with populations of 30,000 or more submitted proposals for temporary art projects around civic issues. Fertile Ground will bring together artists, architects, filmmakers, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, and community members to create a city-wide exhibition to address the vast number of fast-food restaurants in the area and the lack of access to healthier options.

In 2017, Physician's Weekly labeled Jackson as the fattest city in America.

""In spite of all these problems, we can almost never have a comfortable conversation about food,"" Mukesh Kumar, director of the City's planning department, said. ""Most of the time it goes into judgmental points, and we typically just gloss over the entire thing. So we figured the best way to handle it is actually through public art.""

Kumar said this project is rooted in the mayor's commitment to food justice, healthy citizens and affordable quality of life for every citizens, but it is also a testament to the tenacity and hard work of the City's Department of Planning and Development.

This project will take place across three sites.

The Ecoshed is situated between Fondren and the Virden Addition on the other side of the tracks, one of the blackest and poorest areas of the city. Fondren, originally a suburb of Jackson, has been split in recent decades between mostly white residents on the east side of North Street with more African Americans on the west side, but has become more mixed as whites and some businesses have moved in over the last decade. The installation here will make use of the open-roof, courtyard-style building to develop a floating installation about food sovereignty and the food system.

The Galloway Elementary playfield sits behind a thoroughfare of fast-food eateries on Woodrow Wilson Drive. The installation would be a large land bank, or ""berm,"" to block the school's view of the ""food swamp.""

Cindy Ayers, who operates Footprint Farms in Jackson will help with this initiative.

""We've always taken a stand about having access,"" Ayers told the Jackson Free Press. ""For me, it's all about making a difference holistically. I think our City is truly moving, and our mayor understands the importance of what it takes to be a healthy city. To have Mayor Bloomberg say this is a place to do some things, I'm sure it's going to cause more pleasant activities, more investors coming in.... I'm so proud to be a farmer, I'm so proud to be a citizen of Jackson.""

The third installation will be downtown on Congress Street near the Governor's mansion. It will expand upon the parklet where Bloomberg made his announcement with more lighting and furniture with the help of an AARP grant. A mural from Adrienne Dominick and Scott Allen will go in the alley on Congress Street, and an experimental food lab will go into the 426 Capitol Street building, one of developer Kip Gilbert's recent purchases. Chef Nick Wallace will help with the food aspect.

Salam Rida, urban designer with the planning department, who also co-designed the parklet with fellow designer Travis Crabtree, hopes the project will help with long-term planning in Jackson.

""I'm very excited to be part of the public-art challenge. I think it's great not only for Jackson but for the whole State of Mississippi,"" she said. ""I think it's really invigorating to have someone on a national presence being here in Jackson. I think it really shows not only the City's commitment but a national commitment, which I think is hopefully going to encourage other people who could potentially invest in the City.""

Bloomberg for President?

The interaction between the two mayors was jovial, but this was not their first time meeting. This summer, Mayor Lumumba was part of the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative, a three-day, immersive classroom experience for 40 mayors across the world. Through a partnership with the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School, the training gives mayors who may not have a lot of management experience the skills they need to be effective, Bloomberg said.

""We got to know each other in New York, and you're very lucky to have this guy,"" Bloomberg said of Lumumba.

In response to a TV reporter's question about a potential 2020 bid, Bloomberg said he will give more thought to it in the beginning of 2019.

""If I had an opportunity to do something in Washington, I would certainly think long and hard about it,"" he said. ""But what I'm trying to do now is to go around the country and talk to people and listen and see what's on their minds and how receptive they would be, and there are plenty of other people who will probably run, and we'll see what happens.""

Bloomberg on 'Stop and Frisk' in New York

During a question-and-answer session immediately following the announcement, this reporter asked about Bloomberg's controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" policing program from the early 2000s, and whether or not he had suggestions for Jackson, a city in the thick of police reform.

Mayor Lumumba quickly interjected to clear Jackson's association with the controversial strategy, which was greatly reduced in New York City after a federal judge found that it targeted mostly black and Hispanic people and was, thus, racial profiling.

""I do want to emphasize this point, the City of Jackson does not have stop-and-frisk; we do have food insecurities,"" Lumumba said. ""I think that as we look at the best outcomes and the best ways to protect our cities, we need to be able to have fruitful dialogue in how we accomplish that. We can't take reductive measures when there are so many things our communities are faced with, and right now we're talking about the food insecurities that our food insecurities are dealing with.""

Like someone preparing to re-enter the public eye, Bloomberg did not shy away from any line of questioning about the controversial stop-and-frisk strategy that began under previous Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, but exploded when he was mayor from 2001 until 2013 with Raymond Kelly as police commissioner.

""I'm not familiar with the crime here in Jackson, everybody's got some crime, and some places it's terrible, and some places it seems to be at low-level, although any crime is more than you want,"" Bloomberg said.

""When I got into office back in 2002, we had 650 people getting killed every year, when I left, it was down to about 300 people.... Crime is a problem, and crime unfortunately generally is something that hurts young people. Certainly the violence in the streets is a young person's problem, and so we've just got to do something about it.""

Young black men in Jackson's Washington Addition have told the Jackson Free Press they have been stopped and frisked by Jackson police officers for no reason.

A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the stop-and-frisk practice was unconstitutional and the New York chapter of the ACLU found that since 2002 when Bloomberg trumped up stop-and-frisk as his signature public-safety program, New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since. Fifty percent of those stops every year since then have targeted African Americans, with Latinos as a close second. The NYCLU says nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent.

Crime did fall in New York City under Bloomberg, but crime nationwide has been on a downward trajectory since the 1990s. Crime rates remained low after the judge ordered a rollback of the discriminatory practice.

Bloomberg, a former Republican who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, also managed to touch upon climate change, the NRA and his legacy as a three-term mayor in New York City—clear national talking points. New York City has strong gun-control laws; stop-and-frisk practices were designed to take weapons from New Yorkers, as well as find people with outstanding warrants.

""I focused very hard then and now as a private citizen on fighting the NRA,"" Bloomberg said in Jackson. ""We need background checks on people who have criminal records, or psychiatric problems, or minors shouldn't be able to buy guns. That's what we worked on, and we were very successful in bringing down crime. I'm happy to say that my successor has kept crime down; In fact, it's a touch lower since he came into office than it was when we left.""

Email city reporter Ko Bragg at [email protected].","""Our judges—I was not one of them—were impressed with your project called 'Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access.'
Food access, as we all know, is an important topic both here and around the country,"" Bloomberg said.
To have Mayor Bloomberg say this is a place to do some things, I'm sure it's going to cause more pleasant activities, more investors coming in....

24,24,"Sep 8, 2020",The Architect's Newspaper,"The New Orleans–based Jonathan Tate talks hurricanes, homes, and hotels","Architect Jonathan Tate was living and working in Memphis when Hurricane Katrina ensnared New Orleans. Instinctively drawn to the Big Easy, he later moved there for the opportunity to observe the reconstruction effort and investigate architecture’s role in it.

“Embedded in the practice from the beginning was a desire to look around and postulate,” said Tate, referring to the namesake office he founded in the Lower Garden District in 2011.

Indeed, Office of Jonathan Tate (OJT) brings a probing, “investigative” (the word and its cognates have a special resonance for the small firm) spirit to wide-ranging issues relevant to New Orleans. Its projects, which span everything from low-rise housing to planning initiatives, often combine research with philanthropic funding and aspects of community building.

But however diverse its portfolio, OJT has become virtually synonymous with the Starter Home* series it has developed over the better part of the past decade. These contemporary takes on speculative urban infill were awarded the 2018 AIA National Housing Award and the 2019 AIA National Honor Award (for 3016 St. Thomas and No. 4-15, Saint Thomas/Ninth, respectively), and cemented the firm’s selection for the 2020 American Academy of Arts and Letters Architecture Prize back in April.

“Our investigations started off with a very purposeful [question], ‘How can we knock down barriers?’” said designer Maggie Lloyd, alluding to OJT’s first foray into the Starter Home* series six years ago. In turn, the office gained insights—about market dynamics, say, and architecture’s complicity in pernicious socioeconomic narratives—that “have permeated everything else that we do,” Lloyd added.

Recently, OJT has been expanding the scope of its practice to the surrounding region and designing spaces for experimental nonprofit development models. Seeing New Orleans redefine itself after Katrina helped Tate and his team (which currently numbers nine) understand that every city is always going to be rebuilding in some way. “It allowed us to be more adaptable to malleable urban situations,” Lloyd said.

3609-13 S. Saratoga Starter Home* (2019)

Like the two previous “generations” in OJT’s Starter Home* project, the S. Saratoga Street homes are a contemporary twist on affordable speculative housing aimed at first-time homeowners. The new infill units re-subdivide irregular New Orleans lots and incorporate contextual cues into their architecture for added depth. Developed in partnership with the real estate investing platform Small Change, the nation’s first equity crowdfunded single-family units work to address housing inequalities, Tate said. The projects, he added, examine “the economics around housing” and consider “why thoughtful design wasn’t available in a speculative market.”

Ground Notations (2020)

Created as a part of the public art installation Fertile Ground in Jackson, Mississippi, Ground Notations works to reconceptualize land use and educate residents about food insecurity. The site-specific installation inscribes industrial farming patterns across the historic Smith Park in the heart of the city. The geometrically ordered row crops, long bench seating, and ground mural were completed in April, but the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the official opening of the project and the corresponding Fertile Ground Expo to 2021.

Magazine Street and Travelers Hotels (2020–)

In addition to affordable housing and public art, OJT has been developing a new operational model for boutique urban hotels that leverages local artist communities toward boosting small-town tourism. “It’s a play on an affordable housing model wrapped around a business model,” Tate said. Travelers Hotel in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and the soon-to-be-completed Magazine Street hotel in New Orleans are managed by artist co-ops, whose members are afforded apartments and studio spaces above the guest rooms.","Architect Jonathan Tate was living and working in Memphis when Hurricane Katrina ensnared New Orleans.

Albert Sykes

Community Organizer

Albert Sykes grew up in Jackson's Shady Oaks neighborhood. His first view of something other than the blighted neighborhood came in the form of Bob Moses' Algebra Project in sixth grade. Moses' influence and Sykes' realization that he was in a state that refuses to fully fund education but still holds schools accountable for the types of students they produce defined his purpose in life.

""That was the first time that I discovered that in this country you don't have a constitutional right to education,"" Sykes says. ""I knew coming out of high school that I wasn't doing anything else but community-organizing and community-organizing around education.""

He helped found Young People's Project, an out-birth of Bob Moses' Algebra Project that trains young people to teach their peers mathematics, in 1997.

The 36-year-old father of four is active in the Our JPS Coalition, made up of people and community organizations who oppose the state takeover of Jackson Public Schools, and is a member of the NAACP State Education Committee. He currently serves as executive director of the Institute of Democratic Education in American, or IDEA, whose work centers around protecting public education. He hopes that IDEA can change the negative image of public education, especially in Mississippi.

""We try to show people that wherever you can point and see a bad school, we can show you some great students and some great educators that are doing the best that they can with the little that they have been given,"" he says.

Sykes hopes that his work will create a legacy in Mississippi that he can proudly leave to his sons.—Torsheta Jackson

Chrissy Cheshire

Rescuer

Chrissy Cheshire, 32, knew she needed to make a difference when she saw the amount of dogs in a local animal shelter who needed homes. In 2011, she began her small nonprofit charity Cheshire Abbey after serving on the board of Community Animal Rescue & Adoptions, or CARA, in Jackson.

Cheshire was born in Louisiana. Her family moved to Jackson when she was in seventh grade She graduated from Jackson Academy in 1998 and then graduated from Mississippi College in 2002 with a bachelor's degree in communications.

She describes Cheshire Abbey as ""a nonprofit ministry that helps animals anyway we can in our community and out of our community as well.

""We just do whatever we can whenever we can with the funds that we have,"" Cheshire says.

As a nonprofit business, Cheshire Abbey functions solely off the work of Cheshire herself and many volunteers. Her normal day of work can be filled with any surprises that may be expected when running a business, she says. ""Every day is a new adventure,"" she says.

When she and others rescue the dogs, foster homes throughout the community take them in, but Cheshire herself will also take the animals in if they are in need of more hands-on attention or medical assistance. In some cases, these foster homes eventually become permanent homes through the process of adoption.

""Although we lose a foster home, it is a gratifying feeling to see these dogs finally find a nurturing home,"" she says.

Cheshire hopes that her actions provoke a change to the laws toward animals in Mississippi. For more information, visit cheshireabbey.com.—Taylor Williams

Damarco Gibbs

Entrepreneur

Damarco Gibbs, owner of It'z a Wrap MS, was 19 when he started working for his brother Oscar in Madison, Miss. That job introduced him to the business of tinting car windows. Then, after watching ""Taxi,"" Gibbs had the idea to sell ""color-changing car vinyl wraps.

""There's a scene in the movie during their attempt to escape where they pull the film off the car, and it's an entirely different color underneath,"" he says.

Gibbs was working for Oscar at PWT Customz Building, but he always had the desire to follow his own path. He also wanted to do something that would inspire the young people around him.

When he was 23, he used $200 to buy some self-adhesive film, and by following instructional videos on YouTube, he completed his first job: wrapping his own Dodge Charger in a powder blue color.

In 2013, he noticed interest for this product, so he went to Jacksonville, Fla., to get a car-wrapping certification at Hexis, a manufacturer of self-adhesive films for marketing. Same year, Gibbs returned to Mississippi and started his business.

""My first customers were relatives, but I started using social media to advertise,"" Gibbs says. ""Fellow car enthusiasts were enthralled with the idea that they could change the color of their vehicle without damaging the paint underneath.""

Gibbs notes that even with the growing popularity of color-changing wraps, he felt like something was missing from his business, so he began researching film types for commercial wraps.

""I ordered the machine to print commercial graphics, taught myself Photoshop and started printing my first commercial projects,"" he says.

Inspiration for the idea came when he began to receive calls from commercial clients such as dealerships looking for ways to spruce up their vehicles and attract buyers, he says.

Now, Gibbs, 29, has wrapped vehicles for companies from a number of states from Louisiana to New York, and some nonprofits. He has also opened a new location in Pearl, Miss.—Mauricio J. Quijano

Elizabeth Henry

Empowerer

Elizabeth Henry's passion is working to reduce the disparities that under-represented populations face. The 30-year-old Jackson native is the program director for Thriving in Ministry, an initiative at Millsaps College that provides women in ministry a network of support.

In its inaugural year, the program will support a cohort of 22 senior, solo or associate female pastors.""I'm really excited about this because it is a way to empower people who are truly called, but are often under-resourced,"" Henry says.

Empowerment is central to her calling. As a campus minister for the Wesley Connexion, she seeks to connect students through faith-based programs on campus. Henry says the organization is an opportunity to unite the student population by hearing and addressing their concerns.

""We realize that Millsaps is a very diverse campus, so we want everyone to have a space where they feel safe, respected and able to connect with God however that makes sense for them,"" she says.

Her work is deeply rooted in the belief that all people should experience love and safety. ""For people who that has not been true physically, I want them to feel safe and loved by God and among God's people,"" she says, ""whether that's (LGBT) persons, persons of color or people from different nations ... whatever systems we need to put in place to ensure that is the case or whatever relationships we need to build, I want to empower people to be most able to use the gifts that God has given (them).""—Torsheta Jackson

Jauan Knight

Influencer

Jauan Knight has a heart for helping young people. ""It's always been my passion to help young people and especially those who look like me and who grew up in communities like me, who don't have (a lot),"" he says.

As an undergraduate student at JSU, it became important to Knight to be active in the community. He volunteered with Planned Parenthood Generation Action and Organizers for Action Mississippi, interned with the American Civil Liberties Union and was active in the Student Government Association. Seeing a need for political activism by young people, Knight joined Hinds County Young Democrats and helped organize the JSU Young Democrats. He is also the founder of the JSU Mass Choir.

This summer, he served as a camp counselor for Camp 360, a week-long residential camp that Jackson Revival Center, or JRC, sponsors. He also works with the JRC Millennials, the church's young adult ministry.

Now an undergraduate recruiter for JSU, Knight, 23, remains a member of the Hinds Young Democrats with plans to volunteer for several campaigns this fall. He also remains active with the choir he f ounded, acting as its staff adviser. For him, it is all part of being a model youth can follow.

""I feel like that is an area I've been called to while I still have influence because I'm still young,"" he says. ""I want to take full advantage of my influence.""—Torsheta Jackson

Linda Sermons

Hopegiver

Hope Lodge Head Manager Linda Sermons describes her main job as ""making sure the building doesn't fall down,"" she says. She also places importance on making sure her guests are comfortable, giving them what they need and someone to talk to.

""Just seeing a smile as they walk through the door can make their day,"" Sermons says.

Hope Lodge gives a home away from home to cancer patients who are receiving treatments from hospitals around the area. Each patient gets a private room and caregiver; space to socialize with each other, workers, volunteers, family members and friends; access to a washer and dryer; and more benefits.

Sermon's parents, Mississippi natives Jessie and Bettye Bracey, raised her in Worchester, N.Y. As a junior in high school, her family moved back to Mississippi, and she graduated from Murrah High School in 2006. Her bond with her northern home then drew her to New York for two years.

While working at a call center, her urge to give back to her community grew stronger. In August 2017, Sermons decided to apply with the American Cancer Society in Jackson and became the coordinator at the corporate office here.

""I was looking for something where it did matter when I went to work; it made a difference,"" she says. ""I knew I had a bigger purpose. (I) didn't realize it was going to be this, but I knew I had a bigger purpose.""

She was involved in the preparing of the groundbreaking plans for Hope Lodge in Jackson.

Under her management, Sermons, 31, plans to not only improve the Hope Lodge experience for those involved, but to also strengthen the bond that has blossomed between the community of Jackson and the Hope Lodge, she says.—Taylor Williams

Sam Humphrey

Ecofarmer

After hearing that Boulder, Colo., was one of the fittest cities in the 2016 Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index, Jackson native Sam Humphrey wondered how that healthy population could serve as a model for his hometown to combat the various health challenges that Jacksonians face.

""How could I connect those two populations of people?"" he mused.

The 27-year-old Jackson native graduated from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, N.C., in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in environmental science, concentrating on sustainable agriculture. Prior to his tenure at Warren Wilson, he attended the University of Colorado in Boulder.

In answer to his question about how a fit city like Boulder could serve as a model for Jackson, he started Fertile Ground Farms in January 2019. The business, which currently operates out of the Ecoshed west of Fondren, is a regenerative urban farm that uses no chemicals on its plants.

Currently, Humphrey grows vegetables such as sweet peppers, cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes. He sells to locations like Urban Foxes, Green Ghost Tacos, Walker's Drive-In and the Farmer's Table at the Mississippi Farmers Market. ""I want to stay within the city limits,"" he says. ""There's no reason for this food to travel.""

He is also managing farming sites for the Fertile Ground Project, which seeks to improve the city's access to healthy food.

The nonprofit organization has also contracted Humphrey to plan an educational garden at Galloway Elementary School and planting an edible garden at Smith Park in a future redesign. The Ecoshed will also have a grocery store in 2020, he says.—Mike McDonald","He helped found Young People's Project, an out-birth of Bob Moses' Algebra Project that trains young people to teach their peers mathematics, in 1997.

The soil was largely infertile.

Support Local Journalism Your membership makes our reporting possible. {{featured_button_text}}

“Back in the 1960s the attitude was, we’ll put down some cover soil and it will be good,” he said.

The park had been built over a former industrial area, and Hartsig found demolition debris — bricks and wood and bottles — just a foot below the surface. The cover soil had been trucked over from Lambert International Airport, which was under construction at the time.

Hartsig described it as a very silty loam — sloppy when wet, like concrete when dry.

“But they wanted to keep as many trees as we could, and that meant we had to work with existing soils that were there, as well as bring in good soil,” he said.

Note: This is a Ted Stillwell column from several years ago.

My Indian spirit guide, Chickasaw Indian Princess Linda Hawkins, related to me an old legend about her people that went something like this:

In the days of old, the Chickasaw lived in what is now Oklahoma. Then, a great strong tribe on the warpath came down from the north, driving them from their homelands toward the east. In the daytime they were guided through the wilderness by a dog. They also had a magic pole, and at night they planted this in the ground. In the morning it leaned the way they were supposed to go.

When they crossed the great river (the Mississippi River) the poor dog drowned. So, they were stuck with only the pole, and it refused to lean anymore, so the Mississippi became their new home. Then, as many generations passed, the white man came along and drove them back to Oklahoma. That could be how they got their tribal name because Chickasaw means “to leave.”

The Chickasaw people are closely related in language and culture to the Choctaw, and both tribes have cultural ties to the Creek.

The rich, fertile soil of the Mississippi floodplain was alive with vegetation and abundant wildlife such as white-tailed deer and black bear. The Mississippi and its tributaries also offered up many kinds of fish, such as the giant catfish, sometimes weighing as much as 200 pounds. So the men went fishing and hunting and the women tilled the soil, planting corn, beans, squash, sunflowers and melons. Over time they spread out along the river in what are today Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. They built their villages on higher ground among the trees and away from flood waters. The Chickasaw houses had the pole frame construction found throughout much of the Southeast, with a variety of materials used as coverings – grass thatch, bark or hides.

Living along the Mississippi it didn’t take them long to encounter the Europeans as they came along. The Chickasaw, for the most part, had a good reputation. They practiced what some scholars called the “law of hospitality,” sharing their meager rations with anyone who came along. Their first European contact was in 1540, when Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto encountered them and even stayed in one of their towns for a while. After various disagreements between these two totally different peoples, the Chickasaw attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying them.

De Soto quickly moved along. They didn’t care much for the French either when they came calling. They had to whip a few of them just for the sport of it. In fact, no one messed much with the Chickasaw, not even their nearest neighbors, the Choctaw. It seems as though the British were the only ones the Chickasaw really took a liking to. They traded furs and pelts with them for English guns and rifles

Allied with the British, the Chickasaw were often at war with the French and those skirmishes continued until France ceded its claims to the region east of the Mississippi after being defeated in the French and Indian War.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the Chickasaw fought as allies of the new United States under General Anthony Wayne against other Indians. Following the American Civil War, the United States did give the Chickasaw problems for a few years afterward because the Chickasaw sided with the South.

Today, the Chickasaw Nation is about an hour's drive southeast of Oklahoma City, with headquarters in Ada, Oklahoma, and is one of the Five Civilized Tribes.

29,29,"May 21, 2020",WholeHogSports,SEC fertile ground for football's best coaches,"The best 25 college football coaches list compiled by CBSsports.com was an interesting read.

Let it be said, the website admitted it’s a subjective list made up of the opinions of its staff writers.

It also said the retirements of Urban Meyer (Ohio State) after 2018, and Chris Petersen (Washington) and Mark Dantonio (Michigan State) after last season offered some wiggle room for new coaches.

To save you the disappointment, no Arkansas Razorbacks coach made the list, although one Arkansan did.

Mark Stoops of Kentucky was the first SEC coach to show up, ranking No. 22. He has turned the Wildcats from pretenders into almost contenders in the SEC East. One remark is that if he continues his current wins-per-season pace, he will pass Bear Bryant’s 60 wins to become the Wildcats’ winningest coach at the end of next season.

Coming in at No. 18 was Fort Smith native Gus Malzahn. His agent, Jimmy Sexton, pretended Malzahn was interested in taking the Razorbacks job, and that persuaded Auburn to sign him to a $7 million a year contract. If he gets fired after this season, Auburn will owe him around $25 million.

There wasn’t another SEC coach until we got inside the top 10, which turned out to be SEC territory.

Dan Mullen at Florida was No. 8. He first made Mississippi State a winner before taking on a rebuilding job with the Gators. He is the only coach in the top 10 who hasn’t won a conference championship, but he does appear to be on his way to one. There’s a good chance he will become Razorback Nation’s favorite coach not at Arkansas, depending on how Gators transfer Feleipe Franks plays at quarterback for the Hogs.

Jimbo Fisher, Texas A&M, was No. 7. Fisher won a national championship at Florida State in 2013, which had to be why he was voted this high. In two seasons at A&M, he’s 17-9 overall and 9-7 in SEC play. He’s landed some good recruiting classes, but that’s the norm in Texas.

Kirby Smart, Georgia, was No. 6. There is no arguing the unfriendly, Nick Saban wanna-be has made the Bulldogs a contender. In the 2017 season, they were a couple of plays away from winning the national championship. Georgia is a recruiting-rich state with 40-50 high D-I players every year. His recruiting budget should be a tank of gas.

Ed Orgeron jumped from No. 30 last season to No. 4 after LSU won the national championship. It’s amazing the guy who left Ole Miss under a huge cloud of embarrassment has turned his outlook and attitude around so much. Louisiana is another state full of great athletes, and all he needs is for another Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback to fall into his lap.

Most won’t be surprised that No. 1 was Alabama’s Satan. Nick Saban has won six national championships, including his first at LSU. But the guy named No. 2, Dabo Swinney, is breathing down his neck.

Saban has a 12-year head start, but Swinney — who started as an interim coach at Clemson — may be outrunning Saban these days.

Swinney is the only coach to beat Saban more than once with the national championship on the line.

Still, Alabama had myriad problems when Saban broke his word and left the Miami Dolphins for the Crimson Tide, and he has dominated the most powerful football league in the land since his second season.

It is a little surprising that sports writers would vote him No. 1, but none of those wags cover him on a regular basis, so they don’t have to worry about Saban’s temper tantrums and acid tongue.","Mark Stoops of Kentucky was the first SEC coach to show up, ranking No.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State students studying landscape architecture, architecture and graphic design are bringing home a national honor for their learning garden concept.

A cross-college consortium of MSU students conceptualized a suite of garden designs aimed at helping schools build learning gardens based on their educational needs. The Living Room: A Freeware Learning Garden Focused on Health, Food and Nutrition Education received an Honor Award for Student Collaboration at the American Society of Landscape Architects, or ASLA. The team, which included 10 landscape architecture students, 10 architecture students and one graphic design student, was recognized at the society’s recent virtual conference.

Cory Gallo, MSU associate professor of landscape architecture in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, served as faculty advisor for the group.

“For the fifth time since 2012, the design/build studio has earned a national design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Many of these awards have been in collaboration with architecture and graphic design faculty and students, including this most recent one,” Gallo said. “The society chose only 35 awards out of 560 applicants this year. The recognition is a continued testament to the unique cross-college process that has been ongoing at Mississippi State for the last decade.”

Gallo explained the garden’s concept was further illustrated in two proof-of-concept designs—one that has been installed at Galloway Elementary School in Jackson and another scheduled for installation at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU in spring 2021.

“The team worked with educators and stakeholders to tailor the design to each site’s individual needs. For instance, the garden at Galloway Elementary emphasized ample teaching space aligned around five themes including math, science and art, which allows teachers to use the garden for almost every subject. This ensures that the garden will be used for not just food education, but as an integral part of the classroom,” Gallo said.

Hans Herrmann, MSU associate professor in the School of Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art and Design, said students benefited from the collaborative hands-on experience.

“The first-hand feedback from trying to construct what was previously just an idea is something that traditional classroom instruction cannot approximate. Issues of material supply, site conditions, transportation logistics, tools and equipment all come into focus once you are standing on the site and realize that you’re the one who has to get the job done,” he said.

Herrmann said he was proud of how multiple disciplines joined together, including MSU alumni, to bridge between areas of expertise and gaps in experience.

“The work of these projects is more than just the hours in the field building and installing the gardens. It’s about building the team, taking ownership and responsibility for key components, and working with other organizations in Mississippi to make the state we call home that much better for the next generation,” he said.

In addition to the national award, the project was featured in a chapter of “Design-Build: Integrating Craft, Service, and Research through Applied Academic Practice,” a textbook by University of Washington Landscape Architecture Professor Daniel Winterbottom which was published by Routledge this year.

In addition to Gallo and Herrmann, Associate Professor Suzanne Powney in the Department of Art’s graphic design concentration advised the graphic student on the project. Associate Professor Ryan Walker in the College of Education’s Department of Curriculum, Instruction and Special Education consulted on the project as well.

Collaborators included The Fertile Ground Project, a Jackson-based program inspiring dialogue about food access; JH&H Architects in Flowood; Utah’s Pikus Concrete; and Pennsylvania’s Significant Developments. The garden at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU is funded through a grant from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi Foundation.

32,32,"Dec 2, 2018",The Commercial Dispatch,The W has dreams of baseball on campus,"Two years ago, Jason Trufant had a vision for the Mississippi University for Women’s return to intercollegiate athletics.

Trufant, who was hired as the school’s director of athletics, talked to groups in the Golden Triangle to increase awareness about the revival of women’s sports and the addition to men’s sports to the four-year school in Columbus. He discovered a fertile ground for growth in a community ripe with athletic tradition in numerous sports.

Trufant also realized baseball is one of the most popular sports in the Golden Triangle. He hopes the next step in The W’s evolution taps into that popularity and helps it build its fledgling baseball program.

On Wednesday, two years after one of his initial speaking engagements at the Kiwanis Club, Trufant was back to show off designs for construction of a baseball stadium on The W’s campus.

“With the focus of the project being private donations, it is really sky’s the limit to how fast you want to go,” Trufant said. “The main focus is the field. Once you get the field and fencing in, you just go. I think that’s important to have something physically on the ground to build around.”

Designed by PryorMorrow, of Columbus, Owls Park will be located south of Pohl Gymnasium. It will feature an artificial turf playing surface, LED stadium lights, seating for 500 behind home plate, and a press box. A 20-foot outfield fence will enclose the playing surface and help the facility fit nicely in between Pohl Gymnasium and Garrett Tennis Court.

Trufant said the first phase of the estimated $5 million complex will be the field, bullpens, dugouts, and lights. Seating, a press box, a brick entrance way and surrounding brick pillars, and parking will highlight phase two. The final phase will add and cover seating as well as add a main concourse, bathrooms, and concession to the grandstand.

Trufant said other amenities could be included to complete the project.

“I am excited to see how quickly and how productively we can put this together and do what is right for the student-athletes and the campus,” Trufant said.

Trufant praised Mike Taylor and PryorMorrow for their help in developing a vision for the venue, which he hopes will be one the community and people throughout the state will be able to use.

“When people see what the purpose of the facility is, I think they will understand what the end result needs to be,” Trufant said. “I don’t want to close the doors. We want to protect the investment, without a doubt, but I think it is important for as many people to be on campus as possible and to see what we can do as a university.”

Trufant said work already has started to raise money for the project. He said he would love to see a field on the campus “within a couple of years,” but he didn’t set a timetable. He said The W won’t do anything until it is ready to move forward.

To that end, Trufant praised the school administration and his staff for supporting the effort behind the construction of Owls Park.

“It’s all a tribute to the staff,” Trufant said. “They just work hard. Without the staff we have, we can’t be where we are. Without the administrative support that we have, we couldn’t be where we are.”

Earlier this year, The W completed installation of artificial turf at the Don Usher Softball Complex and renovated the venue for that program’s return to the field. The softball and baseball teams then wrapped up the 2017-18 school year by finishing fifth at the United States Collegiate Athletic Conference (USCAA) World Series in Pennsylvania.

“Baseball and softball in the South are as big as anything else,” Trufant said. “When you invest in those two sports, you not only see great numbers come to your institution for those two sports, but you also get the ancillary benefits of other students coming to see those events being played and to be a part of that culture. Investing like we have in athletics and continuing that progression will only do wonders for the university.”

In 2018-19, the return of women’s basketball and the addition of men’s basketball have generated added enthusiasm in an athletic department that now features 12 programs.

In 2019-20, Trufant said The W plans to add indoor and outdoor track and field for men and women and lacrosse for women. He said the addition of 185 student-athletes for the 12 sports currently offered has more than covered the costs of funding an athletic program that is working through the application phase of becoming a NCAA Division III member.

Trufant hopes the number of student-athletes will grow to 250-275 in the next three years as The W completes its roster of intercollegiate athletic programs. Until then, he will continue to raise awareness about sports at The W and to help make Owls Park a reality.

“When you start talking about building facilities, you have hit another level,” Trufant said. “You’re talking about creating a great place to play. We’re at that point. We’re adding structures rather than people. That’s pretty cool.”

33,33,"Jun 17, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,Mississippi State’s Nikki McCray-Penson continuing national recruiting push started by Vic Schaefer,"STARKVILLE — When Nikki McCray-Penson took over for former Mississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer in late April, a foundation for success had been set.

In eight years guiding the Bulldogs before his sudden departure for Texas, Schaefer earned three-straight trips to the Elite Eight or better and took MSU to back-to-back national title games in 2017 and 2018.

And while it remains to be seen what McCray-Penson’s on-court prowess will look like in Starkville, she’s also borrowed the national recruiting footprint that made Schaefer so successful.

“Vic and his staff have done a tremendous job of making this program very attractive and a place that players want to come and be a part of something special,” McCray-Penson told The Dispatch. “For me, it’s just continuing to build on that, build on it every single day, getting the top recruits in here every single day.”

Over the past three-plus weeks, MSU has earned commitments from five-star 2020 guard Madison Hayes — who required a second round of recruiting after Schaefer left for Austin — and 2021 four-stars guards KN’isha Godfrey and Mia Moore. All ranked in the top 100 of ESPNW’s HoopGurlz rankings for their respective classes, their varying geography speaks as much to McCray-Penson’s strategy as their actual skills.

Hayes, a native Ooltewah, Tennessee, a town just 30 minutes outside of Chattanooga, became the second-straight recipient of Tennessee’s Miss Basketball crown to commit to the Bulldogs and marked the first time MSU had corralled players from the Volunteer state in back-to-back years since at least 2007.

A Tennessee native and former player under longtime UT coach Pat Summitt, McCray-Penson’s roots in the area could offer a fertile recruiting ground up the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway as the Volunteer program hasn’t reached a Final Four since 2008.

“She’s the number one all-time leading scorer (in Tennessee high school basketball history) and I’m the third all-time,” Hayes told The Dispatch. “It’s really cool. You know, I didn’t expect to play for her but I think it’s a really cool connection that we have.”

Beyond Tennessee, the Bulldogs have quickly become players in Georgia — the home state of Moore and rising junior Jessika Carter. Like Tennessee, the hometown Bulldogs have seen their footprint shrink as they’ve reached just one Elite Eight since 2004 and haven’t been to the Final Four since 1999.

With that, Carter — who finished her high school career as the No. 5 ranked player in the state — has blossomed into a second team All-SEC performer in her two years in Starkville, while Moore sits as the No. 8 player in Georgia in the 2021 class and should take over point guard duties upon Myah Taylor’s graduation.

MSU is also in the recently released top-five for No. 15 overall player and No. 1-ranked Georgia native Kayla McPherson along with North Carolina, Georgia Tech, Arizona and North Carolina State.

Another key cog in MSU’s recent pillaging of the Peach State is assistant coach Scepter Brownlee. A one-time graduate assistant for Bruce Pearl at Tennessee, Brownlee spent four years as assistant athletic director and boys’ varsity basketball coach at King’s Ridge Christian School outside Atlanta after a four year-stint as a men’s assistant coach at Georgia State between 2007 and 2011.

“Mississippi State has built with the previous staff from a facility standpoint, from a resource standpoint,” Brownlee told The Dispatch. “Everything is in place that you need to be successful. We just want to continue to build on it and raise the standard, a new level of staff here at Mississippi State.”

McCray-Penson has also shown an ability to dip into states MSU hasn’t had recent success in. With Godrey’s commitment on May 29, she became the first Floridian to pledge to the Bulldogs since Iggy Allen in the class of 2016 and LaKaris Salter in the class of 2014.

Beyond Florida, McCray-Penson snagged former U18 German national team standout Charlotte Kohl and Bowling Green graduate transfer Caterrion Thompson in this year’s class — keeping recent international and graduate transfer market pipelines developed under Schaefer alive.

Entering the 2020 season, MSU will boast 12 players from 11 different states and two countries. And while that geographic diversity was developed under Schaefer, it stands to continue under McCray-Penson.

“He (succeeded) without having top recruits which sometimes is very hard,” McCray-Penson said. “But for me and my staff, we’ve just got to continue to build on the tradition and build on the legacy and bring the right players in here that fit our culture and fit Mississippi State’s mission statement.”","STARKVILLE — When Nikki McCray-Penson took over for former Mississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer in late April, a foundation for success had been set.

WASHINGTON — Rep. Bennie Thompson and other Democrats are urging the national party to invest more resources in the South, including Mike Espy’s bid for a Senate seat in Mississippi.

“He’s got a shot. Things need to fall into place,” said Thompson, the lone Democrat in Mississippi's congressional delegation. “He’s setting the building blocks … We just need to make sure at the end of the day we put our best foot forward. A lot of people are committed to doing all they can to help him.”

Espy, a former Democratic congressman and secretary of agriculture under the Clinton administration, is running in a special election to replace Republican Thad Cochran. Cochran retired in April citing health reasons.

Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who in April was sworn in to fill Cochran’s unexpired term, and state Republican Sen. Chris McDaniel are among the other top contenders.

Thompson and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, mostly Democrats, have been meeting with officials from the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee to ramp up efforts to win House races, including some in the South.

“The South as a whole is fertile ground for Democratic political growth,"" he said.

Thompson said he hopes the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which supports Democratic Senate candidates, will include the Mississippi race.

He said Espy has to make the case to the DSCC. “If I get asked, I’ll tell them they should,” Thompson said.

The DSCC has not said what role, if any, it will play in the Mississippi race.

National parties often watch to see if candidates have money, a structure and local support.

""Espy is a strong candidate and we are closely monitoring the race,'' said a DSCC aide.

Recent polls show Espy and Hyde-Smith running neck and neck in the race. One recent poll sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which supports Hyde-Smith, showed her ahead. McDaniel, a tea party favorite who lost to Cochran in 2014, has questioned the accuracy of the polls.

Political experts say Democrats have enough challenges this year. The DSCC is defending 10 Senate incumbents in states that President Trump won.

Trump also won Mississippi.

Still, some Democrats, including Thompson, point to the Senate race in neighboring Alabama where Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore last December in the red state. It was the first time in 25 years a Democrat won a Senate seat in Alabama.

African-American voters, who traditionally support Democratic candidates, are credited with helping Jones pull off the upset. Blacks are about 37 percent of Mississippi's population.

“The blueprint for what needs to happen can use Alabama as a takeoff,"" Thompson said.

Jones said he’s excited about the prospects of Democrats focusing more on the South. He said it’s important for Democratic candidates to talk about “kitchen table"" issues, including health care, jobs and education.

“Those are winning issues for Democrats,” he said.

Thompson said the DCCC, the DSCC and the Democratic National Committee need to come early and often to the South and not take minority voters there for granted.

“If we are the base voters for the Democrat Party, then you need to invest equally in those voters,"" he said. “We should not be (the focus) two weeks before the election. We should be (the focus) two years before the election.""

Jones said while he appreciated help from national Democrats, he relied on grassroots groups, mapped out his own strategy and focused on local issues.

“It is very, very important for local candidates in the South to be able to run the race that they need ... that they are true to themselves and true to what I think the Democratic Party stands for,” he said.

Winner—“AIM for CHangE,” or Advancing, Inspiring, Motivating for Community Health through Extension, submitted by Masey Smith, project manager for the Department of Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion, and Associate Professor David Buys. FSNHP students, faculty and staff partnered with local medical facilities and food networks to reduce and prevent obesity in Mississippi through promotion of healthy nutrition standards, physical activity, food service guidelines and active living. The project led to the development of a food pantry in the state’s most food-insecure area, Holmes County, where more than 269,800 pounds of food have been distributed to 13,490 households since May 2020.

Honorable Mention—“Economic Planning and Analysis for Mississippi Communities,” submitted by MSU Extension Professor of Agricultural Economics Alan Barefield. This project allowed undergraduate students, guided by MSU Extension faculty, to provide analyses of individual issues for stakeholders in Mississippi. With assistance from the Mississippi Development Authority, elected officials and other community leaders, the project aimed to provide unbiased, research-based analyses using appropriate methodologies to communities; presented MSU as an unbiased, research-based source to assist communities in addressing current issues; and provided undergraduate students with exposure to research and outreach methodologies and issues, while also giving students the experience to interact with community leaders.

In the past, students in the course volunteered to gain hands-on experience in building construction working alongside a community partner. This fall, the course became designated in community-engaged learning and available to more than 200 students campuswide. Students continue volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, but now are developing content for a “How Your House Works” booklet for new homeowners and introducing them to tips on maintenance and more. Students also created a calendar with monthly home maintenance reminders.

Honorable Mention—“ECE Toy Adaptation Program,” submitted by MSU Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Jean Mohammadi-Aragh. Partnering with MSU’s T.K. Martin Center for Technology and Disability, the project provides hands-on, community-focused learning opportunities through modification of electronic toys. ECE students, faculty and staff create interactive toys that enable children with developmental disabilities to learn concepts such as letters and numbers and gain fundamental experiences such as cause-and-effect from pushing a modified button or switch to operate a toy. These toys help develop motor skills, communication skills and independence in children. The electronically modified toys are donated to the T.K. Martin Center and are used in therapy sessions by speech pathologists and occupational therapists, as well as given to some families during home visits.

Winner—“The Living Room Learning Garden,” submitted by Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture Cory Gallo. Teaming with Fertile Ground of Jackson, the project aimed to develop a learning garden for Galloway Elementary School in Jackson. At Galloway, MSU students and faculty worked alongside a coalition of community members, partners, school administrators, educators and experts to develop the garden. The team met monthly to conduct workshops with school children to help engage them with the garden’s design. Faculty also worked with MSU’s Office of Research and Economic Development and Starkville Oktibbeha School District to create a new learning garden for the district’s Partnership School. This garden is currently under development with plans to open this year.

Honorable Mention—“The Emmett Till Memorial: CE Studio,” submitted by Assistant Professor of Architecture Silvina Lopez Barrera. MSU students and faculty partnered with the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, which works to tell the story of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, and explores ways to facilitate racial healing. The project goal was to design a memorial in honor of Till at the Graball Landing site at the Tallahatchie River’s confluence with the Black Bayou where Till’s body was found. The commission has attempted to commemorate the nationally recognized site since 2008, but it has been repeatedly vandalized. During the project, the class visited sites related to Till’s history and engaged discussion with students and community members regarding how the project’s design will contribute to future site development. Nearly 40 student design proposals were shown at the Emmett Till Interpretative Center in Sumner.

Winner—“Any Given Child Meridian,” submitted by Assistant Professor Jeffrey Leffler, who also serves as interim graduate coordinator of MSU-Meridian’s Division of Education. The project began in 2016 when Meridian was chosen by the national John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to locally begin Any Given Child, a Pre-K through 8th grade arts integration partnership. The project strived to ensure equity of access to the arts for any child in the city. MSU students, faculty and staff aimed to complete five goals: expand and sustain arts education for all students; ensure active parental and community understanding and support of arts education for all students; sequentially build integration of the arts through professional development of school personnel, artists and arts organizations; create a funding model and organizational structure to sustain arts education in the Meridian Public School District; and continually assess Any Given Child implementation and impacts through collaborative data analysis.

Honorable Mention—“Low Impact Development Gulf Coast: Sustainable Stormwater Management” submitted by Tracy Wyman, a landscape architect with MSU’s Gulf Coast Community Design Center. An outreach and education initiative under the research arm of the College of Architecture, Art and Design, this project responded to the connection between upland management strategies and downstream impacts on low-lying areas and natural waterbodies. LID managed stormwater near the source and designed a series of treatment options that slow the flow of stormwater so it can better infiltrate the soil. MSU students, faculty and staff members worked to prevent pollutants from entering natural water bodies while building healthy soils and creating a pleasing aesthetic. The project engaged local planning and design professionals across the three coastal counties in the Gulf Coast region, engaged high school students in a hands-on education program, and exposed students to a variety of career choices in science, technology, engineering and math.

36,36,"Oct 24, 2020",Essence,Mississippi Health Official: Maskless White People Are Responsible For Spike In COVID-19 Cases,"Maskless white people in Mississippi are responsible for the spike in COVID-19 cases, according to Dr. Thomas Dobbs, a State Health Officer.

“We’ve seen a pretty remarkable shift because early on, African Americans accounted for basically two-thirds, or 60 percent or more, of cases and deaths,” Dobbs said on CNN. “Then over the summer, and especially going into the fall, we’ve seen that shift basically upside down. Sixty-percent of new cases are caucasians and the deaths are nearing that also.”

Dobbs said that the state has been been working hard on safety measures, which have found “more fertile ground in the Black community.”

“As far as the case trends, we have had really pretty good uptake by a lot of folks in the Black community with masking and social distancing,” Dobbs said. “We’ve worked very aggressively to make sure that the Black community understands where the risks are and what can be done to prevent that. “And I just will say … I think big parts of the white community, especially in areas that maybe weren’t as hard-affected (previously), have not been as compliant or engaged actively with social distancing and masking. And I think that does make a difference.”

According to Dobbs, there are white parents sponsoring youth events, dances, and parties. Additionally, get togethers and gathering in bars have helped to undermine the state’s efforts to control the spread of COVID-19.

As of Friday, October 23, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported 1,212 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths, bringing the state’s totals to 115,088 cases and 3,255 deaths, WDAM reports.

As white people continue to disproportionately endanger themselves and their neighbors, Black people continue to be most at risk from serious COVID-19 complications.

Mississippi is among the southern states that have opted not to expand Medicaid, but whose governors rushed to reopen businesses even though no vaccine or herd immunity had been established, ESSENCE previously reported.

“We—who were already neglected by states who chose profit and partisan politics over the health and well-being of our communities, who are disproportionately impacted by poverty, white supremacist violence, health disparities and more—are seeing less access to emergency care, while the few facilities that remain are becoming the primary source of care for our people,” Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, Executive Director of the Highlander Research & Education Center, wrote in March. “We’re seeing health care providers leave communities because of the closure of rural hospitals, gaps in specialty care expanding, job loss, and so much more, as the need for services increases beyond our ability to provide them.”

Those facts have not changed.

CNN

Less than one month after Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves irresponsibly ended the state’s mask mandate on September 30, he has reinstated the mandate for nine counties, WJTV reports.

Still, the Republican governor continues to politicize his COVID-19 response and sharing misleading information about the health of the state he claims to lead, tweeting Friday, “17% decrease in Mississippi COVID cases this week compared to last week. Even as cases surge in most states. Keep up the good work! We can do this without going crazy on government interventions—people get it! Virtue signaling is useless, but limited action in key areas works!”

According to CNN, President Donald Trump, who is known to be anti-science, including in his COVID-19 response, won Mississippi in 2016’s election by 17.8 percentage points.

Perhaps, the maskless white people endangering their own lives and others are following their president’s lead. Trump, who held a super-spreader event at the White House while not wearing a mask, called his own COVID-19 diagnosis a “blessing from God.”

Bloomberg. Anchorage, Alaska, and Coral Springs, Florida, were also named as grant winners earlier this month.

The funds will support the project “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue About Food Access,” which aims to inform policy related to nutrition by using art as a medium to communicate the complexities of the issue in the city. Local and national artists, landscape architects, filmmakers, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, and community members will be invited to collaborate on a citywide exhibition featuring installations and performances, as well as other programming.

The initiative will activate public streets, community gardens, a local elementary school, and a vacant building, which will be converted into exhibition space and a food lab with a pop-up kitchen, to address challenges stemming from the proliferation of fast food restaurants in the area. According to the Clarion-Ledger, many areas of Jackson are considered food swamps where there is almost no access to grocery stores. Due to the overabundance of fast food, the city has the second highest obesity rate in the nation and the highest rate for children between the ages of ten and seventeen.

“The city is overjoyed to have been selected in this process,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement. “This was a highly competitive grant where over two hundred cities around the world applied to be a part of this Public Art Challenge. And so, to be able to aid in the aesthetic appeal of the city while delivering a message of healthy eating for the citizens of Jackson is a truly remarkable opportunity and we are ecstatic and look forward to seeing this project come into fruition.”

Among those participating in the project are artists Adrienne Domnick and Kara Walker; filmmakers Keegan Kuhn and Roderick Red; Mark Bittman, the country’s first food-focused op-ed columnist for the New York Times and a faculty member of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health; chef Nick Wallace; clean eating advocate Ron Finley; and landscape architect Walter Hood.

39,39,"Apr 18, 2018",Vox,Democrats have a legitimate shot to win the Mississippi Senate race,"This year’s unlikeliest competitive Senate race might be Mississippi.

There, in the Deep South, 80-year-old Republican Sen. Thad Cochran retired after four decades in the Senate. He was replaced by a new senator, Cindy Hyde-Smith, appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant, who had been in close contact with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as it became clear that Cochran’s health would not allow him to serve much longer. Cochran’s seat will now be on the ballot in November — and hard-right conservatives have had their eye on Mississippi for months.

Could it be Alabama all over again?

Conservative insurgent Chris McDaniel, a former state senator with ties to the neo-Confederate movement, was prepared to primary Mississippi’s other Republican senator at Steve Bannon’s urging. But now he’s running for Cochran’s open seat.

McDaniel already challenged Cochran in a bitterly contested 2014 Republican primary — it involved a break-in and a suicide — and to this day, his supporters contend that election was stolen from him in part because many of the black voters in the state lined up behind Cochran.

But even if Hyde-Smith prevails over McDaniel among Republicans, as recent polls suggest she would, Democrats could still make the race competitive. A new poll conducted for Y’all Politics, a well-read conservative news site in the state, showed McDaniel significantly behind Hyde-Smith — and found Hyde-Smith leading the top Democrat in the race, former congressman Mike Espy, by just six points.

“Mississippi is a red state, but I think most people would be surprised to learn that [John] McCain only won the state by 13 points and [Mitt] Romney by 12. It is actually substantially less red than Alabama,” Sean Trende, an elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, told me in an email. When you add it all up, Mississippi is a “lighter load than Alabama.”

Then you have the Trump factor. For now, the president has refused to back Bryant’s choice for the Cochran seat. Mississippi’s Senate race should be a familiar drama — the establishment versus the far-right wing, McConnell versus Bannon, with a credible Democrat waiting to run against whoever makes it out alive.

Chris McDaniel versus the Republican establishment, explained

First things first: The Mississippi race will be a jungle primary. That means every candidate runs in the first race on Election Day in November. If one candidate gets 50 percent of the total vote, they win. But if they don’t — and it seems unlikely, with a strong Democratic candidate and a fractured GOP field — the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election that same month. (One of them could be the Democrat Espy — whom we’ll get to in a bit.)

McDaniel was originally going to challenge Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, a favorite target of alt-right mastermind and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. McDaniel had discussed his Wicker challenge with Bannon before announcing, Mississippi Today reported last fall, and his potential candidacy had received favorable coverage from Breitbart, Bannon’s former employer. But McDaniel switched over to the open Cochran race after the senator said he would step down in April.

It probably doesn’t make much difference to Bannon, who clearly sees Mississippi as fertile ground for the alt-right populist revolution he is still trying to get off the ground.

“Mitch McConnell is a literal anchor tied to the hips of folks like Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran,” Andy Surabian, a Bannon adviser, told NBC News last fall. “We expect the anti-establishment wave we are seeing across the country today to hit Mississippi like a tsunami in 2018 and beyond.”

Bryant’s pick to replace Cochran on April 1 was Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state’s agriculture commissioner. She is Mississippi’s first woman senator.

McDaniel had once upon a time lobbied Bryant to name him as Cochran’s replacement, the Washington Post reported, but the governor was not interested.

There is a lot of bad blood between McDaniel and the Republican establishment, left over from the 2014 primary. Bryant even took a swing at McDaniel after the state senator announced he would switch from the Wicker to the Cochran race.

“This opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,” Bryant told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger.

The newspaper reported that Bryant was looking for a candidate who was particularly well suited to beating McDaniel. The governor settled on Hyde-Smith, but the White House and Washington Republicans weren’t exactly on board with that choice. Politico reported that Trump won’t campaign for or endorse Hyde-Smith because the White House is worried her history as a Democrat (she switched parties in 2010) could make her vulnerable. McDaniel, right on cue, has already begun attacking Hyde-Smith for her past in the other party.

The most recent polling suggests Hyde-Smith is building a substantial advantage over McDaniel, though. The Clarion Ledger reported this week that Espy and Hyde-Smith were pulling away from the rest of the field based on the Y’all Politics survey of the race:

Democrat Mike Espy: 33.1 percent

Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith: 33 percent

Republican Chris McDaniel: 12.8 percent

Democrat Jason Shelton: 6.2 percent

(Another recent poll, commissioned by Espy’s campaign, found the Democrat and Hyde-Smith as the top two candidates, though McDaniel had a stronger showing at 21 percent.)

The establishment is hellbent on stopping McDaniel and they might be succeeding. Which brings us back to 2014.

Let’s remember how absolutely surreal the 2014 campaign was

McDaniel has to be taken seriously because he mounted a very credible challenge against Cochran in 2014. Let’s start with the math: In the first round of the GOP’s jungle primary that year, McDaniel actually got more votes (49.5 percent) than Cochran (49 percent); a man named Thomas Carey got the remaining votes. But McDaniel did not get the needed 50 percent, so he and Cochran had a rematch.

In that showdown, Cochran narrowly prevailed over McDaniel, 51 percent to 49 percent, but not without a lot of bitterness and allegations of wrongdoing on both sides.

But those are the vote totals. That’s not the memorable part. In brief — and to understand why Bryant and other establishment Republicans are so hell-bent on beating McDaniel this year — here is your unofficial rundown of the 2014 Mississippi primary, courtesy of Talking Points Memo:

A 26-year-old blogger and McDaniel supporter nicknamed “Constitutional Clayton” broke into the nursing home where Cochran’s wife resides and took pictures of her for an attack ad accusing the senator of infidelity with one of his aides.

That blogger later went to jail for the break-in conspiracy. On a more tragic note, one of his alleged conspirators killed himself during the investigation.

Chuck Johnson, the infamous conservative raconteur, accused the Cochran campaign of bribing black voters to support the senator.

Johnson was later investigated by the Mississippi attorney general for his report and allegations that he actually bribed a source of the accusations he made against Cochran.

But after the election, the McDaniel campaign did file a lawsuit accusing the Cochran camp of soliciting Democratic votes, which they said would invalidate the results. The suit was eventually rejected by the state Supreme Court.

In other words, the McDaniel campaign tried to use the specter of black voters to delegitimize an election result — a problematic tactic, to say the least, given the state senator’s history of racially charged remarks.

The 2014 race is still a sore point for everybody involved. Just this year, McDaniel said:

“What I have is a situation in which I’m running for the same seat I ran for in 2014 — the seat we felt we won in 2014. Now God had other plans for that, obviously, and that’s okay and we accept that. All I’m asking for now is to be allowed to finish that term that we ran for in 2014.”

And that explains equally well, on the establishment side of the equation, why Bryant and other Republican leaders are so intent on defeating McDaniel again. McDaniel and his supporters had maligned Cochran, a titan of Mississippi Republican politics, and deployed dirtier-than-dirty tactics to try to unseat him.

The hypothetical path for another Democratic win in the Deep South

All of this leads to a pretty serious opening for Democrats. So who is the Democrat in this race?

Former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy — who comes with some of his own baggage after being acquitted of bribery charges in the 1990s — has already announced that he will run for Cochran’s seat with the backing of Democrats in the state. The 64-year-old represented the Jackson area in Congress for six years before serving as President Bill Clinton’s secretary of agriculture from 1993 to 1994.

But he was forced to step down amid an ethics investigation. Allegations were made that he improperly received airplane and sports tickets. Espy was eventually acquitted on all charges, but it more or less ended his career in politics; he has been out of public office for nearly 25 years, spending the past decade as a private attorney.

Espy looks likely to lock up one of the spots for the runoff election. That means the initial vote will function as a quasi-Republican primary: The top two GOP candidates will be vying to come in first or second and earn the right to face Espy. And with Democratic turnout up all around the country, that could put Espy on the map in a real way.

“I think against a more traditional Southern Republican, you get maybe something that looks like the presidential numbers, tightened a bit for turnout,” Trende told me.

To his point: for now, according to the Y’all Politics poll, Hyde-Smith is leading with 42 percent of the vote to Espy’s 36 percent.

If Hyde-Smith holds onto her lead over McDaniel, she has to be considered the favorite against Espy in the runoff. Maybe things will be a little closer than usual. It could get even more competitive if Espy runs a strong campaign or if the national environment becomes even worse for Republicans.

If McDaniel were to win and face Espy in a one-on-one runoff, things start to get really interesting. The poll cited by the Clarion Ledger found the Democrat with a 43 percent to 24 percent lead over McDaniel.

Espy certainly starts with some challenges: He could have lost his skills in retail politics, he might not be adept at fundraising, etc. But if he shows up in game shape, he could have some real advantages in Mississippi against McDaniel.

The conservative candidate has a troubling list of, shall we say, racially charged rhetoric and affiliating with more openly racist people:

He spoke at a neo-Confederate conference in 2013.

He recently appeared on a radio show with a host who traffics in anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracies.

He has blamed “hip-hop” for gun violence, saying that it is “morally bankrupt” and destroys community values,

TPM had a long rundown in 2014 of McDaniel’s various remarks about reparations and “mamacitas.”

With some solid fundraising and spending, Espy could turn out more black voters — already about one-third of the state’s electorate — and he could then bring the race down to single digits, Trende told me.

“At that point, you’re really not talking about convincing that many whites to either state home or vote Democrat because of McDaniel’s racialized statements,” he said.

Espy, it should be noted, said kind words about Cochran as he announced his candidacy, and the Clarion-Ledger wrote that Espy has long been considered the model for the kind of black candidate who could win crossover white voters in Mississippi.

We’re a long way from an Alabama-style upset coming to fruition in its neighbor state. But the state may have the right ingredients.","But even if Hyde-Smith prevails over McDaniel among Republicans, as recent polls suggest she would, Democrats could still make the race competitive.

40,40,"Dec 2, 2019",History,Ancient Native Americans Once Thrived in Bustling Urban Centers,"Long before the arrival of European explorers, soldiers and settlers in North America, the portion of the continent north of Mexico was inhabited by as many as 18 million native people. And contrary to the popular perception of American Indians living a nomadic existence, many of the continent’s aboriginal inhabitants lived in thriving urban centers.

One settlement, Cahokia in modern-day Illinois, had a population of 20,000 at its peak around 1100-1150 A.D. Around that same period in time, New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon was the center of a sophisticated culture that erected what were the most massive buildings on the continent, until the rise of skyscrapers built from steel girders in the late 1800s.

Those urban centers were part of what historians Lisa Krissoff Boehm and Steven Hunt Corey have described as “a landscape rich with its own history—a land shaped by diverse peoples living in varying patterns of settlement.”

Cahokia Sprawled Over Five Square Miles

8 Gallery 8 Images

Like cities in other parts of the world, Cahokia, which sprawled over an area of about five square miles, developed in a highly desirable spot. The settlement was situated along a flood plain that provided fertile soil for agriculture, with nearby hickory forests to provide wood and other raw materials as well as wildlife to hunt, according to Lori Belknap, site manager for the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site.

Cahokia also had convenient access to the nearby Mississippi River, which its residents—a people known as the Mississippian culture—navigated in large dugout canoes. “It likely was a trading center,” Belknap says.

Like a modern city with suburbs, Cahokia’s outer edge was a residential area, consisting of houses made from sapling frames lined with clay walls and covered by prairie grass roofs. Further inside was a log palisade wall and guard towers, which protected a central ceremonial precinct of the site, including Monks Mound, the Grand Plaza and 17 other mounds. More than 100 mounds extended more than a mile outside the wall in all directions. Some served as bases for what probably were important community buildings, while other cone-shaped mounds functioned as burial sites. Still others apparently were markers that delineated the city’s boundaries, according to Belknap.

At the center was the 100-foot-tall Monks Mound, the largest earthen mound in North America, which had four terraces and a ramp or stairway leading up from the ground. From the top of the mound, one could take in a panoramic view of Cahokia and its surrounding realm.

One of the most remarkable things about Cahokia is that it appears to have been carefully planned around 1000 A.D., with a rectangular-shaped Grand Plaza whose core design mirrors the native vision of the cosmos, according to archaeologist Thomas Emerson. From the beginning, the city’s builders had “grandiose visions of what Cahokia would be,” Emerson explains. “It did not grow by slow accretion through time.”

The events that led to the deliberate building of Cahokia and the rapid growth of its population remain unclear. “A religious prophet? The immigration of a foreign elite group? The introduction of maize?” Emerson says. “The options seem endless, but we have few answers right now.”

Cahokia’s decline, which began around 1250 or 1300, and culminated in the site’s abandonment by 1350, are similarly mysterious. A recent study suggests the settlement’s demise was linked to climate change since a decrease in rainfall would have affected the Mississippians’ ability to grow their staple crop of maize. Others think that the sheer size and diversity of the Cahokian population may have led to irreconcilable rifts.

“It was a large population, composed of immigrants from the midcontinent who brought very different practices and beliefs to the city,” Emerson says. “The management of differences requires a strong social and political consensus within a group. If that consensus collapses, societies will fragment into their smaller groups that existed based on kinship, ethnicity, religious beliefs, residential propinquity, shared economic goals, etc.”

In New Mexico, the Chaco Canyon settlement flourished between 850 and 1250 A.D. Over the years, researchers have come up with wildly varying estimates of the center’s peak population, from around 2,000 to as many as 25,000, according to a 2005 National Park Service report.

Chaco Canyon appears to have been the ceremonial, trade and administrative hub of a network of neighboring communities, some as far as 60 miles away. A 2016 study by University of Colorado Boulder researcher Larry Benson found that Chaco Canyon’s salty soil wasn’t good for growing corn and beans, so the settlement had to import food and other resources from those places. Those communities were connected by an extensive network of roads and an irrigation system, according to Boehm and Corey.

Builders in Chaco Canyon developed sophisticated stone masonry construction techniques that allowed them to erect 150 multi-story structures, some as tall as five to six stories in height, with hundreds of rooms. In addition to stone, the builders used about 240,000 trees, some harvested from the Chuska Mountains about 50 miles to the west, according to a 2015 study by University of Arizona scientists.

The great houses, as these massive structures were called, probably weren’t dwellings, but rather public buildings used when people of the region gathered for ceremonies or to engage in commerce, according to NPS.

“Elite chiefs constructed the great houses to demonstrate their authority,” Benson, an adjoint curator of anthropology at the University of Colorado Boulder’s Museum of Natural History, says. “However, they did not live in the canyon. Instead, they lived in wetter more productive regions at the periphery of the San Juan Basin where they oversaw the production of foodstuffs and the harvesting of mammals.”

In 2017, DNA analysis of remains suggested that the settlement may have been founded and ruled over a period of more than 300 years by dynastic elite that controlled the ritual practices at Pueblo Bonito, the 600-room structure that was the settlement’s most important building.

Like Cahokia, the Chaco Canyon settlement was abandoned eventually. Some have suggested that people in the area cut down too much of the forests, leading to erosion and destruction of farming. But a 2014 study by University of New Mexico researchers concluded that there wasn’t evidence to support that scenario.","And contrary to the popular perception of American Indians living a nomadic existence, many of the continent’s aboriginal inhabitants lived in thriving urban centers.

41,41,"Jul 23, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,How Mississippi State is tapping into Florida in the 2021 and 2022 classes,"STARKVILLE — Mississippi State has garnered a Sunshine state of mind on the recruiting trail in recent months.

Less than a week after the Bulldogs earned a pledge from three-star linebacker Timar Rogers, MSU now has two players from Florida amongst its 11 commitments in the class of 2021. And while Florida boasts a fertile recruiting ground, it’s a state staffers in Starkville have had little success recruiting until recently.

Under Joe Moorhead’s tenure at MSU, the Bulldogs never signed more than a single recruit from Florida in either of the 2018 or 2019 classes. The 2020 class, which was largely compiled by Moorhead’s staff, boasted one Florida native in three-star defensive end Jamari Stewart, but he was added after Leach took over.

Before Moorhead, Dan Mullen had comparable success in the Sunshine State. Mullen never enrolled more than one Florida player in any of his first seven classes — including three years in which none were signed. Following the string of success MSU enjoyed between 2014 and 2015, the Bulldogs did bring in five players from Florida between the 2016 and 2017 classes, but that momentum came to a lull after Mullen, ironically, took the head coaching job at Florida.

As for Leach, he signed 11 players from Florida between the 2014 and 2019 classes during his time at Washington State compared to Mullen’s eight.

“Get the best ones closest that you can and then extend it out as you have to, but don’t ignore real quality guys who are really interested in your program,” Leach said of his recruiting philosophy in February. “Sometimes a relative went there, sometimes a guy is just curious, sometimes someone really likes a major there, that type of thing, but no matter where they’re at, if they’re really interested in you, I don’t think you’d ignore them.”

Part of the explanation for MSU’s recent dip into Florida is the connections on the new coaching staff. Early in his career, Leach recruited the state while an assistant for Hal Mumme at Iowa Wesleyan and later Valdosta State, a Division II school less than a half-hour drive from the Florida border in southern Georgia.

Outside receivers coach Steve Spurrier Jr. also spent time as a graduate assistant in Gainesville during the mid-1990s and recruited the state while an assistant for his father and longtime Florida coach Steve Spurrier at South Carolina.

“Georgia can’t take everybody in Georgia and Texas, and Texas A&M can’t take all the good players in Texas,” 247sports Director of Recruiting Steve Wiltfong told The Dispatch in April. “There’s so many good players, and if you evaluate well you can really become a good football team recruiting those three states (Georgia, Texas and Florida).”

Boasting a breadth of connections to Florida, MSU’s 2021 and 2022 class could have a certain flare for the state. Rogers and high school teammate Myzell Williams out of Deland are already on board amongst the 2021s. MSU has also offered 39 Florida prospects in the 2021 class and another 14 in the class of 2022. By contrast the Bulldogs have offered 21 players from Mississippi in the 2021 class and 10 in 2022.

As for actual prospects who could add to MSU’s impending classes, the Bulldogs have been heavily involved with 2022 safety Jaydon Hodge out of Forest High School in Ocala. MSU is also in the running for 2021 offensive guard Kimo Makaneole.

This isn’t to say MSU is simply going to abandon recruiting Mississippi and that the Bulldogs will suddenly have an influx of classes comprised exclusively of Florida products. Rather, Leach noted that he and his staff’s past stops would allow MSU to recruit more nationally and thus far, that’s come to fruition.

“The good news is there’s talent everywhere,” MSU safeties coach and former Texas recruiting coordinator Jason Washington told The Dispatch in February. “And these kids are getting out and going different places, and so when they step on campus, we want to make this feel like home for them and gain a relationship and a love for our coaches and the players that are around here and the city of Starkville. From there, shoot, sell everything else and give them a goal and a light at the end of the tunnel.”","STARKVILLE — Mississippi State has garnered a Sunshine state of mind on the recruiting trail in recent months.

Renovations to Mississippi Coliseum Completed

Mississippi Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner Andy Gipson announced in August that work had finished five months ahead of schedule on renovations to the Mississippi Coliseum at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds, partially due to event cancellations from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Wier Boerner Allin Architecture designed the $2.2-million renovation project, which began in October 2019 and was originally planned to finish by January 2021. Renovations included repairing and painting floors and walls with abrasive, slip-resistant paint, installing new seating, and adding handrails and reflectors.

The Mississippi Coliseum is attached to the new Mississippi Trade Mart building. The state Legislature consolidated the Mississippi Fair Commission into the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce effective July 1, 2020.

Sunshine for All Program

The fruit-supplying company Dole launched its ""Sunshine for All"" program in Jackson in August. The program aims to provide better nutrition for 1 billion people in underserved communities by 2025.

As part of the program, Dole will partner with Jackson-based food organization Up in Farms to support their farm-to-table training center. Dole will also distribute fresh produce and smoothies to areas in Jackson that are considered food deserts, meaning they lack easy access to grocery stores and healthy foods.

The Sharing the Sunshine Meals & Nutrition Education Program will provide educational courses for children and families on healthy cooking and affordable shopping for healthy food, as well as cooking classes for adults. Dole will also host a Kids Cooking Camp to provide hands-on lessons in basic food preparation for children.

Dole will also host pop-up farmers markets and provide healthy meals on alternating weekends at Boys and Girls Club locations in Jackson.

Local organizations participating in the Sunshine for All program include the Fertile Ground Project, the Jackson Public Schools Administration and the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

JXN Icons Mural

Groundbreaking for Museum to Market Trail

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and other officials hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Museum to Market multi-use path in July.

In 2011, the City of Jackson received a $1.1-million federal grant through the Mississippi Department of Transportation and the Central Mississippi Planning and Development District to construct the planned walking, running and biking trail.

The Museum to Market Trail will include construction of 2.14 miles of new multi-use path or replacement sidewalk from the Mississippi Farmers Market on High Street to the Mississippi Children's Museum on Highland Drive.

The $1,579,850 project also includes a new pedestrian bridge over a creek and the conversion of an abandoned railway into a compliant 10-foot-wide multi-use path from Spengler Street to Laurel Street.

The Federal Highway Administration and the Mississippi Department of Transportation funded the project. Residents can follow the progress of the project on the museum trail's Facebook page.

Road Repair and Repaving

Thirteen Jackson streets are on a repaving list for 2020, Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba announced in July, as part of an effort to reverse the degrading of road infrastructure in the City. The streets include Canton Mart Road, Old Canton Road, Northside Drive, Pear Orchard Road, Lakeland Drive, N. Gallatin Street, Jefferson Street, Bailey Avenue, Ellis Avenue, Belvedere Drive, McDowell Road and Oak Forest Drive.

The One Percent Sales Tax Commission, which administers a 1% sales tax increase Jackson voters approved in 2014, is funding the repaving, which will cost $5.3 million.

Mayor Lumumba's administration has, in the last three years, poured $15 million into ""south Jackson alone"" to repair bridges and repave roads, he said.

Russell C. Davis Planetarium Renovations Ahead

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced renovations to the Russell C. Davis Planetarium in July.

A roof leak and the resulting interior damage forced the planetarium to close in April 2018. With the damage repaired, the City is preparing to renovate the building for the first time in 40 years and plans to reopen the planetarium by April 2022.

The planetarium ran a fundraising campaign and sold limited-edition merchandise to raise money for design work, exhibition design and build-out.

Andrew Jackson Statue at City Hall Being Replaced

In August, the Jackson City Council authorized Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to legally remove and relocate the statue of former President Andrew Jackson from City Hall.

Mayor Lumumba said he supports the move and wants a newly commissioned statue of Medgar Evers as the replacement. Evers, a civil-rights hero, lived in Jackson before his assassination in 1963. Jackson, on the other hand, was a white supremacist who led the removal of Native Americans from their lands.

The resolution passed 5-1, with Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote as the lone opposition and Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps absent.

UMMC Hospital Visitation Restricted to Curb COVID-19 Spread

Effective Monday at noon, the University of Mississippi Medical Center will restrict visitors at its Jackson-based hospitals in an effort to lessen the spread of the novel coronavirus and help ensure the safety of patients, visitors, employees and students.

As of Saturday, the Mississippi State Department of Health had announced six presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Mississippi cases currently cover the counties of Forrest, Leflore, Copiah and Pearl River. It is generally accepted that Mississippi is experiencing community spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus

Medical Center leadership is enacting a revised visitor policy for all UMMC hospitals. The primary restrictions being put in place are:

Adult patients are not permitted to have visitors except in certain circumstances according to hospital visitation policies.

Pediatric patients (Children’s of Mississippi) are permitted to have only two adult visitors, but both must be parents, guardians or caregivers.

Temporary visitor restrictions are already in effect for UMMC Grenada and UMMC Holmes County. The Jackson hospitals are University Hospital, Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants, Batson Children’s Hospital and Conerly Critical Care Hospital.

Also, beginning Monday, there will be only two entrances for patients and visitors of the Jackson-based hospitals:

The front entrance of University Hospital (under the overhang facing State Street near Garage A)

The side entrance to Wiser Hospital for Women and Children (under the overhang facing Garage B)

Patients and visitors will be screened at those two entrances. Patients who exhibit symptoms associated with respiratory illness (fever, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath) or report they have recently visited an area identified as a location experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak will receive further evaluation to determine next steps. Visitors that meet any of these criteria will not be allowed to enter under any circumstances.

Along with the person doing the screening, also present at these two entrances will be a Campus Police officer and a patient experience representative. The entrances for University Heart, Adult and Pediatric EDs and the Pavilion will be open, but will not provide patients and visitors access to hospitals.

Restrictions and entry screenings also apply to patients and visitors needing to enter a hospital for a hospital-based clinic or procedure appointments.

Conversation: Heather McTeer Toney

Maureen Nandini Mitra Winter 2020

An upbeat, smart, powerhouse — that was my first impression of Heather McTeer Toney as I watched her onstage taking on a former Trump administration EPA official on the issue of climate change at the Society of Environmental Journalists’ conference in Fort Collins, Colorado this past October. It was easy to see why this native of Greenville, Mississippi was elected her town’s first African-American, first female, and youngest-ever mayor back in 2004 when she was only 27. And why, after two terms as mayor — during which she worked to improve Greenville’s water supply and infrastructure, and helped reduce the city’s debt — she was appointed administrator for the EPA’s Southeast Region by President Barack Obama.

A lawyer by training, McTeer Toney has received numerous awards and honors over the past two decades for her advocacy on multiple social issues including domestic violence, unfair labor practices, and environmental and climate justice. Currently she is the national field director for Moms Clean Air Force, an organization of over one million parents committed to fighting climate change and air pollution.

When I caught up with McTeer Toney over the phone a few weeks after the conference, our hour-long conversation reinforced my first impression. She is a powerhouse indeed. We talked about everything from fighting gender and racial stereotypes, to climate change as an election issue, to the importance of community and faith in the environmental movement. An excerpt.

What first got you interested in environmental issues?

That’s so hard to say. I’m from a part of the country where just naturally you’re involved with the environment just because it’s a very agrarian society. The Mississippi Delta is surrounded by the world’s most fertile soil and has a history of farming. [The environment] was a part of everything that we did — from people having gardens in their backyards, to picking pecans in the fall, and respecting the Mississippi River and how powerful it was.

The way that we talk about the environment in today’s words is not sufficient to describe my interaction, or people that I know from the South — people of color’s —interaction with environment. Because when you look up What is an environmentalist? if you just Google what it looks like, it’s very singular. It’s a lot of white people and hugging trees. That’s just not my idea and image of an environmentalist. For me it’s people who are connected to land and soil in ways that are both good and bad, and that’s been my connection and passion all my life.

So basically, what you are saying is that you grew up close to the soil and didn’t feel any separation between self and environment per se?

Right, even though my parents were middle-class professionals — my dad was an attorney, my mom a schoolteacher. I think that we’re all environmentalists in our own way, especially coming from the part of the country where I come from, where people’s entire livelihood, whether you are a farmer or not, is dependent upon how the environment is growing and thriving.

Maybe I should rephrase the question. What I was hoping to learn is when you started being concerned about the damage we are doing to our environment.

I think it was when I was in college and working as a legislative aide to Senator Dawnzella James in the Georgia state legislature and I was charged with going to some of her constituent meetings. You know, constituent meetings in East Point, Georgia dealt with a lot of different things and one of them was people concerned about environmental justice issues in the community, particularly landfills and [industrial waste] dumping. This was in the late ’90s. To see communities whose issues had to do with pollution that appeared to be intentional — and polluting was prevalent not just in this particular community, but throughout the country — I think that was one of the first places that really raised my awareness of issues like this.

When I came back home [to Greenville] and started practicing law and running for office, the issue that really catapulted me into environmental work was working on water issues in my community. Understanding Greenville’s brown water [caused by cypress roots in underground springs] and how it impacts our communities [the water was safe to drink but locals said its dirty color hampered economic development and the city couldn’t afford a filtration system to clear it up] — that really grew into understanding the economic and environmental disparities that impact the communities that look like mine.

Going through that process … opened the door to additional engagement because [then EPA Administrator] Lisa Jackson visited Greenville and asked me to work with her on the local government advisory committee. I was like, Oh my God. I’m so honored. And she said, Hold your horses, you don’t know what I just asked you to do. And she was absolutely right, because within two to three weeks of that the [April 2010] BP oil spill happened.

When I look at back at my development and trajectory into environmental work, it has always been community-based. The one thing that was similar in all of these experiences was the understanding of community and how the lens of environmental work was never seen through their eyes. I found that powerful because it was, in my opinion, the most important element that had been left out.

As a former EPA administrator, how hard do you think it’s going to be for the agency to bounce back post-Trump?

That is that is definitely a concern. The fact that there are 85 regulations that this administration has in some way tried to either reverse, or put a halt to, or weaken puts the pressure on the next administration not only to meet the climate requirements of the Paris Accord, but at the same time respond to 85 rollbacks.

‘[2020] candidates that are successful will be able to wrap climate into every single topic.’

On top of all that, there’s [the EPA itself] to shore up, because this administration has really tried to devastate the agency in terms of its workforce. It has reduced the number of scientists, and it has reduced the number of staff that are necessary to do congressionally required actions. This is actually cutting scientists and institutional knowledge that we need in this agency…. I am a woman of faith, so I’m praying for some grace and mercy for the next administration, but also that there are folks who are going to be able to come in and hit the ground running at full speed, just to catch up.

Moms Clean Air Force aims at nonpartisanship, right?

Correct. We are mom-partisan.

I’m curious about whether that can be challenging at times and what steps you recommend to help build consensus across the divide?

Yes, it is challenging at times. What we find is that it helps if we can keep people focused on our children. Like, forget all of the other noise that’s going on and how we feel about it, our reality is we have to focus on what’s the best thing for our kids. We try to find those places of commonality that allow us to bring people to the table around similar issues. For example, when it came to the [Trump administration’s proposed] rollback of the [federal] mercury and air toxic standards, which we really fought hard to get, we were able to connect with the evangelical community because they were very supportive of protecting unborn children. So there was some commonality there and we could come together with people who are traditionally thought to be very conservative.

Do you think climate change is going to be a key issue in the 2020 elections?

Yes, it is — for some good reasons and some not-so-good reasons. The not-so-good reasons are there will be more extreme weather and every time there is a devastation with extreme weather that we can connect to climate, it will be front and center. It may not be front and center for long, but it will be front and center … and it will impact people in one of their five physical senses or maybe all of them, and we’ll call for some action on climate. It’s happening in California now with the fires that have taken place. In Georgia, they just put out their Level 1 drought alert. So these are things that people feel, and anything that people feel they will vote on.

The other thing is, nobody a year ago could have said that our entire country would be moved by a 16-year-old-girl sailing across the ocean to do climate strikes, right? Yet here we are [with Greta Thunberg]. And we have an entire movement of young people that are showing up in places to talk about climate. So I think that it is definitely going to be a part of the conversation that people consider when they vote.

Now, the candidates that are successful will be able to wrap climate into every single topic. So if we’re going to talk about health and wellness in this country, part of that conversation will be about climate, part of their answer will be about the health impacts of climate. Education, part of that answer is going to be about how in the next 20 years our schools and education systems will certainly do good to focus on how to solve the climate crisis and increase our ability to create solutions. When it comes to the economy, it will help to have a conversation about the renewable energy sector being one of the number one growth sectors in this country and how this is a place where people can get jobs. These are the types of ideas that I think will resonate with people. They need that connector.

You mentioned that you’re a person of faith. How important has your faith been in the work that you do, especially given that the mainstream environmental movement has been largely agnostic.

Yeah, it goes back to that idea that you can’t believe in Jesus and the climate at the same time, which is crazy to me because the actual tenets of faith have to do with taking care of God’s creation. For me, and I’m speaking very personally, not for the organization, it is my responsibility as a Christian believer to take care of what God has blessed me with. And part of that is care for the Earth.

I think that we’ve done a disservice to the environmental movement in couching our Christianity as a dominion-ism, in terms of God has given us dominion over these things as opposed to, has charged us with taking care of this. And that’s a big difference between, I think, black and white [people] in terms of our Christianity and in our beliefs with respect to climate.

Creation care has a deeper meaning [for us] because this goes back to our enslavement ... The idea of salvation was an idea of freedom, which as an enslaved person was the thing that we clung to. But also the sense of responsibility, to care for things, to care for each other better. Which is a lot different than sort of the sin and damnation and everybody going to hell [idea of Christianity]… I connect to it very deeply. My ancestors came to this continent and struggled through so much. Part of their faith — I have ministers in my family line — was a belief that we are now free through Christ, but that we have an obligation to take care of what God has given us, to take care of other people, to free other people — not through our Bible-thumping but through how we live.

What, if anything, in your opinion is missing in the mainstream environmental movement? How can it better serve its mission?

I think we’re in this really cool space where we’re changing the conversation. We’re sort of all becoming translators and learning each other’s languages. We’ve been working in our own silos until now. A lot of the larger, more majority organizations have been trying for some time [to break down silos and be inclusive of marginalized communities], but are now recognizing they’ve got to shift their language. They are recognizing that it’s not always about just magnifying a voice in some of these communities; they just really need to give people the microphone and let them speak for themselves.

We’re beginning to now see that type of partnership and it’s because we’re on a timeline. We know we’ve got 10 to 11 years, as opposed to the 12 that the IPPC report initially told us, to reduce our carbon emissions, or we’re going to be in a place where we can have irreversible changes. We can shift some of that if we figure out how to talk to each other and work together.

But it means having some give and take. So, white organizations, or majority organizations, and majority donors who have not typically engaged or worked with some of the minority communities are now having to do that and they should. It means some of the minority organizations who have sort of turned their faces and said, Y’all didn’t want to mess with us and now you want to talk to us? have to say yes, they’re willing to come in and have these conversations. So it’s a healing process. But it’s also learning how to talk to one another to solve a problem.

46,46,"Sep 12, 2018",,"In North Carolina, co-ops are building a more democratic economy","Nestled at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina, Morganton may seem like an unlikely place to find a large Mayan community. But since the 1980s, the Burke County city of almost 17,000 people, over 75 percent of them white and 12 percent black, is home to a growing Latino community, including Mayan immigrants from Guatemala.

Like other immigrants before them, the Maya came to Morganton in search of economic opportunity. Many found work at the local Case Farms chicken processing plant but grew dissatisfied over low wages, poor working conditions, and unsuccessful labor organizing efforts.

Searching for a better way to make a living, some have found it in cooperative economics. In 2008, Morganton native Molly Hemstreet organized Opportunity Threads to fill the need for ethical labor opportunities for the local community and to produce textiles for companies across North Carolina. Today, 20 of the co-op's 26 employees are Mayans.

Every employee at Opportunity Threads is hired with the expectation of becoming a worker-owner who gets to vote to determine how profits are divided, how new members are recruited, and how the cooperative invests in the local community.

That democratic approach to work drives plant manager Walter Vicente, who came to North Carolina from Guatemala in 1999 at age 14, to recruit others into the cooperative system. He hopes to eventually see the number of Opportunity Thread's employees grow to upwards of 60.

""It's what I love to do — explaining to people that there are other ways to work, to be your own boss,"" Vicente told Facing South.

'On the right side'

Opportunity Threads is one of dozens of cooperative organizations in North Carolina and elsewhere across country seeking to fill the gaps created by increasing economic inequality.

Cooperatives have a rich history in the South and played an important role during the black freedom struggle in the 1950s and ‘60s. For example, the civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer formed the Freedom Farm Cooperative in Sunflower County, Mississippi, in 1969 in an effort to empower poor black sharecroppers who had long been at the mercy of white landowners. The cooperative planted cash crops like cotton to pay administrative expenses as well as vegetables that were distributed to its members.

Last year the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund — an influential fund that has long supported agricultural co-ops across the South — celebrated its 50th anniversary. During a dinner to mark the occasion, Charles Prejean, the group's original executive director, noted that the federation ""survived because we are on the right side. We want families to succeed and have opportunity.""

Cooperatives are not limited to factories and farms: There are also cooperative grocery stores, credit unions, and more. The central principle they all have in common is a commitment to economic democracy — to worker-owned, -managed, and -governed workplaces. As a result, cooperatives have historically broken down barriers for the economically disadvantaged, often in communities of color.

African Americans have long taken part in cooperative economic activity as a way of surviving white oppression. ""We were using pooling mechanisms from the very beginning,"" political economist Jessica Gordon-Nembhard of the City University of New York and co-founder of the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives told Grassroots Economic Organizing in a 2014 interview. Those efforts eventually became formalized through churches, fraternal organizations, mutual aid societies, unions, and cooperatives.

""Most people want to work. Most people do work,"" said Gordon-Nembhard. ""With a co-op, people control what's happening to it, and what decisions get made economically; and then benefit proportionally. So we see how co-ops are a viable strategy exactly because of how they help groups of like-minded people in similar situations to collectively help themselves and each other.""

'Radically inclusive'

Not every cooperative has a focus on empowering poor communities, but those that do have a resource in the Greensboro, North Carolina-based Fund for Democratic Communities (F4DC). Founded by activists Marnie Thompson and Ed Whitfield in 2007, F4DC provides financial and technical assistance for grassroots and community-based economic development projects, including cooperatives.

For example, F4DC was an early supporter of the Renaissance Food Cooperative, which was organized in Greensboro in 2016 and now provides jobs and affordable grocery options in one of the most food insecure areas in the United States.

The Fund has also been supporting a new venture being organized in the historically African-American community of Southeast Raleigh. The Fertile Ground Food Cooperative seeks to address the lack of access to nutritious and affordable food in their community, parts of which have been deemed ""food deserts.""

The idea for Fertile Ground was conceived after the closing of two Kroger grocery stores in Southeast Raleigh. To fill the gap, Fertile Ground was designed as a multi-stakeholder cooperative business, where workers, consumers, and farmers will all share the profits. Since organizing began in 2012, the nascent cooperative has signed up over 300 members.

""It's not just a question of a grocery store,"" said Fertile Ground organizer Ajamu Dillahunt, a longtime community leader and activist, and a former board chair of the Institute for Southern Studies, publisher of Facing South. ""We're not doing it in the framework of entrepreneurs looking for business. The model is about democracy.""

While Fertile Ground has been met with enthusiasm by Southeast Raleigh residents, organizers have encountered difficulties that have delayed the co-op's public opening. In 2014, for example, leading conservative donor and Koch brothers ally Art Pope purchased one of the shuttered Krogers that Fertile Ground had been eyeing for its operations and opened a discount grocery store. Still looking for a permanent space, Fertile Ground has been hosting a farmers' market in spring and summer. They hope to have the co-op up and running by 2020.

Cooperatives like Fertile Ground and Opportunity Threads aim to serve as models for future cooperative ventures across the South and country. Communities in North Carolina and across the South have benefitted from cooperatives and their long history of economic cooperation. Bolstered by local organizations such as F4DC, cooperative leaders are working to lay the framework for future cooperative economic development in communities in need of alternatives.

""The overwhelming majority of people are not served well by the systems that we have,"" said F4DC co-founder Ed Whitfield. ""We want to be radically inclusive and make sure people that do not typically have access to financing through traditional means would have that access.""","Like other immigrants before them, the Maya came to Morganton in search of economic opportunity.

47,47,"Jul 13, 2018",The Atlantic,Reopening the Emmett Till Case Is a Cynical Play,"I was touring the museum, exiting an exhibit on the life and assassination of Evers, the former state NAACP field secretary, when I received a curious news alert. The Associated Press reported that the Department of Justice had announced it was reopening its investigation into the killing of Till, whose mutilated body was discovered by boys fishing in the Tallahatchie River in 1955. According to the news story, the DOJ announced its intentions in a report from March 2018 that’s just recently been revealed. The move was reportedly sparked by a revelation in The Blood of Emmett Till, a 2017 book by historian Timothy B. Tyson, that the accusation that had allegedly prompted Till’s lynching was false. Specifically, Carolyn Bryant Donham admitted to Tyson that her claim, which she made to her then-husband Roy Bryant and his brother J.W. Milam, that Till had sexually harassed her was a lie.

It’s unclear just what could possibly come out of the case’s reopening. Bryant and Milam are dead, and they were acquitted by a kangaroo court, after the defense told an all-white jury “that every last Anglo-Saxon one of you has the courage to free these men.” Donham turns 84 this month, and, as detailed in a forthcoming book, Let the People See: The Story of Emmett Till by Loyola University Chicago historian Elliott Gorn, she was already tried as an accessory to the lynching.* “District Attorney Chiles decided to bring one case to the Leflore County grand jury, against Carolyn Bryant as an accomplice to her husband and brother-in-law,” Gorn writes. “The jurors refused to endorse a true bill, the evidence was just too thin. Too many people were dead, too many memories cloudy, too few witnesses willing to cooperate. None of the nineteen jurors—twelve women and seven men, divided about evenly along racial lines—voted to indict.”

We already have a good sense of how Bryant and Milam killed Till, as they were brazen enough to admit to the crime in a 1956 interview with Look Magazine. If that weren’t enough, in a previous phase of the investigation the DOJ unearthed a recording of Bryant telling an informant that he’d “put [Till’s] ass in the Tallahatchie River.” The investigation’s earlier iteration, which was closed in 2007, came up zeroes, since Bryant and Milam had died by then. “In the end, the Federal agents simply reported their findings and made no recommendations regarding prosecutions,” Gorn writes.

A reader responds: The Long-Delayed Pursuit of Justice

Till’s kin, burdened most by the blatant miscarriage of justice in the case, understandably seem to seek some measure of closure, and look to this announcement with hope. “We want the process to work, and we want justice to prevail for Emmett,” Till’s cousin Deborah Watts told USA Today. Donham’s confession has likely made that drive for closure even more maddening. The terror of the Bryant clan didn’t die with the child or with the men, and the laughing and winking admissions have been taunts. Lynchings are about power, and timeless impunity is that power’s ultimate expression.","According to the news story, the DOJ announced its intentions in a report from March 2018 that’s just recently been revealed.

49,49,"Jan 28, 2020",Center for Public Integrity,Gulf shrimpers fight for their livelihoods in a fertilizer-fueled dead zone – Center for Public Integrity,"About this series

This story is part of a series by the Center for Public Integrity, Grist and The World about how our overuse of fertilizer harms the climate and endangers the public.

In 2010, Blanchard graduated to political battles with BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, a spill that sent 4.9 million barrels of oil into his fishing ground. Dean Blanchard Seafood took a hit, and Blanchard later told a reporter that he estimated his business was worth 15 percent of what it was before the spill. He testified in Congress and appeared on national news shows to lobby for his industry.

Increasingly, Blanchard and other Gulf Coast fishermen find themselves reckoning with a different type of pollution, a threat to ocean biodiversity and Louisiana’s $2 billion seafood industry that’s unrelated to oil and much harder to fix.

“Sometimes we’ll get thousands of pounds of shrimp a day, then the next day everything’s gone,” Blanchard said. “When the dead zone comes, it just kills everything.”

The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is a massive, oxygen-deprived swath of water concentrated off the coast of Louisiana and Texas, fed by polluted freshwater from states along the Mississippi River.

The Mississippi is born in Minnesota, its cold water bubbling over football sized rocks that edge the glacial Lake Itasca. From there it begins a walking-paced meander, 2,320 miles toward New Orleans. Like a topological funnel between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi drains 40 percent of the contiguous United States, carrying left-over nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer spread on farmland across the Midwest toward the Delta. The chemicals encourage the growth of algae, which suck up oxygen and choke marine life.

Politicians and environmental scientists from the states responsible for allowing the most fertilizer runoff into the Mississippi — Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana — are encouraging farmers to plant cover crops, change how they rotate crops and take other measures to prevent polluted river water from barreling toward the Gulf and creating a zone of hypoxia (low oxygen) in one of the country’s most fertile fishing grounds. But these scattered efforts have yet to yield much success.

Small family farms, local conservation groups and university scientists constitute the driving force of progress, leaving America’s large-scale corporate farmers silent in the background. There is no national prediction from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, its Hypoxia Task Force, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicating the total fertilizer load needed to shrink the dead zone. The problem is too complex for straightforward answers: Its outcome relies on rainfall, ocean temperature, soil health and crop growth rates.

Last year, the dead zone measured as much as 6,952 square miles, larger than Connecticut and much bigger than the 5-year average of 5,770 square miles, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Studies in the journal Science state that the global area of dead zones have quadrupled in the last 50 years, driven by a growing human population and an increase in the need for corn, soybeans, biofuels and livestock feed.

Few places have felt the consequences harder than Louisiana, the country’s second-largest source of seafood after Alaska. NOAA estimates the dead zone costs the state’s seafood and tourism industries $82 million a year. It has made the work of fishing in the Gulf even more difficult. The dead zone grows in the summer after spring rains from the Midwest wash pollutants south, forcing ocean life to flee to areas where they wouldn’t normally be found. They would normally move from inshore nurseries to offshore spawning grounds, but the lack of oxygen blocks their migration.

So trawlers have been winding up with more small shrimp and fewer of the plump ones customers favor. That decreased volume comes even with improved equipment — new evolutions in radar, winches and net technology. “So far we have 68,000 pounds a day for the month,” Blanchard said in July, usually a peak month. “Normally we average about 90,000 pounds a day.”

The changing climate plays a role, too, with increased and more intense rainfall that speeds up erosion on farmland. In May, the output of the Mississippi River and its distributary, the Atchafalaya River, was 67 percent above the long-term average between 1980 and 2018, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This discharge carried 156,000 metric tons of nitrate (the weight of more than 750 Statues of Liberty) and 25,300 metric tons of phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico last May — 18 percent and 49 percent above long-term averages, respectively.

The obvious solution is to stanch the pollution at its source upstream. But if efforts to trap runoff from farms don’t succeed, wetland restoration projects in the Delta could form a defense of last resort by redirecting the Mississippi’s polluted flow into marshland where contaminants can be absorbed before they hit the ocean.

Seth Blitch, coastal and marine conservation director at Louisiana’s outpost of The Nature Conservancy, sat at his desk in Baton Rouge last June, below a wall-to-wall satellite image of the Mississippi Delta. Like an upside-down tree its printed lines fan out into the ocean.

Two stories below, the real-life Mississippi River slid past behind a levee. The river had breached its western bank, drowning shoreside factories and chemical plants beneath brown water full of earth, fertilizer and vegetation from the north.

After the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927 — which submerged 27,000 square miles of land along the river, killing hundreds of people — the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to raise its banks under the Flood Control Act passed the following year. Today, the Mississippi River levee system is 2,203 miles long, incorporating tributary flood walls and control stations. This mitigates flooding, but it gave birth to a new set of problems.

Before the 20th century building spree, a rush of floodwater would have spilled into wetlands, mangroves and swamps where pollutants would be filtered out by vegetation, before the water seeped toward the sea. But now the levee system funnels water flow, pollutants and sediment straight to the Gulf of Mexico. Hundreds of miles of navigation channels, pipelines and exploratory canals built by the oil and gas industry compound the problem. Dredged soil from much of that construction was piled on the edges of waterways, forming piles known as spoil banks, or spoil levees, which impede the natural flow of water. “The process of wetland renourishment by fresh water and sediment in Louisiana is severed by levees,” Blitch said.

The Atchafalaya River Basin comprises about a million acres of wetlands, covering roughly the area of Rhode Island. It typically takes a third of the Mississippi’s water. The Atchafalaya Swamp acts as a filtration system, with plants feeding on nitrogen and phosphorus and slowing the flow of water travelling south.

In 2015, The Nature Conservancy bought nearly 5,400 acres of forest there, a preservation restoration project called the Atchafalaya River Basin Initiative. Once it gets approved by state regulators, the plan is to lower spoil banks to allow nutrient-filled water back into the marshes. “The idea is to restore the flow of water and sediment such that it both floods and drains from the property more like it would have before constructed levees and spoiling altered the flow,” Blitch said. He hopes that the project might one day form a restoration framework for states throughout the Mississippi River Basin.

David Chauvin’s Seafood Company teeters on the silty marshland between the mouths of the Atchafalaya and the Mississippi Rivers in Dulac, Louisiana. On a Monday in June, teeming rain battered the tin roofs above Chauvin’s workers as they readied shrimp storage equipment, racing to unload boats escaping the storm. The rain bounced off concrete slick with diesel and fish oil. And a Bobcat mini-digger ferried bucketloads of ice between the freezer and shrimp storage bins, pushing its way through insulation curtains, orange headlights cutting through mist.

Chauvin’s wife, Kim, was frantic — one of their four shrimp trawlers was caught on a sand bar on Grand Isle, near Dean Blanchard’s place, 70 miles east. Switching from cell phone to cell phone, she tried to compile information and mount a rescue plan for a worst-case scenario.

“On the one hand we have tropical depressions, on the other we have this humongous dead zone,” she said. “We’re between a rock and a hard place.”

Kim Chauvin has met with farming groups keen to help clean up the Gulf Coast. She found that local and family-owned farmers were sympathetic to the plight of shrimpers and recognized their role in the chain of pollution. “I don’t blame the mom and pops,” she said. “It’s usually big corporations who think they don’t have to change.”

Big or small, farmers are largely free to do what they want, because federal regulations don’t require them to curb fertilizer runoff. Oversight mostly falls to state agencies that are often keen on voluntary efforts in place of enforcing rules. Kim Chauvin would like to see strict federal limits on agricultural pollution entering the Mississippi, backed by fines for non-compliance and reparations for historical damage to Louisiana’s shrimping industry.

Federal agencies have launched efforts to attack the problem. The USDA has granted millions of dollars to agricultural and conservation groups for the development of nutrient reduction strategies. And in 1997, the EPA organized what is now called the Hypoxia Task Force, which later pledged to shrink the dead zone by three quarters before 2015.

But at the end of 2014, with no progress in sight, the task force extended its deadline to 2035, with a new pledge to hit a 20-percent reduction by 2025. There’s no evidence of success yet.

Small family farms, local conservationists, universities and some local governments have been experimenting with methods to curtail fertilizer runoff. State officials, including Brad Redlin, a manager for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture’s water-quality program, are trying to nudge farmers into better practices with incentives. They’ve started initiatives in which farmers and local governments split the costs of creating wetland filtration systems and supported new markets for harvested cover crops so that farmers can recoup some of the cost of planting.

“There’s been little to no taste for regulating agriculture,” Redlin said. “But there’s a level of reassurance that conservation systems do exist out there in the countryside.”

In 2012, Redlin designed a voluntary certification program for farmers in Minnesota, in partnership with the USDA and EPA, that established standards for agricultural water quality. When farmers sign up, the state studies their farms using software that highlights bad practices. Redlin’s program suggests alternative methods to farmers to run their operations cleaner and more efficiently — the reduction of overall fertilizer use, the planting of cover crops and limiting soil tilling, which leads to erosion.

In 2016, his network of 15 state certifiers began walking across Minnesota’s farmland, field by field, to begin assessments. The process appeals to farmers who want an assessment of the health of their whole farm. If the farm is not up to par, the farmer might have to plant cover crops or build buffers designed to interrupt the flow of runoff. Redlin now has 731 producers certified over a total area of 489,385 acres.

“It’s often expressed that 70 percent of the problem is coming from 20 percent of the people; that’s not invalid,” Redlin said. “But it seems to be a different cliché, like death by a thousand cuts. Every farm is a little bit leaky and the cumulative result is a dead zone in the Gulf.”

Mike Naig, Iowa’s secretary of agriculture, smoothed his navy-blue suit jacket as he sat at a polished wood conference table preparing to co-chair the 2019 meeting of the Hypoxia Task Force in Baton Rouge. Naig comes from a long line of farmers and still travels back to his parent’s farm in northern Iowa to help work the land.

“We all understand that we feed into the Gulf,” he said. “And shame on us if we don’t take advantage of the opportunity to show that we can be effective.”

Naig works as an intermediary between farmers, the USDA, the EPA and Congress, drumming up support for agricultural conservation projects through funding, policy changes and permitting. He helps public and private interests collaborate — farmers, fertilizer sellers, environmental scientists and governments — lining up access to equipment, technical assistance and financial aid for nutrient-reduction projects. Naig has 14 watershed demonstration projects across the state, which show how cover crops, bioreactors and wetlands can reduce nutrient runoff on working farm land on a small scale.

According to Naig’s department, his efforts have led to 1 million acres of cover crops planted and 88 completed wetlands, with another 30 under development across Iowa.

Naig thinks federal regulations to curtail runoff would backfire. If it was a regulatory obligation, he argued, the dynamic between farmers and government would breed bitterness. Top-down structures for conservation, enforced federally, he said, would mean flip-flopping on industrial and environmental goals every time a new president landed in the White House.

“We want people to use their own innovative approaches,” Naig said. “I think we’ll get to a better place, and we’ll get there faster, through unleashing people’s creativity.”

Iowa’s 2013 Nutrient Reduction Strategy, a state government initiative to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, promised a 45 percent decrease in fertilizer runoff by 2035, but despite Naig’s efforts there’s been no change yet. Experts say large-scale crop producers have yet to make adaptations to their methods of growing.

Dean Blanchard has been in business for 37 years, distributing shrimp off the barrier island of Grand Isle in the Mississippi River Delta. “When the dead zone comes,” he said, “it just kills everything.” (Spike Johnson for Grist)

For shrimpers living along the Delta like Dean Blanchard and Kim Chauvin, patience is wearing thin. “On a congressional level we need to say enough is enough,” she said. “We need to list annual goals for change and stick to the plan.”

She said that shrimpers want face-to-face meetings with large-scale commercial farmers and fertilizer companies. They want to show the consequences of current methods of farming on those who live and fish on the coasts. They want fines and regulation for offending agricultural operations and a return to healthier waters.

“We need them to understand what they’re doing to the fishing industry,” Chauvin said. “The states above us should be paying something to the industry that they’re destroying.”

50,50,"Sep 10, 2018",Vanity Fair,Inside One Police Chief’s Hunt for Justice in a Pair of Unsolved Mississippi Murders,"Lord, I’m going to Rosedale. —Robert Johnson, “Traveling Riverside Blues.”

As Highway 1 follows the great river through the Mississippi Delta, it pauses in Rosedale. For 10 blocks, from one end of town to the other, the highway becomes Main Street. Buildings along the route stand abandoned, roofless and derelict. Settlers originally came to Rosedale to sow cotton in its muddy soil. Since then, this Mississippi community of 1,685 (more than 90 percent of which is African-American) has distinguished itself for two reasons besides the fertile earth: its many churches and its chronic lawlessness.

On a sunny Sunday, while on assignment for a travel magazine, I join the congregation at Rosedale’s Riverside United Baptist Church. A drummer pounds out stomping rhythms as the gospel choir wails. Men wear crisp, natty suits. Women dance in white lace dresses and peach-colored gowns. As church lets out, a man walks over and introduces himself as Anthony Gibson, the chief of police in Beulah, the next town over. Having overheard that I am a journalist, he says he has a story for me. Lately, he explains, he has been looking into some cold-case homicides in which two victims, in separate incidents, had been killed with the branch of a pecan tree. One key suspect is a man who will soon be released from prison. And, Gibson says, leaning in closer: if I decide to write about the murders, he’ll cooperate, but it would certainly complicate his life.

“Why?” I ask. “Aren’t you a police chief?”

“It doesn’t matter,” he answers, looking over his shoulder. “This is the dirty South, man. Real dirty.”

Gibson breaks down the facts for me. The man he considers to be a murder suspect is named Ronnie Estes. Ronnie’s brother Carey, known as Dinky, is Rosedale’s mayor. (Dinky had Gibson fired from Rosedale’s police force 13 years ago, while Gibson was investigating the homicides.) A third Estes brother, Billy Joe, served for decades as the chief investigator and deputy sheriff overseeing Rosedale—the man largely responsible for deciding which crimes in Bolivar County would be pursued in court. Primarily due to Gibson’s efforts, Ronnie Estes was convicted in 2003—not for murder, but for sexual battery of a six-year-old girl. He got 15 years and five years’ probation. And he is scheduled for release in October. The murders remain unsolved.

I agree to meet Gibson the next morning at his office in Beulah, 10 minutes away, down Highway 1.

Highways in the Delta are long and straight. In summertime, the play of molten air on sizzling asphalt creates mirages so that the blue horizon seems to merge with the very road. Things here, at times, are more ominous than they appear. In certain graveyards, the lids of the burial vaults sit so close to the ground that the interred are actually resting near the topsoil. The waterways also hold their own dark secrets. In 1955, for example, the white men who brutally murdered a black teenager named Emmett Till drove to Rosedale the night they tied a metal cotton-gin fan around his neck and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River. He was found three days later when his feet floated up to the surface. The alleged killers—who spoke of Rosedale’s riverside as “the scariest place in the Delta”—were never imprisoned, though everyone knew they did it. The Department of Justice finally re-opened the Till case this year. But for generations, black lives have not mattered in Mississippi courts.

The scene of Patricia Horsley’s slaying, in 1994 Photograph by William Hereford.

As I drive out to Beulah, population 325, I pass rusted trailer homes and boarded-up structures. An African-American prisoner labors on the train tracks; a white officer watches over him. The two men, in a way, embody Beulah: founded in 1855 by Frank A. Montgomery, who would become a Civil War lieutenant colonel. After his slaves were freed, Montgomery started the county’s first chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. He later became a respected circuit-court judge.

Gibson—aged 47, barrel-chested, athletic, with a thin mustache—meets me at Beulah’s tiny town hall, wearing a bulletproof vest and black pants with yellow piping. He ushers me into a back room and starts telling me the story of the pecan-branch murders.

One foggy January evening in 1994, Gibson was chatting with a friend in front of Rosedale’s central hangout, the Double Quick, a convenience store, gas station, and lunch counter where Gibson last saw his former high-school classmate Patrice Horsley. Both of them were 22.

People around town said that Horsley had been having drug issues, so Gibson, a juvenile-detention officer at the time, wasn’t entirely surprised to see her arrive with Ronnie Estes. When Horsley walked over to greet Gibson, he could immediately tell that she was on crack. “You need to get off this stuff,” he told her, gently. “Girl, this is not you.” He also warned her, he says, about the company she was keeping. Estes, 28, had already been in trouble with the law. “You may not realize who you’re hangin’ with,” Gibson cautioned. “Boy, I know,” she answered, “but we’re just gonna ride around and drink a bit.” Patrice and Ronnie loaded a 48-pack of beer onto the back of a pickup. They pulled out of the parking lot, and Gibson watched their taillights head north on Highway 1.

Word soon came back that Patrice Horsley had been found dead, disfigured, and left in a field beside a graveyard. “This wasn’t a regular homicide,” Gibson tells me. Horsley’s skull was caved in. An autopsy found massive craniocerebral trauma, brain hemorrhaging, and multiple fractures to her facial bones. Her body was covered in slashes, some evidently the result of her trying to escape by running into the cemetery’s barbed-wire fence. Her body lay in a field nearby, pants around her ankles. According to several sources, the branch of a pecan tree had been forced into her.","—Robert Johnson, “Traveling Riverside Blues.”As Highway 1 follows the great river through the Mississippi Delta, it pauses in Rosedale.

The six-movement jazz suite is performed for one night only at Jazz at Lincoln Center's The Appel Room January 26.

Visionary composer, trumpeter, and multi-instrumentalist Wadada Leo Smith brings his multimedia presentation of America’s National Parks to The Appel Room for one night only on January 26. Prepare for a breathtaking, epic, six-movement suite inspired by “the scenic splendor, historic legacy, and political controversies of the country’s public landscapes.”

Wadada Leo Smith was born in Leland, Mississippi, in the heart of the fertile grounds of the blues. This planted the seed in Wadada’s musical foundation. He started playing in marching bands and high school concerts, and by age 13 he was involved in Delta blues and other music traditions. “Watching the sun come up from the ground and go back into the ground, because where I lived it was flatland...,” he says. “The flatland teaches man such beautiful things about rising and falling. The crops growing up and becoming produce and the crops depleting themselves and being chopped and thrown back into the ground.”

Wadada’s stepfather, Alex “Little Bill” Wallace, a composer, guitarist, and one of the pioneers of electric guitar in Delta blues, gave Wadada his formal music education. In his university studies, Wadada researched a variety of music cultures: African, Japanese, Indonesian, European, and American.

Some of the artists Wadada has performed with are Anthony Braxton, Leroy Jenkins, Roscoe Mitchell, Henry Threadgill, Lester Bowie, Joseph Jarman, Cecil Taylor, Steve McCall, Anthony Davis, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Jeanne Lee, Tadao Sawai, Muhal Richard Abrams, Ed Blackwell, Kazuko Shiraishi, Han Bennink, Marion Brown, Charlie Haden, Malachi Favors Magoustous, Jack DeJohnette, Vijay Iyer, Ikue Mori, Min Xiao Fen, Bill Laswell, John Zorn, Ronald Shannon Jackson, and Frank Lowe.

America’s National Parks was released in 2016 and was voted Album of the Year by DownBeat magazine, and Wadada won as Artist of the Year and Trumpeter of the Year. The suite was also listed in the top-ten albums of the year by the New York Times and NPR. In 2017 Wadada was honored by the Jazz Journalists Association as their Musician of the Year.

As with America’s National Parks, he explains, “I do quite a lot of reflection and meditation on these projects. In this instance, it was December 2015 when my video artist Jesse Gilbert sent me Ken Burns’ documentary on the national parks. About 15 minutes into watching it, I knew immediately what my next project was going to be. I grabbed my pen and started to write about the first national park…and that was Yellowstone. It was written completely without change and orchestrated completely without change. Ken Burns said that the national parks were cathedrals. My intention was to show something different, that they were common grounds held for the community of people on the planet…not just the Americans. They represented the past—those who have passed on to the hereafter; the present; and the future—those who are coming afterward.”

For this evening’s performance, Wadada brings his quintet of Anthony Davis (piano), Ashley Walters (cello), John Lindberg (bass), Pheeroan akLaff (drums), and Jesse Gilbert (video artist). “I use a video component to bring the music and the people inside those images of the past and intermingle it together with the present. My feeling is that the parks should be independent from Congress and organized around an independent source who has no political need to be reelected. So it’s a spiritual/psychological investigation mixed with the political dynamics.”

From his early days in the Mississippi Delta to the New York City view of The Appel Room, Wadada has had a long and rewarding journey. “I just know that I’ve been blessed. I don’t have to crawl and beg to get music out of the pen, it comes through me very fast. That’s because of the will of God, not me. I’m 76 years old, and I play longer and stronger than I played when I was 22. Anything that has happened to me in life, I see it all as being from grace, from the Almighty.

For this spectacular one-night-only multimedia journey, Wadada brings his spirituality to the stage. “Music goes from heart to heart. It knits all the hearts together in one space in one self. Music causes a person to have reflection or meditation or even contemplation. Through God, human beings are made better. Music itself is the way this energy force flies. It’s not in the melody, it’s not in the harmony, it’s not in the rhythm, it’s not in the song—it’s in what goes along with the breath of life.”

“I’m hoping that the people [at the performance] experience great music, and that with that great music they may be transformed, and that that transformation will allow them moments with themselves to figure out what the next step is and how to take that next step.”

53,53,"Jul 7, 2019",Natchez Democrat,"Big, beautiful sunflowers brighten area summer gardens - Mississippi's Best Community Newspaper","I have seen some beautiful sunflowers this summer. Big and small, short and tall. There are over 60 varieties of sunflowers. They are native to the Americas and were exported around 1500. The common sunflower is Helianthus annuus.

USDA figures for 2014 show that there were 1.7 million acres of sunflowers planted in the United States that year with the most in North Dakota. The most common uses for sunflowers and their seeds are sunflower oil, wild bird food and livestock forage. They also act as a natural decontaminator of soil. They remove toxins such as lead, arsenic and uranium. They have been used at environmental disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima.

Many people think it is a myth that sunflowers turn to face the sun throughout the day. The fact is that this only occurs at the bud stage. The process is called heliotropism. Once the flower is in full bloom it no longer turns.

I have seen many claims regarding the record for the tallest and largest sunflower. According to the National Sunflower Association, the record for the tallest is 25 feet, 5.4 inches. The largest sunflower head is 32 inches. Both records are sourced to the 2004 Guinness World Records.

Sunflowers are easy to grow. They like fertile soil and adequate moisture but otherwise adapt to most growing conditions. They like space, the further apart you plant them the larger the stem and flower will be. They are best started in the ground rather than in seed trays. This is because they make a central tap root that likes to grow straight down and they grow better when undisturbed. Plant a few weeks beyond the average last frost date in the spring. You can continue to plant throughout the summer up to 75 days before the average first frost date. A good source for information and seeds is sunflowerselections.com.

I hope everyone enjoyed the crape myrtle festival. Remove faded flowers now to encourage a second blooming.

The Natchez Downtown Farmer’s Market is open from 8:00 a.m.-noon on Saturdays on the 100 block of South Commerce. There are fresh goods including peaches, carrots, blueberries, microgreens, eggs, lettuce, mushrooms and more. There are also baked goods and arts and crafts from local vendors.

Donors can contribute to the cause while honoring family members, classmates, teachers, civic clubs, churches or Sunday School classes. Brass plates will designate honorees on each seat. A chair can be selected and named with a $1,000 donation.

“Kosciusko has been fertile ground for musicians through the years. The legendary band program has launched 100s of musicians into lifetime careers in music and has instilled into countless other students the attributes of hard work, perfection, precision, and high achievement. Universities, colleges, high schools, and church music programs across the South are populated by both former Kosciusko directors and students,” said Dr. Tim Alford of the KFEE. “Many former students, regardless of their career paths, have sited the former Kosciusko Band directors as formative in their life success.”

To promote the fundraising efforts, biographies of directors and drum majors from Kosciusko’s band program will be highlighted regularly in local media, as shown below. You can look for these tributes regularly in The Star-Herald.

The $4 million price tag for the project includes $270,000 the district spent to remove asbestos, repair the roof, and repaint the interior. District maintenance personnel have also worked on the carpets, seats and lighting.

While the district’s Phase I project will get the doors open for the, the KFEE project aims to turn the auditorium into an area showpiece, able to host events and shows for the larger regional community.

The group suggested naming the upgraded auditorium the Skipworth Performing Arts Center, after the man Alford said is an historic local figure with strong connections to the local arts scene. It was Skipworth who started a local band in the 1930s, begging for instruments during the depression. By 1934, the band was winning prizes.

“He established the tradition of excellence in that band and in our community,” Alford said, adding that Skipworth even went to the Tipton Street School to encourage students there to take up playing musical instruments. “He had a profound influence on people’s lives here. This would be a tribute and conveys a community idea and not just one about the school district.”

If completed as planned, the upgraded facility would likely see an enlarged lobby area for larger groups to convene by extending the building out into the current parking area a bit. The number of seats would likely be reduced slightly to accommodate more leg room and wider aisles. The current orchestra pit could be temporarily or permanently covered to allow for the stage front to be moved closer to the audience.

The 2021 class looks to have some solid headliners, but the lack of depth in the talent pool has proven to be a real challenge. There are likely still some hidden gems that remain unearthed due to a lack of in-person evaluation time this year. That is certainly a factor, but three months before the December signing period, the Magnolia state cupboard is a little more bare than normal.

While college coaches are hunting high and low to fill their needs in the 2021, there are several junior standouts already announcing their arrivals. With several in-staters already holding SEC tenders, the class of 2022 looks to be a return to form for the state of Mississippi.

Holmes County Central corner Khamauri Rogers is currently ranked as the top player in the state. Rogers committed to LSU early on and has maintained a sense of loyalty to the defending national champs. Despite that early pledge, Mississippi State and others remain in pursuit. The Tigers will have their work cut out for themselves.

Columbia High School has a pair of rising stars in defensive tackle Jaheim Oatis and running back Omar Johnson. Oatis has camped at Mississippi State and has been in touch with the Bulldogs despite a coaching change at the turn of the year. Oatis holds offers from over half of the SEC and is expected to be one of the most highly recruited players in the southeast. Oatis' teammate, Johnson, recently picked up an offer from Mississippi State. Johnson ran for 1,221 yards and 12 touchdowns as the Wildcats #2 back in 2019.

Sophomore quarterback Micale Cunningham threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns, rushed for 81 yards on 16 carries and the Cardinals racked up a whopping 511 total yards to finish off an 8-5 season in Scott Satterfield's first year at the helm. Freshman running back Javian Hawkins was the workhorse for the Cardinals, rushing for 105 yards and one touchdown on 23 carries. Sophomore Chatarius Atwell provided balance through the air with nine receptions for 147 yards.

The Louisville defense -- which entered the game next-to-last in the ACC in rushing defense -- held the stout Bulldogs rushing attack to just 145 yards after star Kylin Hill was knocked out of the game with an injury.

It was the culmination of a remarkable turnaround for Satterfield, who took over a broken program following a 2-10 season under former coach Bobby Petrino. In one short season, Louisville transformed itself from the punchline of a very bad ACC joke into a program that looks more like the one that was a threat to Clemson and Florida State in the ACC Atlantic when Petrino had things cooking with quarterback Lamar Jackson.

The college football world is begging another team in the ACC to become a threat to knock Clemson off of its pedestal. Why not Louisville? The Cardinals are the second team in conference history to go from 0-8 in conference play to 5-3, and Satterfield just orchestrated the biggest turnaround in Power Five football in 2019. The school has made a major investment in the football program since joining the ACC earlier this decade, is in a fertile recruiting ground and has momentum on its side.

Without cotton, Memphis as we know it wouldn't exist.

The industry was fueled by the fertile soil in the Mississippi Delta, technological advancement that brought the cotton gin, slaves, later replaced by sharecroppers and others working for free or cheap, and a global demand for the crop.

Buy Photo Memphis Bicentennial (Photo: The Commercial Appeal)

Although cotton was bought and sold in Memphis for most of the half-century before the Civil War, it wasn't until after the decade after the war that a group of growers, buyers, financiers and others whose livelihoods were tied to the crop formed the Memphis Cotton Exchange in 1873.

The first location of the Cotton Exchange was in a modest building near Madison Avenue and Second Street. It then moved to a larger building near the same intersection. The final stop was the 12-story building at 65 Union Ave., where it moved in the mid-1920s and remained until it closed in 1978.

If the story of Memphis had to be told through a single building, that one at the corner of Union Avenue and Front Street — the center of what was then known as Cotton Row — is among the few that could tell it.

BLUFF CITY BICENTENNIAL: From comic to tragic, here are 200 pieces of Memphis' history

In 2006, the first floor became home to the Cotton Museum, which looks back on how cotton influenced everything in Memphis from the economy to the music to large cultural events.

""This floor sat empty from 1978 to 2006,"" said Ann Bateman, Cotton Museum manager. ""They basically walked out and locked the door. All the stuff was still here. I wouldn’t call it preserved. It was just left. ... They just literally walked out and shut the door and turned the lights out.""

Bales of cotton and pints of bourbon

Much like the name Wall Street refers to the home of the New York Stock Exchange and the financial industry ecosystem surrounding it, Cotton Row, the strip of Front Street in Downtown Memphis between Monroe and Gayoso avenues, was known simply as ""the street"" to cotton traders.

The street, including 28 buildings and two vacant lots, is now on the National Register of Historic Places. According to the National Register nomination form submitted the year before the exchange closed, the cotton trade got its formal start within the first decade of Memphis' founding.

""From 1826, when 300 bales were brought to Memphis by wagon, to the present, cotton has been important to Memphis,"" the application said, adding that by the late 1880s and 1890s, that number skyrocketed to 400,000 to 700,000 bales of cotton every year.

Much of that cotton was bought and sold along Cotton Row.

In the heart of it all was the Memphis Cotton Exchange. And on the ground level where the museum now sits was ""the floor,"" said Calvin Turley, who started his career inside the building when it was still functioning as the exchange and still runs his cotton company from the fourth floor.

On the floor, cotton merchants would gather to agree on the value of bales of compressed cotton that sat about 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide.

""For most of the history of cotton merchandising in this country, the value of a 500-pound bale of cotton was determined by a sample — approximately shoe box size, let's say — which you would look at and read like you would a book,"" Turley said.

The color of the cotton, the leaf content, and the length of the fibers when bunches were pulled apart all contributed to its value.

""You needed to be where the brokers and merchants were so you could go look at samples and determine the value of this commodity that your intention was to trade,"" he said. ""There was every good reason to have a place where people would meet one another.""

That need to be close created a cotton ecosystem.

Inside the Cotton Exchange building, cotton classers were on the top floor where the natural light was best. It was their job to examine cotton samples and sort them into different classes based on quality. The ""squidge"" worked alongside the classer as an apprentice learning the business. Until bright light bulbs were developed to mimic sunlight, this work could be done only on clear, sunny days and near windows.

Porters — usually black — maintained the street, moved cotton bales and performed other labor-intensive jobs.

Outside the building, cotton factors, who lent money to farmers to buy seed and merchants to buy cotton, set up alongside cotton insurers, warehouse representatives, steamship agents and others.

""It was to be a place where rules were made, people could gather, markets were shown on the board,"" Turley said. ""It was all about the buying and selling of cotton.""

Just as that proximity facilitated business, it also created a social order maintained by lively games of dominoes, practical jokes and often-raucous drinking.

""There was a lot of drinking on the street, which was maybe a combination of a certain level of anxiety produced by speculation during the season and then nothing to do in the summertime,"" Turley said. ""One of my first jobs was going to the Cotton Bowl liquor store and buying half pints of Old Yellowstone bourbon, which was not a very respectable brand, but it kept fires going.""

The death and rebirth of Downtown

The buildings on Cotton Row didn't match the elaborate architecture of some of the others that were rising around it, but even that was a sign of the time.

""Although built during a period of exuberant architectural expression, the Cotton Row buildings are primarily a product of function rather than prevailing fashion,"" the National Register nomination form said.

These buildings were there to get business done, not to look pretty. But just as the technology of the cotton gin helped to make the cotton industry viable, technology eventually made Cotton Row and the exchange obsolete.

While some of the world's leading cotton companies — including Dunavant Enterprises and Hohenberg Cotton, which later sold to Cargill — came from the shops on Cotton Row, as technology developed, traders could make deals over the phone from miles away and had no reason to come to Cotton Row.

As businesses disappeared and consolidated on Cotton Row, others in Downtown were shutting down too, although for different reasons.

According to Charles Crawford, a historian with the University of Memphis, as cars became more common, more and more people were willing to commute for work. As they moved east to the Memphis suburbs, businesses followed and East Memphis became the new central business district.

Opposition to school integration and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lorraine Motel only accelerated the already declining Downtown.

By the time the Memphis Cotton Exchange closed in 1978, much of Downtown was already desolate.

""You could have fired a gun down Main Street and wouldn't hit anyone,"" Crawford said.

But just as the exchange building followed the trend of a waning Downtown, it helped lead the revival.

Buy Photo The Cotton Exchange moved here to the corner of Union Avenue and Front Street in the 1920s to be even closer to the riverfront. It closed in 1978. (Photo: Brad Vest/The Commercial Appeal)

Henry Turley, who helped pioneer a wave of Downtown development and revitalization, bought the building in the mid-1980s with partner Clyde Patton. Henry Turley, Calvin Turley's brother, had already renovated two vacant buildings when he and Patton set their sights on this one.

""The building was nearly empty,"" Henry Turley said. ""There was nothing on Main Street. This place was pitiful.""

Henry Turley persuaded tenants to move in by offering part ownership of the building rather than just rental space.

After this building, Henry Turley went on to lead a new wave of residential development to encourage more density Downtown, an effort that is still underway decades later.

As for the exchange building, it is still being used for what it was always used for — offices. Now, it houses advertisers, lawyers, real estate developers and, yes, even cotton traders.

Today is a day for black joy to abound as we remember that fateful day, June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, with liberating news: The civil war has ended, and all enslaved bodies were now free! Even though the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln two years earlier on January 1, 1863, it had very little impact in Texas until General Robert Lee surrendered in April of 1865 and General Granger’s regime was powerful enough to overcome the resistance in the South.

Just the thought of the many tears and hugs and dances and praises to the high heavens that were exclaimed by countless black bodies 155 years ago, brings warmth to my face and joy to my tired soul.

60,60,"Mar 4, 2020",Washington Post,A wild Super Tuesday boosts Biden and brings new challenges for Sanders,"There are few commodities more valuable in political campaigns than momentum, and, right now, Biden is blessed with it in abundance for the first time in his campaign. Biden had a noticeable deficit in money and organization in the Super Tuesday states, compared with the well-resourced and well-organized Sanders.

AD

AD

2020 Democratic presidential candidates reacted as election results came in on Super Tuesday, when 1,357 delegates were up for grabs. (The Washington Post)

The rapid consolidation around Biden’s candidacy has given him what Sanders’s money and ground game could not produce, and the results Tuesday put the former vice president in position to compete on at least an even basis with the senator from Vermont for supremacy in the contest to become the party’s nominee.

For the foreseeable future, the calendar will not get easier for Sanders. In coming weeks, the states holding contests, with some exceptions, were ones that he lost to Hillary Clinton four years ago. In some of the states he won in 2016, the shift from caucuses to primaries could hold down his delegate totals even if he were to win again.

The prospect of Sanders emerging with a sizable lead in delegates after Tuesday’s voting, something that had sparked fears among establishment Democrats that he could be on an unstoppable march to the nomination, began to melt away as the returns came in Tuesday night, with a growing possibility that Biden would be more than competitive by the time all votes were counted.

AD

AD

Results from California, Super Tuesday’s biggest prize with 415 delegates, were coming in slowly early Wednesday morning, with Sanders leading and Bloomberg and Biden trailing. That state, more than any other, was considered the key to Sanders’s hopes of expanding his delegate total.

Texas, where 228 delegates were at stake, was a state Sanders hoped to win, thanks to anticipated support among Latino voters. But after starting the night behind, Biden was declared the winner early Wednesday. The margin, however, remained close enough that the Biden would not be able to gain significantly more delegates than Sanders.

But results from around the country underscored how rapidly fortunes were moving against Sanders. In Vermont, where he won more than 85 percent of the vote in 2016, he was in the low 50s. In Colorado, he won the caucuses in 2016 with nearly 60 percent of the vote. On Tuesday, he was winning with less than 40 percent.

AD

AD

Days ago, many people thought Sanders could win Minnesota over Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). On Tuesday, the state fell into Biden’s column. Biden also won Massachusetts, a state thought to be in competition between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Sanders sounded a defiant note when he addressed supporters in Burlington, Vt., and pointed to Texas and California, which together have nearly half of the more than 1,300 delegates at stake, as the linchpins of his Tuesday strategy. He also vowed to wage a fierce fight for the nomination and predicted that he would prevail and go on to defeat Trump in November.

Warren and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg remain in the race, but neither appeared to have a path to the nomination.

AD

Bloomberg spent roughly half a billion dollars with a plan to make his mark on Super Tuesday. Other than a victory in American Samoa, he was running poorly virtually everywhere and in some places with percentages so low that he would qualify for few delegates. That kind of performance will raise questions about how long he can sustain his candidacy.

Warren hoped to win her home state of Massachusetts and pick up delegates elsewhere, but she, too, was struggling to hit the threshold to qualify for delegates, though she has pledged to continue her campaign through to the convention.

AD

It will take some time to know exactly how the delegates break down from the 14 states voting on Tuesday, but based on what was happening versus what was expected, this was Biden’s night, and the final delegate numbers are certain to reflect the changed circumstances.

AD

Sanders’s victory in Vermont was expected, even though he will not win all 16 delegates as he did four years ago. In addition to Colorado, he also won Utah.

Biden’s victory in Alabama was expected, based on his strength among African Americans, but his victories in Texas, Virginia and North Carolina were hardly a given just days ago. Sanders had competed hard in those states, and pre-weekend polls — which lost their validity after South Carolina — showed a potentially close outcome. Biden also took Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma, the latter a state Sanders won in 2016.

AD

South Carolina provided a shot in the arm for Biden’s candidacy that no one could have predicted, shifting the terrain overnight. The results prompted Klobuchar and former South Bend., Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg to end their campaigns, and their immediate endorsements of Biden accelerated the consolidation.

AD

There were other elected and former elected officials who joined the Biden team at the same time. Collectively, they sent a signal to the many voters who had decided not to support Sanders but were uncertain where to put their allegiance. Establishment Democrats who a week ago were worrying about how quickly the field might shrink rushed to embrace Biden.

Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns were predicting just before Super Tuesday that the race would go far into the spring and possibly all the way to the July convention in Milwaukee. But the rapidly shifting terrain seen over the 48 hours before Tuesday’s voting changed perceptions and expectations about the balance of strength between the two leading candidates and what it may foreshadow in the coming weeks and months.

AD

The true balance won’t be known until there are complete counts from California, which could take more than a week, or anywhere else where there are questions about how many candidates met the threshold to qualify for delegates. But based on what was known Tuesday night, the race was in a far different place from what anyone expected less than a week ago.

AD

The marquee primary next week will be in Michigan. Sanders scored a major upset there four years ago against Clinton, although his victory margin was narrow. Also on the calendar next week is Missouri, a state Sanders lost by less than a percentage point and where the delegates split almost evenly. Missouri will provide another test of Biden’s and Sanders’s support among African Americans, who make up about a fifth of Democratic turnout in that state.

Because Washington state has switched from a caucus to a primary, Sanders, though favored, will have a more difficult time piling up the kind of delegate margin he did in 2016. Meanwhile, Mississippi should be fertile ground for Biden, as African Americans made up about 70 percent of the Democratic electorate there in 2016 — even more than in South Carolina.

AD

The round of primaries on March 17 includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Sanders lost Florida badly to Clinton and will face serious resistance again this year because of qualms about his left-wing agenda. He also lost Arizona and Ohio decisively. Only Illinois was close, though Sanders was on the losing end there, as well. A week after that, on March 24, Georgia holds a stand-alone primary, and there again, Biden will be favored based on the size of the African American vote.","Biden had a noticeable deficit in money and organization in the Super Tuesday states, compared with the well-resourced and well-organized Sanders.

61,61,"Aug 20, 2020",MarineLink,Interview: Hannan Carmeli & theDOCK: Fertile Grounds for Innovation,"There are many Venture Capital funds helping to drive innovation across industry. theDOCK, co-founded by Hannan Carmeli and Nir Gartzman, is unique in that it is working to connect the ports, shipping and logistics industries with primarily Israeli-based start-ups. We recently interviewed Carmeli for insights on the path and pace of the companies under theDOCK’s guise.

Hannan Carmeli, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of theDOCK, freely admits that he always wanted to be a ‘Chief Dreamer,’ a dream fulfilled with the creation of theDOCK in early 2017. “My entire career was focusing on operational aspects of large companies,” Carmeli said, citing his work for “a NASDAQ-traded software company” delivering solutions to Fortune 500 and Global 1000 enterprises. “I was engulfed in operations, with little time for (business) dreaming,” he said. Carmeli and Nir Gartzman founded theDOCK in early 2017, allowing him to connect his profession (high tech) with his passion for boating, seamanship, navigation. “I got the license to dream… and execute on it,” Carmeli said.

What is theDOCK

“If I were to describe in one sentence - theDOCK is a thematic (vertical) Venture Capital (VC) fund,” said Carmeli, noting that the domain of focus includes ports, shipping and logistics. Dubbing Israel ‘the startup nation,’ theDOCK team started out with events and activities, including Hackathons, Challenge-driven campaigns, meetups, and networking events, all sponsored by global partners aiming to tap new sources of innovation.

To date theDOCK has invested in 10 portfolio companies over the course of the two+ years, and it maintains an ‘extended portfolio’ of about 50 startups which showed promise. “Overall, we maintain in our CRM details and research data of some 300 startups to-date,” said Carmeli, with about 70% Israel-based and the remainder from around the world.

To facilitate meaningful tech innovation, theDOCK has relations with about 100 “major players,” including global terminal operators, port authorities, shipping companies, class societies, equipment manufacturers and shipyards, among others. “Of these, some 40 companies have sent representatives to various events and panels organized by us in Israel throughout the last three years. With eight of them we signed formal strategic relations,” said Carmeli. The growth to date has been palpable. “When we first mapped the number of Israeli startups which had any potential strategic play with ports, shipping and logistics back in 2017 - the number was 37. Today we count 105,” said Carmeli. theDOCK is always on the prowl for innovators, and in this regard Carmeli said that “for a startup to be interesting for us it has to fulfill three main criteria:”

1. Address a recognized market pain point. We are driven by challenges which are intimated with us by our global partners (leaders in the space).

2. Own deep technology. i.e. - have significant Intellectual Property (IP). It could be in any of the interesting and “hot” disciplines such as AI and Learning, Augmented Reality, underwater communication, energy and charging, etc.

3. Present a strong, coherent and committed team with good coverage of technology and business knowledge/expertise.

Maritime Opportunities Abound

While the maritime sectors generally have been conservative on the uptake of new technologies, Carmeli sees this as a positive, as the maritime, port and logistics sectors will have to innovate to keep up with developments in related sector, making it ripe for innovation leaps. “Back in 2017 when we started looking into it, we observed early indicators for change,” said Carmeli. First, “leaders in the space started nominating executives to new roles which did not exist up until then: CDO (Chief Digital Officer), VP Innovation etc. Maersk, Wartsila, PSA, Cargotec were a few such leaders, and indeed very quickly we connected and identified joint vision regarding innovation in the space. Also, we recall an interview by Soren Skou – Maersk’s CEO, in which when asked about who does he foresee as his competition in the future he provided a surprising answer (back then). it was not any of Maersk traditional competitors, rather he cited Amazon. This was a clear sign that things were going to change in the space.”

While theDOCK is still in its infancy, it has already experienced success.

• Orca / Liberty – Pilot benefitting both organizations around intelligent bridge assistance and fleet management.

• DockTech / Kirby – Pilot addressing depth mapping of segments of the Mississippi river in order to optimize barge load while maintaining safety measures.

• ArcusTeam – theDOCK led an investment round by syndicating additional funding (1+ USD million) on top of our own investment.

• AIDock – theDOCK’s network of mentor yielded an opportunity for one of its mentors to assume the role of COO with a portfolio company, benefitting both sides.

Partnership with leaders in the maritime space – Lloyd’s Register, ThyssenKrupp, Wartsila, and Maersk, to name a few, is a vital component of the success of start-ups under via theDOCK. “We usually sign one-year cooperation agreement which is framed as follows,” said Carmeli. “We first conduct a few sessions to understand the needs and challenges our partner would like to address. We then draft together a high-level annual plan (how many campaigns, KPIs for the number of startups and pilots to be identified etc.). Next step is carrying out the plan and delivering on the results.” The approach has the potential to benefit both sides, as theDOCK partners get an exciting deal flow of startups addressing the business/operational needs specified; while startups get access to data, knowledge and platform/equipment for running pilot programs.

While progress to date has been substantial, theDOCK team continues to eye the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the near and long-term.

“The pandemic is a game changer,” said Carmeli. “No man-made event could have ever inflicted such impact on our personal and business lives. The changes forced us to open our eyes to many new facts and observations. We can use zoom instead of travel. We may reduce office visits by using electronic bill of lading rather than get (in person) stamps on a piece of paper. These are just two examples of habits that changed (or accelerated) due to Covid19 and which might actually stick. That’s the upside.”

But there is a flipside, too. “On the other hand, business slowed down. With a few early stage startups struggling due to freeze of funding and pilots, for example. Young companies have all taken yet another look at their burn rate in order to increase the runway left before they get to the next round. The strong will survive as their market will look for efficiency, new offerings and optimized operations. These are fertile grounds for innovation.”

62,62,"Oct 7, 2020",The New York Times,Opinion | Our Leader’s Life Is at Risk. Cue the Conspiracy Theories.,"“General Harrison lived but a short time after he was installed in office,” one letter declared, and “General Taylor lived but a short time after he took his seat.” It continued, “You, sir, be careful at the king’s table what meat and drink you take.” Another reported that “I have often heard it stated by physicians, that it was an undoubted fact, that our two last Whig presidents, Generals Harrison and Taylor, came to their sudden and lamentable ends by subtle poisons.”

Those purported plots featured prominently in John Smith Dye’s “The Adder’s Den,” an 1864 conspiracy tract that treated both deaths — and the assault on Jackson, too — as parts of a “Parallax View” -style series of covert ops by Southern slaveholders. This wasn’t seen as a fringe position: The book was excerpted in The Chicago Tribune, and The New York Times ran a respectful notice that told curious readers they should “get this pamphlet and read it for themselves.”

Nor did such notions disappear after the Civil War. During the effort to impeach President Andrew Johnson, Representative James Mitchell Ashley, an Ohio Republican, declared that both Harrison and Taylor had been “poisoned for the express purpose of putting the vice presidents in the presidential office.”

By that time America had another dead president. Lincoln’s death immediately set off talk of conspiracies larger than that of John Wilkes Booth and his confederates, and Dye produced a new edition of his book blaming the same vast Southern conspiracy for Booth’s bullets. Over the years, more Lincoln theories would emerge, attributing the murder to everyone from the vice president to the Vatican.

The next president killed in office was James Garfield, shot in 1881 by a disgruntled job-seeker named Charles Guiteau. The rumor mill quickly claimed the deed had been arranged by the Republican Party’s “Stalwart” faction, whose members included Vice President Chester Alan Arthur. (One newspaper, The Baltimore American, was agnostic about whether Guiteau had acted alone, but it called the killing a coup “whether the assassin had accomplices or not.”)","Lincoln’s death immediately set off talk of conspiracies larger than that of John Wilkes Booth and his confederates, and Dye produced a new edition of his book blaming the same vast Southern conspiracy for Booth’s bullets.

“Zero ICU beds in Jackson. Very few elsewhere. Please protect yourself and your family,” Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs tweeted Thursday morning.

Zero ICU beds in Jackson. Very few elsewhere.



Please protect yourself and your family. pic.twitter.com/08CxKh6Jzd — thomas dobbs (@TCBPubHealth) November 12, 2020

There are only 106 available ICU beds remaining in the state out of 888 total, Mississippi Free Press reports. There were 1,271 new COVID-19 cases in Mississippi today.

Though there is still no mask mandate, GOP Gov. Tate Reeves, who has followed President Donald Trump’s lead and politicized the state’s response to the novel coronavirus, tweeted, “As cases rise, please take the threat seriously. None of us want to be responsible for spreading this disease to our most vulnerable loved ones.”

Reeves announced Thursday that his youngest daughter has tested positive for COVID-19.

According Mississippi Free Press, only five ICU beds remain open in Gulfport and none in Biloxi. Additionally, “There are also zero ICU beds available in Southaven and just one in nearby Olive Branch, both located in DeSoto County, where the sheriff is refusing to enforce mask and social distancing orders…In Hattiesburg, located in Forrest and Lamar counties, only one ICU bed remains (available). Greenville in Washington County is down to just one ICU bed.”

As ESSENCE previously reported, Dobbs said that white people’s refusal to wear masks and practice other safety procedures led to the increase in cases across the state.

“We’ve seen a pretty remarkable shift because early on, African-Americans accounted for basically two-thirds, or 60 percent or more, of cases and deaths,” he said on CNN. “Then over the summer, and especially going into the fall, we’ve seen that shift basically upside-down. Sixty-percent of new cases are caucasians and the deaths are nearing that also.”

Dobbs said that the state has been been working hard on safety measures, which have found “more fertile ground in the Black community.”

“As far as the case trends, we have had really pretty good uptake by a lot of folks in the Black community with masking and social distancing,” Dobbs said. “We’ve worked very aggressively to make sure that the Black community understands where the risks are and what can be done to prevent that. “And I just will say … I think big parts of the white community, especially in areas that maybe weren’t as hard-affected (previously), have not been as compliant or engaged actively with social distancing and masking. And I think that does make a difference.”

A Black Power Manifesto

By Charles M. Blow

Leading up to the 2020 presidential election, Stacey Abrams, LaTosha Brown and other grass-roots activists successfully registered an unprecedented number of Black voters in Georgia who had been stymied in the past by voter-suppression tactics. Their work brought key victories to Democratic candidates in the state and demonstrated the political power of Southern Black women.

Georgia’s recent presidential and Senate elections are relevant to the argument of the New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow in “The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto.” There are two Black Americas, he says. One is the world of those who remained in the postslavery South. The other is inhabited by those who fled the South for refuge in what he terms “destination cities” across the North and West during the Great Migration. But these cities are now broken, according to Blow, and the Great Migration has been a “stinging failure.” Blow, a son of Louisiana who recently moved back south — to Atlanta — says Black Americans must bridge this divide.

In what he believes would be “the most audacious power play by Black America in the history of the country,” Blow calls for African-Americans to reverse-migrate south, to collectively dismantle white supremacy by using their ancestral homeland as a political base. He imagines a New South where “our trauma history is not our total history.” That Black people have been returning south for at least the past 40 years, he adds, demonstrates that there is fertile ground for his idea in the region, intellectually and materially.

His is a familiar argument, revitalized by the South’s recent political developments. A genesis for Blow’s Black power proposition could have been the Black Belt nation thesis, proposed by Black Communists in the 1920s, or the agenda of the Republic of New Afrika in the 1960s. But Blow instead builds upon the political thought of the freethinking white hippies who moved to Vermont in the early 1970s with the intent of transforming the state’s conservative electoral politics. They succeeded, he says; young Black people today should follow their blueprint.","Their work brought key victories to Democratic candidates in the state and demonstrated the political power of Southern Black women.

Images above: A sign on a utility pole to deter hunters, near the old Scott-family homestead, Drew, Mississippi; Willena's brother Isaac Daniel Scott Sr. amid soybeans in Mound Bayou. Updated at 2:15 p.m. ET on September 29, 2019. I. Wiped Out “You ever chop before?” Willena Scott-White was testing me. I sat with her in the cab of a Chevy Silverado pickup truck, swatting at the squadrons of giant, fluttering mosquitoes that had invaded the interior the last time she opened a window. I was spending the day with her family as they worked their fields just outside Ruleville, in Mississippi’s Leflore County. With her weathered brown hands, Scott-White gave me a pork sandwich wrapped in a grease-stained paper towel. I slapped my leg. Mosquitoes can bite through denim, it turns out. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Cotton sowed with planters must be chopped—thinned and weeded manually with hoes—to produce orderly rows of fluffy bolls. The work is backbreaking, and the people who do it maintain that no other job on Earth is quite as demanding. I had labored long hours over other crops, but had to admit to Scott-White, a 60-something grandmother who’d grown up chopping, that I’d never done it.

“Then you ain’t never worked,” she replied. The fields alongside us as we drove were monotonous. With row crops, monotony is good. But as we toured 1,000 acres of land in Leflore and Bolivar Counties, straddling Route 61, Scott-White pointed out the demarcations between plots. A trio of steel silos here. A post there. A patch of scruffy wilderness in the distance. Each landmark was a reminder of the Scott legacy that she had fought to keep—or to regain—and she noted this with pride. Each one was also a reminder of an inheritance that had once been stolen. Drive Route 61 through the Mississippi Delta and you’ll find much of the scenery exactly as it was 50 or 75 years ago. Imposing plantations and ramshackle shotgun houses still populate the countryside from Memphis to Vicksburg. Fields stretch to the horizon. The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended. But some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger—industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you’re one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. TIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the “Delta states.” The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)

Unlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil—as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland. In Holmes County, the third-blackest county in the nation, black people make up about 80 percent of the population but own only 19 percent of the farmland. TIAA owns plantations there, too. In just a few years, a single company has accumulated a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of the African Americans who have lived on and shaped this land for centuries. This is not a story about TIAA—at least not primarily. The company’s newfound dominance in the region is merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part. But TIAA’s position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains has become a structural part of American life. The land was wrested first from Native Americans, by force. It was then cleared, watered, and made productive for intensive agriculture by the labor of enslaved Africans, who after Emancipation would come to own a portion of it. Later, through a variety of means—sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal and coercive, occasionally violent—farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people. It was aggregated into larger holdings, then aggregated again, eventually attracting the interest of Wall Street.

Owners of small farms everywhere, black and white alike, have long been buffeted by larger economic forces. But what happened to black landowners in the South, and particularly in the Delta, is distinct, and was propelled not only by economic change but also by white racism and local white power. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. They have lost 12 million acres over the past century. But even that statement falsely consigns the losses to long-ago history. In fact, the losses mostly occurred within living memory, from the 1950s onward. Today, except for a handful of farmers like the Scotts who have been able to keep or get back some land, black people in this most productive corner of the Deep South own almost nothing of the bounty under their feet.

II. “Land Hunger” Land has always been the main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi. During Reconstruction, fierce resistance from the planters who had dominated antebellum society effectively killed any promise of land or protection from the Freedmen’s Bureau, forcing masses of black laborers back into de facto bondage. But the sheer size of the black population—black people were a majority in Mississippi until the 1930s—meant that thousands were able to secure tenuous footholds as landowners between Emancipation and the Great Depression. Driven by what W. E. B. Du Bois called “land hunger” among freedmen during Reconstruction, two generations of black workers squirreled away money and went after every available and affordable plot they could, no matter how marginal or hopeless. Some found sympathetic white landowners who would sell to them. Some squatted on unused land or acquired the few homesteads available to black people. Some followed visionary leaders to all-black utopian agrarian experiments, such as Mound Bayou, in Bolivar County. From March 1901: W. E. B. Du Bois’s ‘The Freedmen’s Bureau’ It was never much, and it was never close to just, but by the early 20th century, black people had something to hold on to. In 1900, according to the historian James C. Cobb, black landowners in Tunica County outnumbered white ones three to one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 25,000 black farm operators in 1910, an increase of almost 20 percent from 1900. Black farmland in Mississippi totaled 2.2 million acres in 1910—some 14 percent of all black-owned agricultural land in the country, and the most of any state.

The foothold was never secure. From the beginning, even the most enterprising black landowners found themselves fighting a war of attrition, often fraught with legal obstacles that made passing title to future generations difficult. Bohlen Lucas, one of the few black Democratic politicians in the Delta during Reconstruction (most black politicians at the time were Republicans), was born enslaved and managed to buy a 200-acre farm from his former overseer, as the historian John C. Willis has documented in his 2000 book, Forgotten Time. But, like many farmers, who often have to borrow against expected harvests to pay for equipment, supplies, and the rent or mortgage on their land, Lucas depended on credit extended by powerful lenders. In his case, credit depended specifically on white patronage, given in exchange for his help voting out the Reconstruction government—after which his patrons abandoned him. He was left with 20 acres. In Humphreys County, Lewis Spearman avoided the pitfalls of white patronage by buying less valuable wooded tracts and grazing cattle there as he moved into cotton. (Spearman’s biographical details, too, appear in Forgotten Time.) But when cotton crashed in the 1880s, Spearman, over his head in debt, crashed with it.* Around the turn of the century, in Leflore County, a black farm organizer and proponent of self-sufficiency—referred to as a “notoriously bad Negro” in the local newspapers—led a black populist awakening, marching defiantly and by some accounts bringing boycotts against white merchants. White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children. The fate of the “bad Negro” in question, named Oliver Cromwell, is uncertain. Some sources say he escaped to Jackson, and into anonymity.

Like so many of his forebears, Ed Scott Sr., Willena Scott-White’s grandfather, acquired his land through not much more than force of will. As recorded in the thick binders of family history that Willena had brought along in the truck, and that we flipped through between stretches of work in the fields, his life had attained the gloss of folklore. He was born in 1886 in western Alabama, a generation removed from bondage. Spurred by that same land hunger, Scott took his young family to the Delta, seeking opportunities to farm his own property. He sharecropped and rented, and managed large farms for white planters, who valued his ability to run their sprawling estates. One of these men was Palmer H. Brooks, who owned a 7,000-acre plantation in Mississippi’s Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Brooks was uncommonly progressive, encouraging entrepreneurship among the black laborers on his plantation, building schools and churches for them, and providing loans. Scott was ready when Brooks decided to sell plots to black laborers, and he bought his first 100 acres. Unlike Bohlen Lucas, Scott largely avoided politics. Unlike Lewis Spearman, he paid his debts and kept some close white allies—a necessity, since he usually rejected government assistance. And unlike Oliver Cromwell, he led his community under the rules already in place, appearing content with what he’d earned for his family in an environment of total segregation. He leveraged technical skills and a talent for management to impress sympathetic white people and disarm hostile ones. “Granddaddy always had nice vehicles,” Scott-White told me. They were a trapping of pride in a life of toil. As was true in most rural areas at the time, a new truck was not just a flashy sign of prosperity but also a sort of credit score. Wearing starched dress shirts served the same purpose, elevating Scott in certain respects—always within limits—even above some white farmers who drove into town in dirty overalls. The trucks got shinier as his holdings grew. By the time Scott died, in 1957, he had amassed more than 1,000 acres of farmland.

Scott-White guided me right up to the Quiver River, where the legend of her family began. It was a choked, green-brown gurgle of a thing, the kind of lazy waterway that one imagines to be brimming with fat, yawning catfish and snakes. “Mr. Brooks sold all of the land on the east side of this river to black folks,” Scott-White told me. She swept her arm to encompass the endless acres. “All of these were once owned by black families.”

III. The Great Dispossession That era of black ownership, in the Delta and throughout the country, was already fading by the time Scott died. As the historian Pete Daniel recounts, half a million black-owned farms across the country failed in the 25 years after 1950. Joe Brooks, the former president of the Emergency Land Fund, a group founded in 1972 to fight the problem of dispossession, has estimated that something on the order of 6 million acres was lost by black farmers from 1950 to 1969. That’s an average of 820 acres a day—an area the size of New York’s Central Park erased with each sunset. Black-owned cotton farms in the South almost completely disappeared, diminishing from 87,000 to just over 3,000 in the 1960s alone. According to the Census of Agriculture, the racial disparity in farm acreage increased in Mississippi from 1950 to 1964, when black farmers lost almost 800,000 acres of land. An analysis for The Atlantic by a research team that included Dania Francis, at the University of Massachusetts, and Darrick Hamilton, at Ohio State, translates this land loss into a financial loss—including both property and income—of $3.7 billion to $6.6 billion in today’s dollars.

Jesmyn Ward: Racism is ‘built into the very bones’ of Mississippi This was a silent and devastating catastrophe, one created and maintained by federal policy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal life raft for agriculture helped start the trend in 1937 with the establishment of the Farm Security Administration, an agency within the Department of Agriculture. Although the FSA ostensibly existed to help the country’s small farmers, as happened with much of the rest of the New Deal, white administrators often ignored or targeted poor black people—denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people. After Roosevelt’s death, in 1945, conservatives in Congress replaced the FSA with the Farmers Home Administration, or FmHA. The FmHA quickly transformed the FSA’s programs for small farmers, establishing the sinews of the loan-and-subsidy structure that undergirds American agriculture today. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration created the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, a complementary program to the FmHA that also provided loans to farmers. The ASCS was a federal effort—also within the Department of Agriculture—but, crucially, the members of committees doling out money and credit were elected locally, during a time when black people were prohibited from voting. Through these programs, and through massive crop and surplus purchasing, the USDA became the safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta. The department could offer better loan terms to risky farmers than banks and other lenders, and mostly outcompeted private credit. In his book Dispossession, Daniel calls the setup “agrigovernment.” Land-grant universities pumped out both farm operators and the USDA agents who connected those operators to federal money. Large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed. The mega-farms held sway over agricultural policy, resulting in more money, at better interest rates, for the plantations themselves. At every level of agrigovernment, the leaders were white.

Major audits and investigations of the USDA have found that illegal pressures levied through its loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from black to white farmers, especially in the period just after the 1950s. In 1965, the United States Commission on Civil Rights uncovered blatant and dramatic racial differences in the level of federal investment in farmers. The commission found that in a sample of counties across the South, the FmHA provided much larger loans for small and medium-size white-owned farms, relative to net worth, than it did for similarly sized black-owned farms—evidence that racial discrimination “has served to accelerate the displacement and impoverishment of the Negro farmer.” In Sunflower County, a man named Ted Keenan told investigators that in 1956, local banks had denied him loans after a bad crop because of his position with the NAACP, where he openly advocated for voting rights. The FmHA had denied him loans as well. Keenan described how Eugene Fisackerly, the leader of the White Citizens’ Council in Sunflower County, together with representatives of Senator James Eastland, a notorious white supremacist who maintained a large plantation there, had intimidated him into renouncing his affiliation with the NAACP and agreeing not to vote. Only then did Eastland’s man call the local FmHA agent, prompting him to reconsider Keenan’s loan. A landmark 2001 investigation by the Associated Press into extortion, exploitation, and theft directed against black farmers uncovered more than 100 cases like Keenan’s. In the 1950s and ’60s, Norman Weathersby, a Holmes County Chevrolet dealer who enjoyed a local monopoly on trucks and heavy farm equipment, required black farmers to put up land as collateral for loans on equipment. A close friend of his, William Strider, was the local FmHA agent. Black farmers in the area claimed that the two ran a racket: Strider would slow-walk them on FmHA loans, which meant they would then default on Weathersby’s loans and lose their land to him. Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. Analyzing the history of federal programs, the Emergency Land Fund emphasizes a key distinction. While most of the black land loss appears on its face to have been through legal mechanisms—“the tax sale; the partition sale; and the foreclosure”—it mainly stemmed from illegal pressures, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and speculators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. Discriminatory loan servicing and loan denial by white-controlled FmHA and ASCS committees forced black farmers into foreclosure, after which their property could be purchased by wealthy landowners, almost all of whom were white. Discrimination by private lenders had the same result. Many black farmers who escaped foreclosure were defrauded by white tax assessors who set assessments too high, leading to unaffordable tax obligations. The inevitable result: tax sales, where, again, the land was purchased by wealthy white people. Black people’s lack of access to legal services complicated inheritances and put family claims to title in jeopardy. Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn’t a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner.

In interviews with researchers from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in 1985, Henry Woodard Sr., an African American who had bought land in the 1950s in Tunica County, said he had managed to keep up for years through a combination of his own industry, small loans from the FmHA and white banks, and the rental of additional land from other hard-pressed black landowners. Then, in 1966, the activist James Meredith—whose 1962 fight to integrate Ole Miss sparked deadly riots and a wave of white backlash—embarked on the famous March Against Fear. The next planting season, Woodard recalled, his white lenders ignored him. “I sensed that it was because of this march,” he said. “And it was a lady told me—I was at the post office and she told me, she said, ‘Henry, you Negroes, y’all want to live like white folks. Y’all don’t know how white folks live. But y’all are gonna have to be on your own now.’ ” Woodard’s story would have been familiar to countless farmers in the Delta. In Holmes County, a crucible of the voting-rights movement, a black effort to integrate the local ASCS committees was so successful that it was subject to surveillance and sabotage by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official agency created by Governor J. P. Coleman in 1956 to resist integration. Black landowners involved in running for the committees or organizing for votes faced fierce retaliation. In 1965, The New Republic reported that in Issaquena County, just north of Vicksburg, the “insurance of Negroes active in the ASCS elections had been canceled, loans were denied to Negroes on all crops but cotton, and ballots were not mailed to Negro wives who were co-owners of land.” Even in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, formal and informal complaints against the USDA poured out of the Delta.

These cases of dispossession can only be called theft. While the civil-rights era is remembered as a time of victories against disenfranchisement and segregation, many realities never changed. The engine of white wealth built on kleptocracy—which powered both Jim Crow and its slave-state precursor—continued to run. The black population in Mississippi declined by almost one-fifth from 1950 to 1970, as the white population increased by the exact same percentage. Farmers slipped away one by one into the night, appearing later as laborers in Chicago and Detroit. By the time black people truly gained the ballot in Mississippi, they were a clear minority, held in thrall to a white conservative supermajority. Nikole Hannah-Jones: Freedom Summer, 1964: Did it really change Mississippi? Mass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. But some white people undeniably would have organized it this way if they could have. The civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin reported in 1956 that documents taken from the office of Robert Patterson, one of the founding fathers of the White Citizens’ Councils, proposed a “master plan” to force hundreds of thousands of black people from Mississippi in order to reduce their potential voting power. Patterson envisioned, in Rustin’s words, “the decline of the small independent farmer” and ample doses of “economic pressure.”

An upheaval of this scale and speed—the destruction of black farming, an occupation that had defined the African American experience—might in any other context be described as a revolution, or seen as a historical fulcrum. But it came and went with little remark. IV. The Catfish Boom World War II transformed America in many ways. It certainly transformed a generation of southern black men. That generation included Medgar Evers, a future civil-rights martyr, assassinated while leading the Mississippi NAACP; he served in a segregated transportation company in Europe during the war. It included Willena’s father, Ed Scott Jr., who also served in a segregated transportation company. These men were less patient, more defiant, and in many ways more reckless than their fathers and grandfathers had been. They chafed under a system that forced them to relearn how to bow and scrape, as if the war had never happened. In the younger Scott’s case, wartime service sharpened his inherited land hunger, pushing him to seek more land and greater financial independence, both for himself and for his community. One of his siblings told his biographer, Julian Rankin, that the family’s deepest conviction was that “a million years from now … this land will still be Scotts’ land.” Upon his return to the Delta, Scott continued down his father’s hard path, avoiding any interface with the FmHA and the public portions of the agrigovernment system, which by that time had spread its tendrils throughout Sunflower and Leflore Counties. He leaned on the friendships he and his father had made with local business owners and farmers, and secured credit for growing his holdings from friendly white bankers. Influenced by the civil-rights movement and its emphasis on community solidarity and activism, Scott borrowed from Oliver Cromwell’s self-sufficiency playbook too. He used his status to provide opportunities for other black farmers and laborers. “Daddy said that everyone who worked for us would always be able to eat,” Willena Scott-White told me. He made sure of more than that. Scott sent relatives’ and tenants’ children to school, paid for books, helped people open bank accounts and buy their own land. When civil-rights activists made their way down for Mississippi’s Freedom Summer, in 1964, he packed up meals and brought them to rallies.

When Scott-White thinks of her father, who died in 2015, she seems to become a young girl again. With allowances for nostalgia, she recalls a certain kind of country poorness-but-not-poverty, whereby children ran barefoot and worked from the moment they could walk, but ate well, lived in houses with solid floors and tight roofs, and went to high school and college if they showed skill. “We lived in something like a utopia,” Scott-White told me. But things changed at the tail end of the 1970s. Plummeting commodity prices forced highly leveraged farmers to seek loans wherever they could find them. Combined with the accelerating inflation of that decade, the beginnings of the farm-credit crisis made farming at scale without federal assistance impossible. Yet federal help—even then, two decades after the Civil Rights Act—was not available for most black farmers. According to a 2005 article in The Nation, “In 1984 and 1985, at the height of the farm crisis, the USDA lent a total of $1.3 billion to nearly 16,000 farmers to help them maintain their land. Only 209 of those farmers were black.” As Rankin tells it in his biography, Catfish Dream, Scott made his first visit to an FmHA office in 1978. With the assistance of Vance Nimrod, a white man who worked with the black-owned Delta Foundation, a nonprofit promoting economic advancement for black Mississippians, Scott secured an operating loan for a season of soybeans and rice from the FmHA agent Delbert Edwards. The first time was easy—although, crucially, Nimrod accompanied him to the Leflore County office, in Greenwood. When Scott returned the next year without Nimrod, driving a shiny new truck the way his father used to, Edwards asked where Nimrod was. According to Rankin, Scott told the agent that Nimrod had only come to help secure that first loan; he wasn’t a business partner. When Edwards saw Scott’s vehicle, he seemed perplexed. “Who told you to buy a new truck?” he asked. Edwards ended up denying the requested loan amount.

At the same time, Edwards and the FmHA were moving to help local white farmers weather the storm, often by advising them to get into raising catfish. Commercial catfish farming was a relatively new industry, and it had found a home in the Delta as prices for row crops crashed and new legislation gave the USDA power and incentive to build up domestic fish farming. FmHA agents pushed white farmers to convert wide fields on the floodplain into giant catfish ponds, many of which would become contract-growing hubs for Delta Pride Catfish, a cooperative that quickly evolved into a local monopoly. The federal government poured millions of dollars into the catfish boom by way of FmHA loans, many of which were seized on by the largest white landowners, and kept those white landowners solvent. Mississippi became the catfish capital of the world in the 1970s. But the FmHA did not reach out to Scott, nor is there evidence that it supported the ambitions of any black farmers who might have wanted to get into catfish. Scott decided to get into catfish anyway, digging eight ponds in fields where rice had grown the season before. He found his own catfish stocks and learned the ins and outs of the industry pretty much on his own. Scott finished digging his ponds in 1981, at which point, according to Rankin, Edwards of the FmHA visited the property and told him point-blank: “Don’t think I’m giving you any damn money for that dirt you’re moving.” The Mississippi FmHA would eventually compel Edwards to provide loans for Scott’s catfish operation for 1981 and 1982. But as court records show, the amount approved was far less than what white catfish farmers usually got—white farmers sometimes received double or triple the amount per acre that Scott did—and enough to stock only four of the eight ponds. (Edwards could not be reached for comment on any of the episodes recounted here.)

Scott’s Fresh Catfish opened in 1983. As a marker outside the old processing shed now indicates, it was the first catfish plant in the country owned by an African American. But discrimination doomed the enterprise before it really began. Without enough capital, Scott was never able to raise fish at the volume he needed. He claimed in court and later to Rankin that he had also been denied a chance to purchase stock in Delta Pride—a requirement to become a contract grower—because he was black. Without access to a cooperative, he had to do the processing and packaging himself, adding to the cost of his product. In 2006, Delta Pride and Country Select Catfish were combined into a new business entity, Consolidated Catfish Producers. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Consolidated Catfish said that no employee at the new company could “definitively answer” questions about Scott or alleged discrimination against him.

Scott was in his 60s by the time his plant got off the ground. The effort took a toll. He slowly went blind. Arthritis claimed his joints. His heart began to fail. The plant limped quietly through the ’80s and then shut down. Lenders began the process of foreclosing on some of Scott’s cropland as early as 1983. In 1995, the FmHA approved a request from Scott to lease most of his remaining acres. The USDA itself had claimed most of his land by the late 1980s. The downfall of the Scott catfish enterprise was proof of the strength and endurance of what the federal government would later state could be seen as a federally funded “conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.” The Scotts were not small-timers. They had the kind of work ethic and country savvy that are usually respected around the Delta. When the powers that be finally prevailed over Ed Scott Jr., they had completed something decisive, something that even today feels as if it cannot be undone. V. Farmers in Suits But land is never really lost, not in America. Twelve million acres of farmland in a country that has become a global breadbasket carries immense value, and the dispossessed land in the Delta is some of the most productive in America. The soil on the alluvial plain is rich. The region is warm and wet. Much of the land is perfect for industrialized agriculture.

Some white landowners, like Norman Weathersby, themselves the beneficiaries of government-funded dispossession, left land to their children. Some sold off to their peers, and others saw their land gobbled up by even larger white-owned farms. Nowadays, as fewer and fewer of the children of aging white landowners want to continue farming, more land has wound up in the hands of trusts and investors. Over the past 20 years, the real power brokers in the Delta are less likely to be good ol’ boys and more likely to be suited venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers, and agribusiness consultants who run farms with the cold precision of giant circuit boards. One new addition to the mix is pension funds. Previously, farmland had never been a choice asset class for large-scale investing. In 1981, what was then called the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) released a report exploring a proposal by a firm seeking pension-investment opportunities in farmland. The report essentially laughed off the prospect. The authors found that only about one dollar of every $4,429 in retirement funds was invested in farmland.

But commodity prices increased, and land values rose. In 2008, a weakened dollar forced major funds to broaden their search for hedges against inflation. “The market in agricultural land in the U.S. is currently experiencing a boom,” an industry analyst, Tom Vulcan, wrote that year. He took note of the recent entry of TIAA-CREF, which had “spent some $340 million on farmland across seven states.” TIAA, as the company is now called, would soon become the biggest pension-fund player in the agricultural real-estate game across the globe. In 2010, TIAA bought a controlling interest in Westchester Group, a major agricultural-asset manager. In 2014, it bought Nuveen, another large asset-management firm. In 2015, with Nuveen directing its overall investment strategy and Westchester and other smaller subsidiaries operating as purchasers and managers, TIAA raised $3 billion for a new global farmland-investment partnership. By the close of 2016, Nuveen’s management portfolio included nearly 2 million acres of farmland, worth close to $6 billion.

Investment in farmland has proved troublesome for TIAA in Mississippi and elsewhere. TIAA is a pension company originally set up for teachers and professors and people in the nonprofit world. It has cultivated a reputation for social responsibility: promoting environmental sustainability and respecting land rights, labor rights, and resource rights. TIAA has endorsed the United Nations–affiliated Principles for Responsible Investment, which include special provisions for investment in farmland, including specific guidelines with regard to sustainability, leasing practices, and establishing the provenance of tracts of land. Each black farmer who left the region represented a tiny withdrawal from one side of a cosmic balance sheet and a deposit on the other side. The company has faced pushback for its move into agriculture. In 2015, the international nonprofit Grain, which advocates for local control of farmland by small farmers, released the results of an investigation accusing TIAA’s farmland-investment arm of skirting laws limiting foreign land acquisition in its purchase of more than half a million acres in Brazil. The report found that TIAA had violated multiple UN guidelines in creating a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to invest in farmland without transparency. The Grain report alleges that when Brazil tightened laws designed to restrict foreign investment, TIAA purchased 49 percent of a Brazilian company that then acted as its proxy. According to The New York Times, TIAA and its subsidiaries also appear to have acquired land titles from Euclides de Carli, a businessman often described in Brazil as a big-time grileiro—a member of a class of landlords and land grabbers who use a mix of legitimate means, fraud, and violence to force small farmers off their land. In response to criticism of TIAA’s Brazil portfolio, Jose Minaya, then the head of private-markets asset management at TIAA, told WNYC’s The Takeaway: “We believe and know that we are in compliance with the law, and we are transparent about what we do in Brazil. From a title perspective, our standards are very focused around not displacing individuals or indigenous people, respecting land rights as well as human rights … In every property that we have acquired, we don’t just do due diligence on that property. We do due diligence on the sellers, whether it’s an individual or whether it’s an entity.”

TIAA’s land dealings have faced scrutiny in the United States as well. In 2012, the National Family Farm Coalition found that the entry into agriculture of deep-pocketed institutional investors—TIAA being an example—had made it pretty much impossible for smaller farmers to compete. Institutional investment has removed millions of acres from farmers’ hands, more or less permanently. “Pension funds not only have the power to outbid smaller, local farmers, they also have the long-term goal of retaining farmland for generations,” the report noted. Asked about TIAA’s record, a spokesperson for Nuveen maintained that the company has built its Delta portfolio following ethical-investment guidelines: “We have a long history of investing responsibly in farmland, in keeping with our corporate values and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). As a long-term owner, we bring capital, professional expertise, and sustainable farming practices to each farm we own, and we are always looking to partner with expansion-minded tenants who will embrace that approach and act as good stewards of the land.” The company did not comment on the history of any individual tract in its Delta portfolio. But even assuming that every acre under management by big corporate interests in the Delta has been acquired by way of ethical-investment principles, the nature of the mid-century dispossession and its multiple layers of legitimation raise the question of whether responsible investment in farmland there is even possible. As a people and a class, black farmers were plainly targets, but the deed histories of tax sales and foreclosures don’t reveal whether individual debtors were moved off the land because of discrimination and its legal tools.

In addition, land records are spotty in rural areas, especially records from the 1950s and ’60s, and in some cases it’s unclear exactly which records the investors used to meet internal requirements. According to Tristan Quinn-Thibodeau, a campaigner and organizer at ActionAid, an anti-poverty and food-justice nonprofit, “It’s been a struggle to get this information.” The organization has tried to follow the trails of deeds and has asked TIAA—which manages ActionAid’s own pension plan—for an analysis of the provenance of its Delta portfolio. Such an analysis has not been provided. What we do know is that, whatever the specific lineage of each acre, Wall Street investors have found a lucrative new asset class whose origins lie in part in mass dispossession. We know that the vast majority of black farmland in the country is no longer in black hands, and that black farmers have suffered far more hardships than white farmers have. The historian Debra A. Reid points out that “between 1920 and 1997, the number of African Americans who farmed decreased by 98 percent, while white Americans who farmed declined by 66 percent.” Referring to the cases studied in their 2001 investigation, Dolores Barclay and Todd Lewan of the Associated Press observed that virtually all of the property lost by black farmers “is owned by whites or corporations.” The foundation of these portfolios was a system of plantations whose owners created the agrigovernment system and absorbed thousands of small black-owned farms into ever larger white-owned farms. America has its own grileiros, and they stand on land that was once someone else’s.

VI. A Deeper Excavation As we drove through the patchwork remnants of the Scotts’ land, Willena Scott-White took me to the site of Scott’s Fresh Catfish. Gleaming steel silos had turned into rusting hulks. The ponds were thick with weeds and debris. The exterior walls of the plant itself had collapsed. Rusted beams lay atop ruined machinery. Fire ants and kudzu had begun nature’s reclamation.

Late in Ed Scott Jr.’s life, as he slipped into Alzheimer’s, Willena and his lawyer, Phil Fraas, fought to keep his original hopes alive. In the Pigford v. Glickman lawsuit of 1997, thousands of black farmers and their families won settlements against the USDA for discrimination that had occurred between 1981 and the end of 1996; the outlays ultimately reached a total of $2 billion. The Scotts were one of those families, and after a long battle to prove their case—with the assistance of Scott-White’s meticulous notes and family history—in 2012 the family was awarded more than $6 million in economic damages, plus almost $400,000 in other damages and debt forgiveness. The court also helped the Scotts reclaim land possessed by the department. In a 1999 ruling, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia acknowledged that forcing the federal government to compensate black farmers would “not undo all that has been done” in centuries of government-sponsored racism. But for the Scotts, it was a start. “The telling factor, looking at it from the long view, is that at the time of World War I there were 1 million black farmers, and in 1992 there were 18,000,” Fraas told me. The settlements stemming from Pigford cover only specific recent claims of discrimination, and none stretching back to the period of the civil-rights era, when the great bulk of black-owned farms disappeared. Most people have not pushed for any kind of deeper excavation.

Any such excavation would quickly make plain the consequences of what occurred. During my drive with Scott-White, we traveled through parts of Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington Counties, three of the counties singled out by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard University research group, as among the worst in the country in terms of a child’s prospects for upward mobility. Ten counties in the Delta are among the poorest 50 in America. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on all 74,000 U.S. census tracts, four tracts in the Delta are among the lowest 100 when it comes to average life expectancy. More than 30 tracts in the Delta have an average life expectancy below 70. (The national average is 79.) In some Delta counties, the infant mortality rate is more than double the nationwide rate. As if to add gratuitous insult to injury, a new analysis from ProPublica finds that, as a result of the Internal Revenue Service’s intense scrutiny of low-income taxpayers, the Delta is audited by the IRS more heavily than any other place in the country. In sum, the areas of deepest poverty and under the darkest shadow of death are the ones where dispossession was the most far-reaching.","Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land.
“Land Hunger” Land has always been the main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi.
White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children.
Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks.
Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn’t a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner."

Roderick Red Named to Top 50 Under 40 List

Mississippi Business Journal named Roderick Red, a filmmaker and producer, and owner of Red Squared Productions, LLC (140 Wesley Ave.) in Jackson, to its Top 50 Under 40 business owners list during a ceremony at the Old Capitol Inn on Thursday, April 25. Red's friend Ryder Taff, a financial adviser and consultant, nominated him for the award.

Red, a lifelong Jackson native, went to Murrah High School and earned a bachelor's degree in broadcast production from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011. He started Red Squared Productions in 2012. The company makes videos for companies, nonprofits and individuals in Jackson, and beyond. Red Squared also makes commercials and documentaries for local nonprofits and businesses.

His company has also worked on projects such as film features for the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program and Springboard to Opportunities, as well as a promotional video for the City of Jackson and a commercial for Entergy Mississippi.

Red told the Jackson Free Press that he believes MBJ chose him for the list primarily for his work in building up his company.

""I've been at this for around seven years doing lots of work around Jackson and Mississippi,"" Red says. ""I've been working at being the best entrepreneur I can be to grow Red Squared and make it successful. To make that happen lately, I've been procuring some big contracts with the City of Jackson.""

One of the most recent projects Red has taken up with the City is for ""Fertile Ground,"" a public-art project designed to inspire dialogue about food access in Jackson. The City launched the project after receiving a $1 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2018.

Officials contracted Red Squared Productions to produce a documentary about what the City is doing for the project. The documentary will air at Fertile Ground's conclusion in May 2020, when the city will unveil art installations in downtown Jackson, the Virden Addition and the Jackson Medical Mall district.

Red Squared Productions is also a member of Southern Cult, a network of freelance graphic designers, filmmakers, musicians and more in the Jackson area who collaborate on local projects. Red also operates FLEET Creative, a creative networking organization that meets bimonthly.

Architect Jonathan Tate was living and working in Memphis, Tennessee, when Hurricane Katrina ensnared New Orleans in 2005. Instinctively drawn to the Big Easy, he later moved there for the opportunity to observe the reconstruction effort and investigate architecture’s role in it.

“Embedded in the practice from the beginning was a desire to look around and postulate,” said Tate, referring to the namesake office he founded in the Lower Garden District in 2011.

Indeed, Office of Jonathan Tate (OJT) brings a probing, “investigative” (the word and its cognates have a special resonance for the small firm) spirit to wide-ranging issues relevant to New Orleans. Its projects, which span everything from low-rise housing to planning initiatives, often combine research with philanthropic funding and aspects of community building.

Related Article The Life and Death of the Tiny Home Trend

But however diverse its portfolio, OJT has become virtually synonymous with the Starter Home* series it has developed over the better part of the past decade. These contemporary takes on speculative urban infill were awarded the 2018 AIA National Housing Award and the 2019 AIA National Honor Award (for 3016 St. Thomas and No. 4-15, Saint Thomas/Ninth, respectively), and cemented the firm’s selection for the 2020 American Academy of Arts and Letters Architecture Prize back in April.

“Our investigations started off with a very purposeful [question], ‘How can we knock down barriers?’” said designer Maggie Lloyd, alluding to OJT’s first foray into the Starter Home* series six years ago. In turn, the office gained insights—about market dynamics, say, and architecture’s complicity in pernicious socioeconomic narratives—that “have permeated everything else that we do,” Lloyd added.

Recently, OJT has been expanding the scope of its practice to the surrounding region and designing spaces for experimental nonprofit development models. Seeing New Orleans redefine itself after Katrina helped Tate and his team (which currently numbers nine) understand that every city is always going to be rebuilding in some way. “It allowed us to be more adaptable to malleable urban situations,” Lloyd said.

Like the two previous “generations” in OJT’s Starter Home* project, the S. Saratoga Street homes are a contemporary twist on affordable speculative housing aimed at first-time homeowners. The new infill units re-subdivide irregular New Orleans lots and incorporate contextual cues into their architecture for added depth. Developed in partnership with the real estate investing platform Small Change, the nation’s first equity crowdfunded single-family units work to address housing inequalities, Tate said. The projects, he added, examine “the economics around housing” and consider “why thoughtful design wasn’t available in a speculative market.”

Ground Notations (2020)

Created as a part of the public art installation Fertile Ground in Jackson, Mississippi, Ground Notations works to reconceptualize land use and educate residents about food insecurity. The site-specific installation inscribes industrial farming patterns across the historic Smith Park in the heart of the city. The geometrically ordered row crops, long bench seating, and ground mural were completed in April, but the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the official opening of the project and the corresponding Fertile Ground Expo to 2021.

In addition to affordable housing and public art, OJT has been developing a new operational model for boutique urban hotels that leverages local artist communities toward boosting small-town tourism. “It’s a play on an affordable housing model wrapped around a business model,” Tate said. Travelers Hotel in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and the soon-to-be-completed Magazine Street hotel in New Orleans are managed by artist co-ops, whose members are afforded apartments and studio spaces above the guest rooms.

IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. You have probably seen the photos from the recent historic floods in the Midwest. Farms under feet of water, broken grain silos spilling out of last year’s harvest, drowned pigs, roads washed out, lives ruined.

As farmers in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and other states start to dry out and assess the damage, one big factor will be the dirt left behind– the soil that was washed away by the water. And I’m talking about the topsoil– rich in organic matter, and the key to the incredible fertility of Midwestern fields.

Mahdi Al-Kaisi is professor of Soil Management and Environment at Iowa State University in Ames. He’s here to discuss it with me. Welcome to Science Friday.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Thanks for having me, Ira.

IRA FLATOW: You’ve been in Iowa, one of the states hit hardest by the floods last month. What does it look like out there now?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: There is significant damage to agriculture and commercial properties and infrastructure on the east side of the state, by the Mississippi River, also on the western side, by the Missouri, where there is approximately 145,000 acres covered with water, flooded, compared to 2011, about 127,000. So there is significant damage to agriculture, business, and farmland.

IRA FLATOW: Well, let’s talk about the farmland. Let’s talk about a flooded farm. What happens to the topsoil there? How do you assess whether the topsoil has been eroded or lost?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Generally, when you have significant amount of water running off from rivers and streams, it’s going to carry a significant amount of the topsoil. And as you mentioned earlier, topsoil is the most productive part of this whole system to support crop production, growth, and animal production, and so on.

So these sediments and these soils rich, with organic matter and nutrient, won’t be carried to lakes and rivers, and basically is going to create a lot of environmental problems, clean up, and loss of productivity in the short term and the long term.

IRA FLATOW: Is there any way to measure how much loss of the topsoil there was?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Generally, in the research, what we do– that basically there is a setting you set, rain simulator on the field, and the flumes to collect the amount of sediments that run off with the different rain intensity. And basically, you could extrapolate from that measurement into the watershed or on the field.

As you have a larger scale and big landscape, it’s going to be very difficult to assess how much soil was lost. But there’s going to be a significant amount of losses, given the amount of volume of water flooded by the Missouri, where proximately 11 million acre foot of water runoff [INAUDIBLE] cover these areas, comparing to, historically, about 7.3 million acre feet in 1952.

IRA FLATOW: Wow.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: So that give you perspective.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Is there anything farmers can do to make up for the loss? Can they add the organic matter back or can they put the microbiome back?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: It definitely is going to be a lot of work. It’s going to be physical, biological, and chemical damage to the flooded soil. And what the farmers could do, actually, after the flooding recede and the ground is workable, there are several issues they can work on.

And basically, they have to have some plan grown on these flooded soils, especially now we are doing the growing season and the planting season. And some of the fields, maybe they cannot get to it. But leaving the soil bare is going to basically compromise the microbial community and this whole system.

So what we are recommending to the farmers, even if they couldn’t plant the whole season, they need to put some crops, whether cover a crop or any crop to grow, because some of these fungi basically live on the soil system, and recycling the nutrients to become available to the plants for production.

IRA FLATOW: So you wanted– so you’re saying a cover crop will actually get the microbiome that was lost or drowned in the soil to regrow?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Exactly. Because they need a medium to live on, and especially the mycorrhiza fungi, it’s critical to live on the colonized root system. And they have a symbiotic relationship between [INAUDIBLE] system, [INAUDIBLE] the carbohydrates at the same time, recycling nutrients, especially phosphorous, from the organic form into mineral form to become available to the plants.

So having living plants in the solar system is going to be very healthy to rejuvenate and compensate, or mitigate, the losses of these microbial communities due to the flooding condition.

IRA FLATOW: There’s also an opposite kind of problem, my understanding. That is soil deposited on the fields, right? It’s been moved–

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Right.

IRA FLATOW: –and gone someplace else and deposited.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Right. And especially when you look at the eastern part of Nebraska, for example, there is a lot– sandy soils are deposited on the areas. And there is a different degree of deposit. If you have a small amount, the farmers could work it out in the soil system when the soil condition dry.

But if you have a huge amount accumulated on the surface, that’s going to require some structural changes and some sand removal to bring this all back to its original condition so it’ll be farmable and you could plant the crops on these soils. So that’s going to be a lot of work, a lot of expense associated with managing these soils physically and chemically, as well.

IRA FLATOW: And are we then talking about a lost year in productivity for some of these farmers as they work? To get the soil back, they’re not going to be planting their crop? It may be too late? The soil may be too watery?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Exactly. You know, we are during the growing season now, especially the planting season, and the critical time is going to start mid April. And if you get close to May 20, May 15, every time there is a delay is going to be a decline in the productivity. So some of the areas may be not recovered till late May or June, so that will be a lost season to the farmers.

So basically, what they’re going to do is just manage the field and work on it and prepare it for the next season, putting cover crop and trying to do soil testing in the upcoming season to make sure that there is enough nutrient data to add to the soil system and so on.

IRA FLATOW: Given that we may be seeing more and more of these floods due to climate change, can farmers do anything to prepare for the next big flood?

MAHDI AL-KAISI: There is a lot of management issue that’s associated with these unpredictable events due to climate change, and these are a good indicator– what we have, these extremes with the rain events and amount of snow we got, for example, here in Iowa. From January to March, we got almost 54 inches of snow accumulated.

That’s equivalent to over 4 inches of water, and the soil could process approximately one to two inches. So the excess water is going to runoff. So if you have a system– for example, you use conservation practices, using [INAUDIBLE] or using cover crop– that’s going to build the soil system, build soil health, increase the soil storage capacity, increase the soil permeability. So when you have extreme events the excess water could be processed and moved into the soil system, reducing the surface runoff and prevent any potential erosion and sediment loss, are topsoil losses, to the streams and rivers.

So there is a lot of practices that need to be implemented. It could mitigate some of these extreme events.

IRA FLATOW: Well, that’s some terrific information, Dr. Al-Kaisi. Thank you for taking time to be with us today.

MAHDI AL-KAISI: Thank you, Ira. I appreciate it.

70,70,3 weeks ago,Yale Environment 360,How the Loss of Soil Is Sacrificing America’s Natural Heritage,"A new study points to a stunning loss of topsoil in the Corn Belt — the result of farming practices that have depleted this once-fertile ground. Beyond diminished agricultural productivity and more carbon in the atmosphere, it is a catastrophic loss of an irreplaceable resource.

Geologically speaking, I grew up in a small farm town on the Des Moines lobe, a huge tongue-shaped remnant of glacial activity that reaches south across central Iowa. All around us were mollisols with a deep A-horizon — a type of rich black topsoil visible in farm fields for miles in every direction. In school we were taught only one thing about that soil: to be proud of it. It was a given, a blessing, a moral fact. In a sense, it seemed to have no history. Yet when I was very young, I surely must have met old people — relatives from northwest Iowa — whose elders had helped break the prairie in the late 19th century, using heavy sod-plows and the great teams of animals needed to pull those plows through tenacious tallgrass. The way I was taught, it felt, somehow, as though the prairie’s providential job had been to keep the soil ready for a time when we would need it. By the time I was in school it was hard to find living prairie anywhere in Iowa. It had nearly all been turned. You hear many different numbers regarding that black Iowa soil. It’s often repeated that the topsoil — the nutrient-rich A horizon — was some 14 to 16 inches deep when the prairie was first broken, a fantastic depth of fertility rivaled only by some regions in the Ukraine. By the mid-1970s — roughly a century after the prairie was broken — it was reported that, in places, half of that topsoil had already been lost to erosion from wind and runoff. There was a lot of talk about soil conservation, of course — about contour plowing and set-aside programs that paid farmers to keep marginal land out of cultivation. Yet year by year, the soil loss went on. There were also large-scale erosion events, like the floods of 2008 and 2013, in which parts of Iowa lost in a week what experts maintained was a sustainable yearly loss: 5 tons of soil per acre. It was possible to get a local sense of how much topsoil was being lost — in particular fields and drainages. But it’s been hard to get a region-wide, landscape-scale sense of the extent of Midwestern soil erosion — until now.

At best, 24 percent of Corn Belt topsoil has been removed by farming. At worst, 46 percent has been lost.

In late February, three geoscientists from the University of Massachusetts — Evan Thaler, Isaac Larsen, and Qian Yu — published a paper called, “The extent of soil loss across the U.S. Corn Belt.” Using high-definition satellite imagery, a recent soil carbon index, and soil spectral data, they were able to show that across the Corn Belt — which includes all of Iowa and parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana — A-horizon soil was essentially no longer present on convex slopes. What they found on those slopes was B-horizon soil — subsoil in other words, with minimal fertility, which is only exposed after A-horizon soil has been removed. What does that look like? The paper includes a satellite photo of a bare field near Clear Lake, Iowa. The low areas in the field are medium to dark brown — an indicator of A-horizon soil. But the high spots are tan and beige — the color of B-horizon soil. By calculating the exposure of B-horizon soils across the region, the scientists were able to estimate the overall loss of A-horizon soil. The number they arrived at is shocking. “We predict,” they wrote, “[that] the A-horizon has been completely removed from 35±11% of the cultivated area of the Corn Belt.” Plus or minus 11 percent is a large range of uncertainty. But its meaning is plain. At best, 24 percent of the topsoil in the Corn Belt has been completely removed by farming. At worst, 46 percent has been lost. It’s worth being clear here. The authors aren’t talking about reduced soil fertility or loss of mineral nutrients. They’re talking about the complete removal of the medium in which crops are grown — the utter bankruptcy of the organic richness that lay for centuries under the tallgrass prairie. The authors argue, in a sense, that we’ve been farming in the dark, though they’re never quite that blunt. Previous estimates of erosion, they write, “may have greatly underestimated the extent of A-horizon loss, and therefore the thickness or mass of soil that has been eroded from hillslopes in the Corn Belt.”

Inevitably, the paper goes on to calculate the economic implications of these findings. And that’s how the agricultural press (which has scarcely noticed this study so far) has read it: The loss of topsoil on 30 million acres may result in a possible $3 billion annual loss “to Midwestern farmers.” I have to admire the narrowness of that interpretation, which is completely consistent with the economic assumptions that have governed industrial farming since World War II. The catastrophic loss of an irreplaceable resource — what you might call an essential part of our common earthly heritage — is construed as an annual loss of income to the farmers who operate those farms. The narrowness of these assumptions — driven by official U.S. Department of Agriculture policy and the shared economic interests of chemical and seed companies — has made it possible to farm in a way that is little more than slow strip-mining. What drives the research behind this new study isn’t just geological or financial cost-accounting. It’s also carbon-accounting. The soils that have been eroded were once rich in organic carbon, which has also, of course, been sacrificed over time. Since World War II, the lost fertility once inherent in those carbon-rich soils has been replaced by chemical fertilizer, without adding carbonaceous material of any kind. It’s an old — and, in big ag circles, forgotten — maxim that good farmers don’t really think about raising crops: they think about improving the soil. But if all you add to soil is water and chemicals — nitrogen fertilizer (anhydrous ammonia) and glyphosate, that ubiquitous pesticide — erosion is all you can expect. We’ve been getting our food the wrong way. Industrial farming is like holding up the grocer at gunpoint for a head of lettuce — “efficient” in the short term, but eventually disastrous.

As practiced now, industrial farming is a major contributor to the global crisis of atmospheric carbon.

The good news in this study is the same old good news we’ve been hearing for years now. The main cause of soil erosion isn’t water runoff; it’s tillage — disturbing the soil in preparation for planting. The solution is a familiar one: no-till agriculture, which means direct seeding through the stubble of last year’s crops. No-till farming prevents erosion — because the soil is stabilized by last year’s roots — and it also adds carbon to the soil. As the authors note, however, long-term no-till farming (“for at least three consecutive years”) occurs on only 15 percent of the acreage in “the upper Mississippi watershed, the heart of the Corn Belt.” Good farming should mean ongoing carbon sequestration. Agricultural land should be a carbon sink. But as practiced now — with massive reliance on fossil fuels, on soils stripped of organic carbon — industrial farming is a major contributor to the global crisis of atmospheric carbon.","Yet year by year, the soil loss went on.

It's been three years since Memphis and Ole Miss have faced off in a rivalry that dates in 1921. Here's what Ole Miss fans might want to know about their first opponent of the 2019 college football season

1. Memphis coach Mike Norvell is a hot coaching candidate?

In his fourth season, Mike Norvell is one of the brightest and most successful young coaches in the country. He has a 26-14 record over the past three seasons, including two AAC West championships.

Memphis has also finished the last two seasons ranked in the top-5 nationally in total offense. It's why this year will make it three years of speculation for Power Five coaching job due to his offensive wizardry, strong recruiting and continuing the Tigers' rise to national prominence.

2. Memphis has strong NFL pedigree

Like Ole Miss, the Tigers had a player drafted over the past six years

Recent Tigers who've made the leap include Anthony Miller, Bobby McCain, Martin Ifedi, Jake Elliott, Genard Avery and the two latest draftees in Darrell Henderson and Tony Pollard. And that doesn't count longtime Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski who is entering his 14th year with the New England Patriots.

3. Who is Memphis QB Brady White?

White is entering his second year leading the Tigers offense after passing for 3,296 yards and 26 touchdowns last season.

Like Rebels quarterback Matt Corral, White has West Coast ties being raised in California and starting his career at Arizona State. He also just completed his Master's degree in sports commerce this summer.

Link Copied



There was supposed to be a peak. But the stark turning point, when the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. finally crested and began descending sharply, never happened. Instead, America spent much of April on a disquieting plateau, with every day bringing about 30,000 new cases and about 2,000 new deaths. The graphs were more mesa than Matterhorn—flat-topped, not sharp-peaked. Only this month has the slope started gently heading downward. To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. This pattern exists because different states have experienced the coronavirus pandemic in very different ways. In the most severely pummeled places, like New York and New Jersey, COVID-19 is waning. In Texas and North Carolina, it is still taking off. In Oregon and South Carolina, it is holding steady. These trends average into a national plateau, but each state’s pattern is distinct. Currently, Hawaii’s looks like a child’s drawing of a mountain. Minnesota’s looks like the tip of a hockey stick. Maine’s looks like a (two-humped) camel. The U.S. is dealing with a patchwork pandemic.

What’s happening is not one crisis, but many interconnected ones. As we shall see, it will be harder to come to terms with such a crisis. It will be harder to bring it to heel. And it will be harder to grapple with the historical legacies that have shaped today’s patchwork. I. The Patchwork Experience A patchwork pandemic is psychologically perilous. The measures that most successfully contain the virus—testing people, tracing any contacts they might have infected, isolating them from others—all depend on “how engaged and invested the population is,” says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. “If you have all the resources in the world and an antagonistic relationship with the people, you’ll fail.” Testing matters only if people agree to get tested. Tracing succeeds only if people pick up the phone. And if those fail, the measure of last resort—social distancing—works only if people agree to sacrifice some personal freedom for the good of others. Such collective actions are aided by collective experiences. What happens when that experience unravels? “We had a strong sense of shared purpose when everything first hit,” says Danielle Allen, a political scientist at Harvard. But that communal mindset may dissipate as the virus strikes one community and spares another, and as some people hit the beaches while others are stuck at home. Patchworks of risk and response “will make it really hard for the public to get a crisp understanding of what’s happening,” Rivers says.

In one future scenario, the nation splinters. When national news diverges from local reality, “suspicions about whether the epidemic was a hoax will find fertile ground in places with a more ambiguous experience of the disease,” says Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University. Confused people will retreat to the comfort of preexisting ideologies. The White House’s baseless attempts to claim victory will further divide the already fragmented states of America. “In the face of medical uncertainty, people make decisions by returning to their own groups, which are very polarized,” says Elaine Hernandez, a sociologist at Indiana University at Bloomington. “They’ll want to avoid being stigmatized, so they’ll follow what people in their networks are doing [even if] they don’t really want to go out.” Read: Why the coronavirus hits kids and adults so differently Prevention is physically rewarding in the long term, but not emotionally rewarding in the short term. People who stay home won’t feel a pleasant dopamine kick from their continued health. Those who flock together will feel hugs and sunshine. The former will be tempted to join the latter. The media could heighten that temptation by offering what Lincoln calls “disparity in spectacle.” Fringe exceptions like anti-lockdown protests and packed restaurants, she says, are more dramatic and telegenic than people responsibly staying at home, and so more likely to be covered. The risk is that rare acts of incaution will seem like normal behavior.

“There’s a natural saturation point for images of health systems in crisis,” Lincoln adds, and newly overwhelmed hospitals might be ignored in favor of fresher narratives. The local media are better positioned to pick up the nuances of a patchwork story, but of the counties that had reported cases of COVID-19 by early April, 37 percent had lost their local newspaper in the past 15 years. If the virus does indeed resurge and states need to shut down again, people may not comply, because they’ll be misinformed and distrustful. A second future is also possible. “When this outbreak began in China, everyone said, Thank God it’s not here,” Jha says. “It moved to Western Europe and people said, They have government-run health care; that won’t happen here. Then it hit New York and Seattle, and people said, It’s the coasts. At every moment, it’s more tempting to define the other who is suffering, as opposed to seeing the commonalities we all share.” But as the virus spreads, Americans may run out of others to discriminate against. “Crises are political only until they are personal,” wrote the journalist Elaina Plott, in a piece about a Louisiana woman who convinced her conservative friends to take the coronavirus seriously after her own husband fell sick. Similarly, President Donald Trump’s claims that the virus will go away on its own will ring false to supporters who know someone fighting for breath.

There are signs that this is happening. While Trump’s popularity predictably surged during the crisis, his “rally around the flag” boost was a blip compared with the prolonged peaks of other leaders. Polls have also shown that pandemic partisanship is narrowing, with Democrats and Republicans more united in how seriously they view the threat. Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwestern University, has been surveying 200 people a day since mid-March, and “70 to 75 percent of people support most social-distancing measures,” she says. “Those are really large numbers in a society where 52 percent is often viewed as huge support. We rarely see that outside of authoritarian polling. Americans are by and large reading information in a very similar way.” Economic indicators support this view. Even in conservative states, activity plummeted before leaders closed businesses, and hasn’t rebounded since restrictions were lifted. As such, Redbird doesn’t share the widely held fear that Americans have become inured to social distancing and will refuse to suffer through it again. The bigger risk, she says, is that demoralizing bouts of shutdowns and reopenings will nix any prospect of economic recovery. “You only get to say Go out, trust me once,” she says. “They won’t believe you the second time.” Both possible futures are confounded by three aspects of COVID-19 that make the pandemic hard to grasp, and that are amplified by the patchwork effect. First, the disease progresses slowly. It seems to take an average of four or five days, and a maximum of 14, for an infected person to show symptoms. Those symptoms can take even longer to become severe enough for a hospital stay, and longer still to turn fatal. This means that new infections can take weeks to manifest in regional statistics. May’s declining cases are the result of April’s physical distancing, and the consequences of May’s reopenings won’t be felt until June at the earliest. This long gap between actions and their consequences makes it easy to learn the wrong lessons.

Read: Why some people get sicker than others Second, the pandemic is shaped by many factors. Social distancing matters, but so do testing capacity, population density, age structure, wealth, societal collectivism, and luck. Many countries that successfully controlled the coronavirus used masks; New Zealand did not. Many had decisive leaders; Hong Kong did not. It is easy to look at a patchwork and create just-so stories about why one place succumbed while another triumphed. But no single factor can explain differences across nations or regions. Third, the disease spreads unevenly. Some cases infect no one, and others infect many. In Washington State, a choir member infected 51 fellow singers during a few hours of rehearsal. In Ghana, a worker in a fish factory infected 533 colleagues. These “super-spreader events,” which are rare but pivotal, become especially important when cases dip. They mean that an untroubled region may continue that way for some time, but that once cases start growing, they can really grow. If a state reopens and sees no immediate spike in cases, is that because it was justified, because insufficient time has passed, because other things went right, or because unlucky super-spreader events haven’t yet happened? In a patchwork, these questions will be asked millions of times over, and many answers will be wrong. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a hurricane or some other disaster that will come and go, signaling an obvious moment when recovery can begin. It is not like the epidemics of fiction, which get worse until, after some medical breakthrough, they get better. It is messier, patchier, and thus harder to predict, control, or understand. “We’re in that zone that we don’t see movies made about,” says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University.

II. The Patchwork Response A patchwork was inevitable, especially when a pandemic unfolds over a nation as large as the U.S. But the White House has intensified it by devolving responsibility to the states. There is some sense to that. American public health works at a local level, delivered by more than 3,000 departments that serve specific cities, counties, tribes, and states. This decentralized system is a strength: An epidemiologist in rural Minnesota knows the needs and vulnerabilities of her community better than a federal official in Washington, D.C. But in a pandemic, the actions of 50 uncoordinated states will be less than the sum of their parts. Only the federal government has pockets deep enough to fund the extraordinary public-health effort now needed. Only it can coordinate the production of medical supplies to avoid local supply-chain choke points, and then ensure that said supplies are distributed according to need, rather than influence. Instead, Trump has repeatedly told governors to procure their own tests and medical supplies. Read: Trump is putting himself at risk for COVID-19 Michael Kilkenny of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department, in West Virginia, says his state found itself short on swabs, disinfectant, and protective equipment; unable to compete in the global market; and abandoned by the White House. “It felt terrible,” he says. “We’ve been making homemade masks, or using bleach solutions. We had to fend for ourselves.” While reporting on pandemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018, I heard health-care workers repeatedly joke that the 15th article of the country’s constitution is “Débrouillez-vous”—French for “Figure it out yourself.” It’s a droll resignation that when resources are scarce, the government won’t fix your problems, and it’s on you to make do. The U.S., a country that’s more than 400 times wealthier, has seemingly adopted “Débrouillez-vous” as national policy.

Even health officials in well-off states aren’t comfortable with a situation in which preparedness has more to do with wealth and connections than need. “We have everything we need,” says Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist for Utah, where Governor Gary Herbert moved quickly to buy and secure tests and supplies. “But we did it in a very capitalistic way, and that’s not the best way to deal with a pandemic.” States have tried to level the playing field on their own. Wyoming ended up with few cases but a glut of testing reagents, which it provided to Colorado and Utah when those states saw spikes, Dunn says. “There’s a small barter system, but it’s not sustainable and it doesn’t work at scale,” she says. “I don’t know if Colorado is lacking supplies. If they have a huge spike, that’ll impact Utah. It’s in our interests to make sure everyone’s protected, and without federal coordination, that’s hard to do.” In some cases, the federal government has actively undermined the states. Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, tried to buy protective equipment, but was thrice outbid by the federal government; he ended up using the New England Patriots’ jet to fly 1.2 million masks over from China, many of which turned out to be faulty. When Larry Hogan, Maryland’s Republican governor, procured 500,000 tests from South Korea, he kept them guarded in an undisclosed location so they wouldn’t be seized by the feds. This is not federalism working as intended, where different tiers of government work together. Instead of devolving control to the states, the Trump administration has ceded the U.S. to the virus.

The U.S. now heads into summer only slightly more prepared to handle the pandemic that cost it so dearly in the spring. According to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, the U.S. is now testing 366,000 people a day—a record high. But experts estimate that the country needs 500,000 to several million daily tests. Here, too, a patchwork is apparent. An analysis by NPR and Harvard’s Global Health Institute showed that in early May, only nine states were doing sufficient testing, and another 31 weren’t even halfway to their requisite threshold. “I would have hoped for more, considering the cost of that time,” says Natalie Dean, a statistician at the University of Florida. Stay-at-home orders were necessary but ruinous, economically and emotionally. Their purpose was to buy time for the country to catch its breath, steel its hospitals, and roll out a public-health plan capable of quashing the virus. Many such plans exist. Umpteen think tanks and academics have produced their own road maps for dialing society back up. These vary in their details, but are united in at least having some. By contrast, the Trump administration’s guidelines for “opening up America again” are so bereft of operational specifics that they’re like a cake recipe that simply reads, “Make cake.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared a more detailed guide but was blocked from releasing it by the White House, according to an Associated Press report. The guidance it has released seems carefully worded to avoid the term guidelines, as if it’s “trying to fly under the radar,” Wiley says. “The abdication of federal responsibility has left states with little choice but to ease the most disruptive physical-distancing measures without the testing data that would make us more confident that cases won’t rapidly surge.” (The CDC finally and quietly released a slightly abridged version of its fuller report on Tuesday.)

Read: There’s one big reason the U.S. economy can’t reopen The Trump administration “isn’t known for consistency of messaging, so we’ll never put our full faith in that,” says Kilkenny of West Virginia. “We pretty much ran our own state here.” At the time of this writing, only five states and the District of Columbia are still under some form of lockdown. A few, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Montana, eased restrictions after their caseloads had fallen to low single digits. Idaho is reopening cautiously, despite being one of the less affected states. Georgia went all in on April 24, reopening gyms, restaurants, theaters, salons, and bowling alleys at a point when it had five of the 10 counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates nationwide, and was testing just a fifth as many people as it needed to. By contrast, Utah revived businesses a week later, when it had more than enough tests for everyone with symptoms, all their contacts, high-risk groups, and even random slices of the populace. Still, Dunn, the state epidemiologist, is nervous. “If we could stick it out for even a couple more months of stricter social distancing, it would do us a world of benefit,” she says. “There are embers everywhere, and they could ignite any moment.” Some states never put their fires out at all: Texas, Alabama, Kansas, Arizona, Mississippi, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and others all reopened while cases were still rising.

Anne Applebaum: The rest of the world is laughing at Trump Legality aside, domestic-travel bans are of limited use. Even China’s extraordinary quarantine of Wuhan merely delayed the virus from reaching other parts of the mainland by three to five days. Much like social distancing, such measures only buy time. The better strategy is not to try and prevent the virus from traveling, but to build a public-health system nimble enough to catch it when it arrives. Don’t build one big wall; instead, ready a thousand nets. In this, the U.S. is also behind. Prevented health threats are less visible than present ones, which means that successful public-health departments tragically make the case for their own diminishment. Since 2008, underfunded local departments have lost more than 50,000 jobs. Even now, Cincinnati’s health department has furloughed 36 percent of its staff. “How can you have a system that’s meant to be at the front line of the defense while it’s losing the staff it needs?” Alleyne asks. Some states are trying to make up for these losses by hiring battalions of contact tracers. These people will call every infected person, talk through their needs, ask for names of anyone they’ve had close or prolonged contact with in the past two days, and call those contacts, too. The process isn’t complicated, but it is laborious. Experts have estimated that the U.S. needs 100,000 to 300,000 contact tracers, and the nation has been slow to recruit them. Selena Simmons-Duffin of NPR reported that only North Dakota had recruited enough as of May 7, although six more states and the District of Columbia were set to.

Things are improving, though. When Danielle Allen of Harvard canvassed several mayors in mid-April, they weren’t taking contact tracing seriously. When she spoke with them again in May, “they were on top of it,” she says. “I was blown away by how much changed in three weeks.” New York State alone is planning to hire 6,000 to 17,000 contact tracers, while California is aiming for 20,000. “This really is the best tool we have to manage the pandemic until we have a safe and effective vaccine,” says Crystal Watson at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Will this system, combined with mask wearing and hand-washing, be enough to contain a patchwork pandemic? Complicating matters, people with COVID-19 can spread the coronavirus before showing symptoms. And yet, that hasn’t fazed other countries. South Korea has been rightly praised for its success, and though one nightclub-goer recently sparked a surge of at least 168 cases, the country seems to have contained this new outbreak too. Basic public-health measures have similarly worked in countries as diverse as Iceland, Jordan, Singapore, Germany, and New Zealand. And they have suppressed epidemics of the past, from smallpox in the 19th century to Ebola in 2014. “Some silver bullet isn’t going to save us. We can save ourselves,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at Yale. “We have very old-school tools that beat fucking smallpox.”

These inequities will likely widen. Even before the pandemic, inequalities in poverty and access to health care “were concentrated in southern parts of the country, and in states that are politically red,” says Tiffany Joseph, a sociologist at Northeastern University. Not coincidentally, she says, those same states have tended to take social-distancing measures less seriously and reopen earlier. The price of those decisions will be disproportionately paid by black people. Adam Serwer: The coronavirus was an emergency until Trump found out who was dying Vulnerability to COVID-19 isn’t just about frequently discussed biological factors like being old; it’s also about infrequently discussed social ones. If people don’t have health insurance, or can afford to live only in areas with poorly funded hospitals, they cannot fight off the virus as those with more advantages can. If people work in poor-paying jobs that can’t be done remotely, have to commute by public transportation, or live in crowded homes, they cannot protect themselves from infection as those with more privilege can. These social factors explain why the idea of “cocooning” vulnerable populations while the rest of society proceeds as normal is facile. That cocooning already exists, and it is a bug of the system, not a feature. Entire groups of people have been pushed to the fringes of society and jammed into potential hot zones. Of the 100 largest clusters of COVID-19 in the U.S., nearly all have occurred in prisons, meatpacking plants, nursing homes, and psychiatric or developmental-care facilities. (The only exceptions are a naval vessel and three power plants; the infamous Grand Princess cruise is only No. 148 on the list.)

These places, along with homeless shelters and immigrant detention centers, are hubs for outbreaks that can easily spread to the surrounding communities. Prisons and nursing homes have staff and visitors who live in nearby towns. Large prisons, in particular, are usually situated in rural areas with small community hospitals that can be easily overrun by an outbreak. And many employees in nursing homes and meatpacking plants are immigrants who care for the nation’s elderly and process its steaks while also being cut off from health care by the Trump administration’s policies. They are both more likely to get sick, and less likely to get better. This point cannot be overstated: The pandemic patchwork exists because the U.S. is a patchwork to its core. New outbreaks will continue to flare and fester unless the country makes a serious effort to protect its most vulnerable citizens, recognizing that their risk is the result of societal failures, not personal ones. “People say you can’t fix the U.S. health system overnight, but if we’re not fixing these underlying problems, we won’t get out of this,” says Sheila Davis of Partners in Health. “We’ll just keep getting pop-ups.” Leaders can specifically place testing sites in poor, black, and brown communities, rather than the rich, white areas where they tend to be concentrated. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for example, is turning 24 churches in low-income areas into testing centers, while Maryland Governor Larry Hogan placed a testing facility in the heart of the predominantly black Prince George’s County. Officials can remove people from risky environments: Leann Bertsch, who directs the North Dakota Department of Corrections, has argued that prisoners should be freed if they are over 50, have serious illnesses, or are within two years of parole or release. A bipartisan group of 14 senators has made a similar call for decarceration.

Policies can also support people in protecting themselves. Essential workers earn low hourly wages and cannot afford to miss a shift, even if they have symptoms. “The only way to prevent them from going to work is to give them paid sick leave,” Ray says. The same goes for a minimum living wage, hazard pay, universal health care, stipends for people who are self-isolating, debt moratoriums, rent freezes, food assistance, and services to connect people with existing support. The pandemic discourse has been dominated by medical countermeasures like antibody tests (which are currently too unreliable), drugs (which are not cure-alls), and vaccines (which are almost certainly at least a year away). But social solutions like paid sick leave, which two in three low-wage workers do not have, can be implemented immediately. Imagine if the energy that went into debating the merits of hydroxychloroquine went into ensuring hazard pay, or if the president, instead of wondering out loud if disinfectant could be injected into the body, advocated for health care for all? “We have decades of social-science research that tells us these things work,” says Courtney Boen, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s a question of political will, not scientific discovery.” And while a vaccine will protect against only COVID-19 (if people agree to take it at all), social interventions will protect against the countless diseases that may emerge in the future, along with chronic illnesses, maternal mortality, and other causes of poor health. “This pandemic won’t be the last health crisis the U.S. faces,” Boen says. “If we want to be on better footing the next time, we want to reduce the things that put people at risk of being at risk.” Of all the threats we know, the COVID-19 pandemic is most like a very rapid version of climate change—global in its scope, erratic in its unfolding, and unequal in its distribution. And like climate change, there is no easy fix. Our choices are to remake society or let it be remade, to smooth the patchworks old and new or let them fray even further.","The U.S. is dealing with a patchwork pandemic.

Black people have largely been expelled from the US agricultural landscape. In 1920, nearly a million Black farmers worked on 41.4 million acres of land, making up a seventh of farm owners. Today, only about 49,000 of them remain, making up just 1.4 percent of the nation’s farm owners, and tending a scant 4.7 million acres—a nearly 90 percent loss.



This didn’t happen by accident. Since Emancipation, Black farmers have had to fight for a share of this country’s fertile ground, due to a history of racist policies and land theft. But modern sustainable agriculture owes much to Black agriculturalists, explained Leah Penniman, co-director of Soul Fire Farm in upstate New York and author of Farming While Black, on a recent episode of Bite.

Starting in the 17th century, European slave traders who forcibly moved Africans to this continent stole not just their lives and labor but also considerable agricultural knowledge, she said. The rice empire that developed in the early-US Carolinas, for instance, flourished on the farming traditions of the Senegambia region of West Africa.

Enslaved people also maintained underground farming traditions from the homeland. “Our ancestral grandmothers, when faced with the very likely possibility of being snatched up, kidnapped and forced into trans-Atlantic slave ships, gathered up the seed that their families had been saving for generations—their okra, cowpea millet, sorghum, black rice—they braided that seed into their hair,” she said. They “believed, against all odds in a future on soil—that their descendants would need to inherit that precious seed.”

Black farmers innovated farming methods that remain at the core of sustainable agriculture today.

After the post-Emancipation promise of “40 acres and a mule” crumbled under the weight of President Andrew Johnson’s racism, Penniman noted, Black agriculturalists were relegated to sharecropping, an arrangement that generated considerable wealth for the white planter class but saddled farmers with poverty-inducing debt.

“It wasn’t until the early 1900s that Black farmers began to save just enough money here and there to start to purchase meager parcels—usually 2.5 acres, five acres,” she said. Over that time, Black farmers innovated methods that remain at the core of sustainable agriculture today. George Washington Carver, a pioneering professor at Tuskegee University in Alabama, has long been trotted out during Black History Month for his achievements in finding new uses for the peanut. He’s actually a towering figure who should be known for much more than peanut mastery.

The whole reason Carver wanted farmers to grow peanuts was because he was trying to convince them to plant nitrogen-fixing legumes into diverse crop rotations, which would improve the soil in a region that had been burned by decades of mono-crop cotton farming. Carver also developed a system for disseminating his university’s research to surrounding farmers through workshops and demonstrations, as well as helping them troubleshoot problems they were encountering. Carver’s system would later take form nationwide as the US Department of Agriculture’s extension program, Penniman said.

Black farm ownership peaked in 1920. Around that time, the Ku Klux Klan and other groups led a “swift and severe backlash” to terrorize independent Black farmers, she added. These vigilante efforts went along with a set of US government policies—detailed in this great 2019 Atlantic article by Vann R. Newkirk II—that effectively expropriated Black-owned farmland, pushing it into the hands of white people. During the 20th century, the price of farmland rose by a factor of 52—making it yet another vehicle for wealth-building that African-Americans were systemically denied access to. The steady rise in land values, which has continued into the 21st century, makes it prohibitively expense for new farmers to break into agriculture, meaning that white dominance of farmland maintains plenty of momentum.

Penniman is part of a growing movement to reclaim Black farmers’ hard-won place in our country’s agriculture. Soul Fire Farm, the project she co-directs in Petersburg, N.Y., “focuses on training the next generation of Black and brown farmers, as well as providing food and medicine for our community,” she said. The farm is part of a coalition of groups “claiming sovereignty and calling for reparations of land and resources so that we can grow nourishing food and distribute it in our communities.”





Soul Fire Farm also leads the Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust, which calls on “good-hearted, good-minded people” to donate land, which will then be farmed by people of color. She said the trust has “several hundred acres” in the New York/New England queued up for transfer over the next decade; and that several other similar trusts are setting up nationwide.

Penniman said she realizes that such grassroots efforts, relying on the goodwill of white landowners, are just a beginning—not nearly enough to undo the racist legacy of land theft and agricultural-labor exploitation that dates to the origin of white settlement on the continent. Making a significant amount of farmland available to people of color and Native Americans whose ancestors were dispossessed will require a serious reparations program that includes land reform—that is, transferring some territory from wealthy, white landholders and huge investment funds to young farmers of color.

“I doubt the existing power structure and the existing status quo will go so far,” Penniman said. “It would require a fundamental shift in our relationship to the earth.”

","In 1920, nearly a million Black farmers worked on 41.4 million acres of land, making up a seventh of farm owners.
Since Emancipation, Black farmers have had to fight for a share of this country’s fertile ground, due to a history of racist policies and land theft.
Over that time, Black farmers innovated methods that remain at the core of sustainable agriculture today.
Around that time, the Ku Klux Klan and other groups led a “swift and severe backlash” to terrorize independent Black farmers, she added.

74,74,"Jan 22, 2020",Jackson Free Press,"OPINION: Love Letter to Jackson: You Need My Grind, Sweat and Tears","Dear Jackson,

If people really took time to get to know the soul of you, truly taking in the good with the bad, loving you would come easy. Anybody who has heard of Jackson, even those not from here can immediately vomit out a list of negatives concerning you, a predominantly black capital city. We often hear: ""Jackson? You mean Jacktown? Oh nooo, they're murderers, thieves, STD ridden, ratchet thugs."" Or, ""Capitol Street? Nah, I don't feel safe on that side of Jackson."" Or, ""There's nothing to do in Jackson. Don't make no sense for the taxes to be that high with that many potholes.""

I'm not romanticizing away all your flaws. I see the displaced homeless community as I drive up and down the crater-ridden streets, cursing under my breath as my car's rear-end scrubs against the jagged potholes, many unmarked. I read the countless articles documenting the blood spilled from innocent children, young men and women doing everyday things like I do. They are murdered on a day that started like any other, only to end in wails and gut-wrenching screams from their loved ones haunted by the question, ""Why my baby?""

The public schools are underfunded, understaffed and structurally compromised. I've sat in high-school classrooms, flipped through their battered textbooks, and talked to students with immature and negligent parents who only get hot meals when they decide to come to school. Many of our neighborhoods are unkempt, full of abandoned and condemned houses that reek of perpetuated brokenness.

I have family and friends with hearts of gold who have become hardened by racial disparity and poverty, and the only vision now is to do what it takes to survive, even if that includes robbing, selling drugs, scamming or selling their bodies for money. Jobs are scarce, and too many companies are ridden with discrimination and favoritism. As an educated, black woman millennial, I know the struggle of finding a job in your field and being paid your worth. Instead, we hustle three to four jobs of low pay just to make ends meet. On top of that, corruption has long defined capital-city politics.

That being said, I can't lie and say that I don't understand why you are so hard to love. If I didn't know better, I would do what most have already done—move to a more progressive city—but that's not how love works. When I think of you, Jackson, I think of how my siblings and I played up and down the Queens in the '90s, parking our bikes on the lawn of the candy ladies, roller skating, playing freeze tag early in the morning while waiting on the bus headed to Raines Elementary.

I think about the summers I spent at my grandma's house in the Bottom, helping her renovate the duplex next door, learning how to properly water her immaculate gardens and grocery shopping with her every Saturday at the Walmart on Ellis Avenue. She always bought us the big bag of Lifesaver Gummies. I think about the one-dollar movies I saw with my dad behind the Metrocenter and eating Cinnamon Sugar Pretzels at Auntie Annie's while shopping for school clothes with my mom.

I remember fondly coming back home to work my first 8-5 p.m. big-girl job at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in 2014. I would leave work and on the drive home through west Jackson, I'd see children outside playing, young men walking home with their friends, laughing, all sweaty from sports, and high schoolers with their instruments if they weren't still on the field practicing formations.

When I moved to West Capitol Street, I would witness the same things: parents getting up every day, pushing through the daily grind and monitoring their babies as they ran around with glee in the yard. It always warms my heart to see kids being kids and families doing what should be done to protect their children and ensure they are loved and free as they can be.

Each day I get to spend walking my puppy around downtown, I fall in love a little more with the hidden art murals, the architectural beauty of our historic buildings and the rich legacy I can almost taste with every breath. That's my reality of you, Jackson, my capital city, and just because many families are fighting disparity each day, and some of the communities are not as shiny and new as they once were, Jackson is building legacy with every generation and is now at a place of peak potential.

Most drive through you and see abandonment, emptiness, a shell of what used to be. I see a blank canvas, a fertile ground to plant seeds of innovation and progressive solutions. I see opportunity to not only rebuild, but build better.

I'll say it again: Jackson, Miss., is the new mecca for innovation and forward progress and will be an example for cities nationwide with similar back stories. I refuse to leave you right when you need my grind, sweat and tears to help set you on a hill where your light can shine. Despite those that hate you and can't see your heart, I know I'm not alone when I say I see you. I will fight for your integrity and freedom, and most importantly, I love you.

75,75,"Nov 27, 2019",Jackson Free Press,Kern Pratt’s Long Road: ‘That’s the Blues’,"Mississippi may arguably be more awash with musical talent than any state in the nation. As the gestation point for the blues, the fertile football of ground between Vicksburg and Memphis is the wellspring of a profound musical legacy.

Though the blues progenitors are long gone and the second wave of Delta bluesmen is dying off, the region continues to percolate with musical dynamism rooted in the blues tradition. Singer-songwriter and ace guitarist Kern Pratt is one of those who have stepped up to carry forward the music of the Delta.

Pratt, 54, grew up in Greenville, Miss. His mother died when he was 7 years old. Pratt's father owned the local Western Auto store, and it was there that Pratt first encountered the bluesmen who would become his musical avatars—Calet Emphrey (B.B. King's long-time drummer), Eddie Shaw and Eugene Powell.

""I was 7 or 8 years old when I decided that playing the blues was what I wanted to do. By the time I was 10 I was playing in a band,"" Pratt remembers.

""When I was 16, I went on the road with Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds—they had that big hit 'Don't Pull Your Love.' My first stadium gig was with them. There were 60,000 people, and I literally peed my pants—I had spandex britches on.""

During this time Pratt also gigged with blues harp artist Willie Foster, who played in Muddy Waters' band. ""Me and Willie played at Po Monkey's, outside Merigold, and many other blues joints. I played with T Model Ford, who didn't start playing guitar until he was 50 years old—he lived to be close to 100, so that turned out to be a pretty good run for him,"" Pratt says.

Since those halcyon days, Pratt has become well known on the Mississippi blues-festival circuit, amassing numerous performances at the Mississippi Delta Blues Festival and the B.B. King Homecoming in Indianola. In 2018, Pratt had a sold-out tour in Italy as co-headliner in the ""An Evening with the Blues"" tour.

Pratt also has an amicable working relationship with Bobby Rush. ""I've known Bobby Rush for over 30 years. Bobby asked me, 'Kern, how many times have we done this festival?' I said, 'Mr. Bobby, I ain't really sure."" He said, 'I think we've done about 22 of these together.""

After putting out a couple of records that ""didn't matter,"" Pratt released his well-received breakout album, ""Broken Chains,"" in 2015. The record was engineered by Nelson Blanchard, the lead singer for the band Louisiana Leroux. ""It's an album about breaking away from the chains of drug addiction. I OD'd five times—it's been a long road, but that's the blues."" The record contains the echoes of the great bluesmen who have influenced Pratt. In Pratt's guitar one can discern the spare, clean phrasing of B.B. King.

But Pratt endows each note with a trembling intensity that indelibly stamps the music as his own.

Pratt's newest album, ""Greenville, MS ... What About You?"" will be released Dec. 1, on the Endless Blues Records label. Pratt says the album is in a similar vein as ""Broken Chains"" but includes a different ensemble of musical talent. The album will include the late Gregg Allman's horn section of Marc Franklin and Kris Jensen. The producer of the record, Bob Dowell, plays trombone and the Hammond B3 organ, as well as bass. ""I want to break Bob's hands,"" Pratt says, laughing. ""No one should be able to do the things he does—he's just too damn good.""

Denise Owen, Pratt's backing singer for several years and now his partner, lends powerful vocal support—singing lead on one song and singing a duet with Pratt on another. She also plays percussion.

When asked about the state of the blues today, Pratt pauses. ""Of course the blues are alive and well, but they're going to be different. It's like Christone 'Kingfish' Ingram—my lord, he's a monster. There are some good young players coming up. A lot of people think the blues have to come from the Delta. But a lot of people take it wrong. They look at these kids coming up, a lot of whom aren't from the Delta, and they say, 'They ain't got no soul. They haven't paid any dues.' And I think they're wrong. Because these kids are working on their craft and perfecting their craft, and I think that's just as much paying dues as if you gig in a juke joint. If you're perfecting your craft, you're paying your dues.""

77,77,"May 29, 2019",Jackson Free Press,OPINION: A Changing Culture in Jackson and Mississippi,"Culture is the pattern in which we live as small family units, neighborhoods, cities, nations and a world. It's like a tidal wave, constantly changing how it moves and comes ashore; it's adaptive. In this adaptation, there are a few factors, which I learned about in my Sunday school class with Andy Sauerwein, a professor at Belhaven University, and Paul Rankin, an elder of our church, that contribute to the changes: participation, making things and exploration.

There is always an exchange in and out between each factor, one to another. These dictate how a culture breathes, grows and dies.

I like to think about it in the ways of baking. In kneading dough, as a person adds a new ingredient, that particular one is finding its place and seeking to balance itself with the other ingredients for optimal flavor and texture. Culture is a delicate kneading of making things, exploring and participating.

The three factors may seem self-explanatory, but let's look at them briefly. In the age of technology, people make new products just as fast as we can blink. You have those like Tesla, Gates, Jobs—they're constantly making new things and/or innovating them. If they're not making them, they're exploring new frontiers toward newer tech. Recently, there's the talk of the global race toward 5G technology that is supposed to be 20 times faster than 4G. This is a good example of exploration. The participation is the one way most people will contribute culturally. I believe it's the life and blood of culture.

As the song says, ""People make the world go round."" We, as the everyday people, are participants in local culture and beyond.

Let's look at Jackson and Mississippi. There's a new culture rising across our city and state. Because of my food and agriculture background, I believe there is no culture without agriculture. Around the Jackson area, we've seen our food culture and palate transforming with new food trucks popping up, a food hall, new bars and lounges, and restaurants bringing something fresh to our plates. In farming, we are seeing a rise in sustainable practices, and small farms growing and in turn bringing more to our food market. We are seeing our culture transform, and we're participating in it.

Just this past week, Jackson hosted ArtPlace America's 2019 annual ArtPlace Summit. The Mississippi Museum of Art and other organizations came together to invite hundreds of artists, creatives, thinkers and doers from across the nation and some islands, too. I had the pleasure to run into some of them.

The feedback I got from them about their experience at the summit and in the city was uplifting. They raved about the amazing things that are happening right now and historically. A few of them questioned me by asking, ""Why isn't Jackson a hub for art?"" I believed and hoped that they all left inspired and hopeful for Jackson and our greater Mississippi culture.

As we are in the midst of cultivation within our local culture, I must pose a few questions: How are we actively and intentionally exploring, participating and making things to contribute to our culture? What place does each of us have? What responsibility do we hold, here and now?

These questions we must answer ourselves and to no one else, but here's the opportunity to choose your role. Whatever your passion may be—your skill, your pastime—you contribute to our culture. Where you shop, live, go to church, whether you go to church at all or not. Who you choose to support through time, money, voting and work.

All of these things in our day-to-day patterns aren't just makeshifts but truly hold a place of permanence in the lives of our families, friends and neighbors in the city, and in our unique state. Jackson is changing. Mississippi is changing. New developments like the Fertile Grounds project, new flags like the Stennis flag, and new people like myself are taking root here and cultivating culture for today and tomorrow.

78,78,"Aug 6, 2019",Honolulu Civil Beat,Why Trump's Stoking Of White Racial Resentment Makes Working-Class Americans Worse Off - Honolulu Civil Beat,"Many white men say they feel threatened by the increasing presence and success of minorities in the workplace.

As social scientists, we wondered if there is any evidence to support this perceived economic threat, a perception that can provide fertile ground for current rounds of racist and xenophobic political messaging.

Our work at the Center for Employment Equity at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, involves using Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data to explore workplace discrimination and diversity in states and cities across the U.S. Our aim is to discover and promote more equitable workplaces.

In our most recent report, called “Race, States and the Mixed Fate of White Men,” we examined the connection between minority populations and the job prospects of white men in private-sector companies.

C-SPAN

White Male Privilege

Social scientists generally agree on three research findings about white men in the U.S. and the notion that they are losing their unearned but expected racial privileges.

First, white men at every education level are more likely than women and non-Asian minorities to get access to higher-wage jobs.

Second, while wages of average working-class people in the U.S. have stagnated in recent decades, and economic insecurity has grown, earnings for middle- and upper-class jobs – which are dominated by educated whites – have soared.

A third and more recent finding is that working-class white men are the group that is most racially resentful and most opposed to further immigration. This finding is based on analyses of survey data of the whole U.S. population examining both voting behavior and attitudes toward blacks and immigrants, zeroing in on President Donald Trump’s core supporters and the content of his political messaging to them.

This resentment probably explains why working-class whites, particularly men, are so receptive to President Trump’s anti-immigrant and racist messages – and why he targets them.

We suspected that the reception to racist and xenophobic messages might be a reflection of a growing competition between working-class whites and minority men for increasingly insecure, low-wage jobs.

White Men Dominate The Executive Suite

In our study, we compared different racial groups’ share of specific occupations with their percentage of their state’s workforce. In other words, we wanted to see how over- or underrepresented white, black and Hispanic men were in various jobs.

In general, we found that while some white men are prospering in executive and managerial roles, there is another group of white men with very different employment experiences.

At the top end of the labor market, our data showed that in every state, white men were overrepresented in executive and managerial jobs. But this white male privilege varied substantially by state. White men got even more of the top jobs in states with larger minority populations.

Texas, where minorities make up a third of the labor force and white men slightly more at 37%, was the most extreme. White men held 85% of private-sector executive jobs, making them overrepresented in top jobs by 138%.

Other states with sizable minority populations, such as California, New Mexico and Mississippi, similarly showed white men are especially advantaged in their control of the executive suite.

We found the same, if less extreme, pattern of white male advantage in private-sector management jobs.

Working-Class Competition

The pattern shifts dramatically, however, when we look at lower-paid working-class jobs.

These include machine and factory operatives, manual laborers and service occupations. Such jobs typically require high school degrees or less and tend to pay low wages. We find that more than half of these jobs pay below the living wage target of $15 per hour.

In every state, black men were overrepresented as machine operatives, manual laborers and service workers. Hispanic men were overrepresented in machine operative and manual labor jobs in every state except Hawaii.

Working-class overrepresentation for minority men tends to be higher in states with small minority populations, such as Vermont, Maine and North Dakota.

But we wanted to get more directly at the degree to which working-class white men are competing for the same low-wage jobs as minority men. So we compared the number of black, Hispanic, Native American and Native Hawaiian men performing operative, laborer or service jobs versus white men. In all states except Hawaii, these minorities are mostly black or Hispanic or both.

We found that in almost all states, working-class white men were competing for jobs with relatively large groups of minority men. And in 20, there were more minority men in these working-class jobs than white men. This pattern was most extreme in Washington, D.C., and California, where there were more than three minority men in these jobs for every white man.

Improving Working-Class Lives

This does not mean that working-class whites have lost their entire racial advantage, but rather that it is more tenuous and exists in a context of wage stagnation and increased insecurity.

Research shows that many whites attribute being stuck in low-wage, insecure jobs to competition with minorities but are unaware of the larger trends of wage stagnation and growing insecurity for all working-class jobs.

So it is perhaps not surprising that this combination of visible competition and misplaced blame creates fertile conditions for stoking racial and immigrant resentment, particularly at a time of stagnating incomes, falling unionization and a growing lack of job security – problems that have done the most harm to the working class, regardless of race or national origin.

Perhaps it is politically simpler to encourage workers to see each other as rivals, but policy solutions that will actually make a difference need to focus on shared economic security – rather than blame games.

79,79,"May 15, 2020",The Atlantic,The People Who Profited Off the Trail of Tears,"In Unworthy Republic, Claudio Saunt, a historian at the University of Georgia, offers a damning synthesis of the federal betrayals, mass deportations, and exterminatory violence that defined the 1830s. Two of his principal arguments—that mass expulsion wasn’t inevitable and that it was a “turning point for indigenous peoples and for the United States”—are largely accepted among scholars. His third, that it was administratively “unprecedented” in American history, invites debate about longer histories of dispossession. But Saunt’s greatest contribution is to weld the narrative of deportation to new histories of capitalism that emphasize slavery’s centrality to national economic development: He follows the money, exhaustively researching company correspondence and government records to show how bankers in Boston and London financed the dirty work of dispossession in collaboration with southern speculators. The result is a haunting story of racialized cruelty and greed, which came to define a pivotal period in U.S. and indigenous history alike.

It is also a story of how—despite all the money that white people stood to make—expulsion almost didn’t happen, thanks to a storm of protest from indigenous people and the white allies they activated. And after it unfolded, the consequences lingered. As Saunt persuasively observes, we have yet to reckon with them today.

The mass deportations of the 1830s superseded an earlier federal policy of cultural assimilation and piecemeal expansion. Beginning in the 1790s, U.S. officials spread throughout eastern North America and pressured the continent’s longtime residents to change their ways: to wear pantaloons, use plows, pray to Jesus. The policy was paternalistic and pernicious, a tool of empire. But Native people strategically played along, adopting the customs of “civilization”—such as missionary schools and writing—that could help them exert their authority. Sometimes Natives and newcomers, the white families lurching in by the wagonload as the century turned, coexisted. Choctaw were “pretty good neighbors,” recalled a federal official who was grateful to share their food and buy their farm labor for a “very reasonable wage.”

Through the mid-1820s, U.S. politicians hailed this “civilization policy” as a self-evident success. Indigenous people were adapting, while the United States won partial and patchy land cessions, a process accelerated by the War of 1812. From 1800 to 1820, the United States wrested 600,000 square miles from its indigenous neighbors.

But Native Americans still controlled millions of acres east of the Mississippi, particularly in the South. In the 1820s, Creek Indians owned a fifth of present-day Alabama; Choctaw and Chickasaw, half of Mississippi. They farmed some of the world’s blackest, most fertile soil, the kind that might convert men into millionaires—especially if cultivated intensively, by workers under the lash. In fact, wealthy indigenous southerners already owned several thousand enslaved black people.","His third, that it was administratively “unprecedented” in American history, invites debate about longer histories of dispossession.

Sinatra.

Chuck Wepner (for at least one night in 1975 and then through the “Rocky” avatar).

At least some of the people that rest stops on the New Jersey Turnpike are named after.

These public figures are, or were, world-famous, and certainly had made a name for themselves outside of the Garden State, even if their growth as artists, authors, sports figures or icons was at some point nurtured in the fertile ground of the third state to enter the union. But, if either Springsteen or Sinatra, for example, wished to protect their image on the world stage or before a national audience, neither could invoke, directly or effectively, federal or international law.

That is because the right of publicity is not something protected by federal trademark or copyright law, or by compact or treaty. As Professor McCarthy has been noted (by Ahmad and Swain) to have stated, “’The right of publicity is not a kind of trademark. It is not just a species of copyright. And it is not just another kind of privacy right. It is none of these things, although it bears some family resemblance to all three.’” The right of publicity is one of those strange legal rights that depends on the law of one state or one country even if the facts used to vindicate one’s rights to publicity (or, as it is known in some places outside the United States, celebrity) are national or international in scope. The “right of publicity is a creature of state law, and its violation gives rise to a cause of action for the commercial tort of unfair competition.” ETW Corp. v. Jireh Pub., Inc., 332 F.3d 915, 928 (6th Cir. 2003). In an age where fame is often created, claimed and credited on a world wide web, one must ask whether it makes sense to define the legal rights associated with celebrity by such local standards.

One of the early US cases recognizing by name “the right of publicity” was in fact a New Jersey federal court case, Estate of Presley v. Russen, 513 F. Supp. 1339 (DNJ 1981). That case defined the right thus:

…The right of publicity is a concept which has evolved from the common law of privacy and its tort “of the appropriation, for the defendant’s benefit or advantages, of the plaintiff’s name or likeness.” The term “right of publicity” has since come to signify the right of an individual, especially a public figure or a celebrity, to control the commercial value and exploitation of his name and picture or likeness and to prevent others from unfairly appropriating this value for their commercial benefit… Although the courts in New Jersey have not [before 1981] used the term “right of publicity,” they have recognized and supported an individual’s right to prevent the unauthorized, commercial appropriation of his name or likeness.”

In fact, in so holding, the Russen court relied on a 1907 case involving Thomas Edison, Edison v. Edison Polyform Mfg. Co., 73 N.J.Eq. 136, 67 A. 392 (1907). As Professor McCarthy has noted, the law thus recognizes “the inherent right of every human being to control the commercial use of his or her identity.” So one might think that the right, well entrenched in New Jersey, is equally clear elsewhere, or everywhere, in the United States.

Think again. Though recognized in many states, the extent to which each recognizes the right of publicity is not entirely clear. For instance, in Arizona, a federal court has said it sees no reason why such a right would not be recognized, yet no state court has done so, and the state has a statute that protects the right of publicity of soldiers, without mention of civilians. Likewise, in Illinois and in Massachusetts, the common law right has been eliminated, and the right is now protected by a statute with a list of exceptions. States like North Carolina have rejected a right of publicity statute, and does not seem to recognize it at common law, according to the International Trademark Association’s 2019 survey. Fourteen other states do not, according to the same 2019 survey, recognize the right of publicity: Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont and Wyoming. And these starker disparities do not begin to capture the nuance of how standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction among the states that do recognize such claims. As one commentator has noted, “While courts in some states, such as New York, have narrowly interpreted right of publicity claims, other states have defined the rights more broadly. Decisions vary on which state’s law will apply to a publicity claim, which in turn is decided based on the particular state’s conflict of law analysis. Any analysis of a particular claim or publication should consider the specific state law that will be applied.” So it seems, at least as to a claim enforcing the right to publicity, the New York notion that “If I can make it there/I’ll make it anywhere” does not necessarily apply because there are some places that you cannot claim at all.

The variations are only more pronounced in the international arena. For instance, though the right exists in Israel, it has been noted that Israeli law in this area is unclear, both as to nature of any such right or its theoretical foundations. Likewise, despite constitutional rights to privacy and personhood, “[i]n India, there are neither adequate case laws, nor statute governing celebrity rights per se. Thus, the legal system in India, at present, is quite deficient in dealing with the modern phenomena of endorsement advertising,” according to previously noted commentators. And, though an Indian right to publicity may exist for Indian citizens, “some jurisdictions like India, deny the right of publicity to non-citizens.” The same commentators noted that United Kingdom, spurred during the pre-Brexit period to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and rulings of the court in Strasbourg, had seemed poised to gravitate toward greater recognition of publicity rights, but it is unclear where that will now go. But UK law must be confused because another commentator has starkly stated that “[t]he United Kingdom does not recognize the right of publicity,” and the International Trademark Association has also said that the right of publicity is not recognized in England and Wales “but there are a number of other legal rights which could be used to achieve a similar effect.” (Though not mentioned in the Survey, it appears that Italy too protects publicity by overlapping other rights, as noted in World Trademark Review. But what is clear is that certainly “There is no unanimous approach to the right of publicity in the countries of the EU,” as Kateryna Moskalenko notes) It has also been noted that Canada’s approach to the right of publicity is “the closest system to the United States because the Canadian provinces differ in protection offered and scope” of that right just like the separate states in the US. Further, the International Trademark Association’s 2019 survey notes that though “[t]he right of publicity is not recognized in Australia,” the right does exist, in one form or another, in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and the UAE. The survey, though helpful, only covers sixteen countries plus the fifty United States, leaving the status of the law on what it means to be world famous a little under-reported as to the other 179 countries in the world, where it may or may not exist, or may be under consideration as it had been in the Ukraine.

Given the amount of publicity these rights sometimes get, we thought perhaps international agreements may have dealt with the right to celebrity. Noting that we had in the past provided some food for thought on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), we looked first to that document to note that it does not address that right in any material way (TRIPS does not refer to publicity, celebrity or fame), though Amad and Swain try to imply otherwise. As outlined in the same article, other treaties, like the Rome Convention and the WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty, offer various protection of performers’ rights, but do not protect the right of publicity itself. This in fact excludes the right of publicity from important enforcement principles under international law:

Most importantly, the right of publicity is not mentioned in any international treaty by the WTO such as The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPs”). Thus, nations are not required to offer protection to foreign citizens. The fundamental principle of the WTO is to encourage trade without discrimination, this is known as the national treatment principle. Under this principle, nations must provide the same level of protection offered to their citizens to foreign individuals (citizens from nations signatory of the WTO). Unlike other forms of Intellectual Property, the right of publicity remains excluded from this principle. *** There is no unifying body of international law on the right of publicity. Unlike the intellectual property right of trademark, copyright and patent law, there is no international treaty or convention to address the right of publicity. Every jurisdiction treats the right of publicity differently. Thus, depending on the geographical location in which an individual resides, there are different levels of protection offered.” [Eliana Torres, The Celebrity Behind the Brand International Protection of the Right of Publicity, 6 Pace. Intell. Prop. Sports & Ent. L.F. 116 (2016)].

This situation therefore suggests that a uniform right to enforce publicity rights should be recognized in a statute embodied in TRIPS, according to Torres. But even if international recognition and uniformity is unlikely to be soon achieved, might not a US national standard be within reach? (Some of asserted that even the fragmented US standard is preferable to not recognizing the right at all, as in the UK). Certainly in an age where the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (or at least some version of it) has been adopted by 48 states and there is a federal act, the Defend Trade Secrets Act, as well, the notion of nationalizing this standard is not without precedent or purpose. As my friend Bruce Keller has noted, “considering that the technological advancements that spawn new communicative endeavors also create a strong desire to organize such endeavors within a comprehensive legislative framework,” the lack of US national or international protection of the right of publicity in any uniform way “at first seems odd.” As Keller also notes, “[o]n reflection, however,” gap filling by common law “is understandable” because “statutes have a way of lagging behind real life.”

In many ways though, it now seems time to get it in gear and make up that lag. While noting in the past that the US can be “slow to Berne,” as it were, on such international matters, some movement makes sense, whether with a federal act or a proposed uniform act for state-by-state adoption. Torres provides a good starting point on substance of such an act:

Protection of The Right of Publicity: Persona and Image Rights

In respect of the use of an individuals’ likeness for commercial use without prior consent from the individual or the individual’s successor-in-interest, the individual shall have the possibility to prevent such use of his or her persona or image. Infringement shall occur when the individual’s image or persona is used for a commercial purpose without authorization and from such use the individual is ‘readily identifiable’ when one who views the image with the naked eye can reasonably determine that it is such natural person depicted in the image. Rights in Persona and Image shall last for the lifetime of the Registrant plus a period of fifty (50) years after the death of the Registrant. Rights in Persona and Image vest in the right-holder regardless of whether such rights were commercially exploited during that individual’s lifetime by either that individual or a licensee or assignee and shall be deemed exclusive to the individual, or licensee or assignee of such rights, for the full duration of such rights as protected under this statute. The individual rights provided for in this statute are considered property rights and are freely assignable and licensable. After the death of any individual, the rights under this statute shall belong to the successor-in-interest. [Any jurisdiction adopting these provisions] shall provide limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the Persona or Image and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right-holder, such as fair use and newsworthiness.

Ideas worthy of consideration.

But, until then, we have our common law, which may always remain “more adaptable” since, as Keller explains, a “court presented with a novel set of facts can review prior case law, analyze new factual situations, and, reasoning from past precedent, apply existing legal principles to fashion a new rule governing the heretofore unanticipated set of facts facing the court.” The sets of facts around celebrity and publicity are, at this point though, no longer unanticipated, and setting a broadly applicable statutory standard makes sense.

As for being famous by New Jersey, or other states’ standards, for the time being, it will have to suffice. Which is ok, because as the Boss said when inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, we know how to stick up for ourselves, and being from New Jersey, as we pursue our fame:

is not our curse. It is our blessing. or this is what imbues us with our fighting spirit. That we may salute the world forever with the Jersey state bird, and that the fumes from our great northern industrial area to the ocean breezes of Cape May fill us with the raw hunger, the naked ambition and the desire not just to do our best, but to stick it in your face. Theory of relativity anybody? How about some electric light with your day? Or maybe a spin to the moon and back? And that is why our fellow Americans in the other 49 states know, when the announcer says “and now in this corner, from New Jersey….” they better keep their hands up and their heads down, because when that bell rings, we’re coming out swinging. God Bless the Garden State.”

And when Einstein, Edison, Aldrin, Springsteen himself, or their heirs need a little help with the legal stuff connected to protecting their fame, they will hopefully remember to express some gratitude to those of us urging such protections. As Bruce said in his Rock N Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, “Now the lawyers — gotta thank them.”","Likewise, in Illinois and in Massachusetts, the common law right has been eliminated, and the right is now protected by a statute with a list of exceptions.
Decisions vary on which state’s law will apply to a publicity claim, which in turn is decided based on the particular state’s conflict of law analysis.

Story Highlights Program, similar to one started after Hurricane Katrina, launched in 2014.

Animals sent from areas with a lot of strays to areas where there is a large demand for rescues.

Apple and about two dozen other dogs made the trip from Mississippi to New York.

Two weeks after being rescued from the streets of Starkville, Mississippi, Apple arrived in New York City on Thursday as the 100,000th homeless animal relocated by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

About 100 people cheered as a relocation van arrived in Manhattan. Apple rode north in a crate with Curry, a Chihuahua mix that was with her when she was found in Mississippi.

Apple is cute and workers doubt the brown, short-haired mutt with hints of a black mask will spend much time in her temporary home at an adoption center before finding a permanent home.

“Apple isn’t going to be around very long,” said Laura Nelson, director of relocation outreach for the nonprofit organization.

Similar to a program that rounded up and moved homeless animals after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, the relocation effort began in 2014. It sends animals from areas with lots of strays or unwanted animals to areas where there’s a large demand for rescue animals but a small supply.

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

In the West, the organization said, animals are typically relocated from Southern California to the Northwest; animals from Texas are sent as far north as the Great Lakes. A large number of animals come from the South, a fertile breeding ground for strays because of the verdant landscape and warm temperatures.

Since many communities in places like Mississippi and Alabama lack funding for programs to spay or neuter lots of animals, the relocation program frequently moves animals from there to places including New York and New England, where stray populations aren’t as large but demand for animals is huge.

Holding Apple in her lap, board member Michele Anderson of the Oktibbeha County Humane Society in Mississippi said the transportation program saves the lives of animals that otherwise could wind up being euthanized.

“Until aggressive spay and neuter programs actually make a dent in reducing the large number of unwanted and neglected animals in our community, animal relocation is the only life-saving option for many of our animals,” Anderson said.

ASPCA said 2018 was the program’s busiest year yet, moving 29,360 dogs, 10,610 cats and 344 other animals across the country to make them eligible for adoption.

Apple and about two dozen other dogs made the 1,100-mile (1,770-kilometer) trip from Mississippi to New York over two days with an overnight stop in Virginia. They rode in a truck with a cargo area that includes individual crates, a climate control system and video monitoring.

Trisha Deaton, who has been driving a relocation truck for about a year, said the trips seem like an endless cycle, with so many homeless animals in some places and so much demand for animals in others.

“I couldn’t give you an exact number, but I normally do about two a week,” she said.

After a health check in New York, Apple and the 16 other dogs in her shipment will be put up for adoption. Any of them could get new names as they move to homes with new families, and that’s fine with the workers and volunteers at the Mississippi shelter.

“We hope they get adopted quickly,” Anderson said.

83,83,"Jul 22, 2019",Washington Post,The surprising history served with a plate of biscuits and gravy,"The indulgent meal, beloved by people from all walks of life, is now ingrained in the fabric of America’s breakfast and brunch culture. But its origins were decidedly modest.

Biscuits and gravy in some form may go back as early as the Revolutionary War, but many food writers and culinary historians position its birthplace in Southern Appalachia in the late 1800s. Lumber was one of the main industries of the region, which supports the origin story that sausage gravy was also called sawmill gravy. It was the ideal cheap and calorie-dense fuel for sawmill workers lifting heavy logs all day long, and the perfect tool for making the era’s biscuits more palatable.

America’s first biscuits were much sturdier than today’s delicate specimens. Called “beaten biscuits,” they got their leavening and smooth texture from being vigorously beaten and folded, according to John Egerton in “Southern Food: At Home, On the Road, In History.” Making beaten biscuits was often the duty of enslaved cooks or domestic servants and could take well over an hour. Once the free labor was no longer technically allowed via the ratification of the 13th Amendment, the process “had come to be viewed as too burdensome,” Egerton writes. A machine invented in 1877 “not only saved beaten biscuits from extinction but actually made them smoother, prettier, and more popular than before.”

Around the same time, baking powder and soda became commercially available. Combine this with the increased availability of flour, and the South became fertile ground for a new version of the biscuit to take root, giving cornbread a run for its money as the reigning quick bread of the region.

Why did sausage gravy become their de facto companion? It was a simple matter of economics. “Biscuits with ‘country’ or ‘white’ gravy scratched together from sausage, pan drippings, flour, and milk were affordably made from the foodstuffs that were in low supply after the American Revolutionary War,” writes Heather Arndt Anderson in “Breakfast: A History.”

When it entered the culinary canon, biscuits and gravy was for the poor, working class. “Pork was always the protein of the poor,” Arndt Anderson said in an email. “Sausage releases so much fat when cooked that a roux comes together easily in the drippings.”

Yet for some, such as my own grandmother, even sausage and dairy were out of reach at times.

Born in 1928 in tiny Rondo, Ark., my grandmother and her family lived on a farm among fields of cotton and other crops. As customary for many farmers, their livelihood oscillated with the success of each harvest, resulting in either “fat” or “lean” times, as she put it. Regardless of where they found themselves on the pendulum of prosperity, biscuits were almost always on the breakfast table.

In a family of about 10, “Being the oldest daughter, it was my plight to get up and make biscuits if Mama didn’t do it,” she tells me. She would form a well in a mound of flour, baking powder and salt and add liquid to form a dough, which she kneaded, rolled out, cut and baked into the morning’s rations. Depending largely on if they had a cow that recently birthed a calf (or a generous neighbor willing to share), the liquid was either milk or water.

“It was a treat for us to have biscuits with syrup and butter,” she said. The syrup came from the sorghum on their land, and the butter depended on the availability of dairy and the time of the year. “Southern women made such an issue about baking cakes for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, they’d save the butter,” she says. In the good times, ham and occasionally rice would make an appearance. But during the lean times, breakfast consisted of just biscuits and “thick gravy” — water thickened by a brown roux of oil and flour. No sausage, and no cream.

As Sara Roahen and John T. Edge write in “The Southern Foodways Alliance Community Cookbook,” “The Southern way with gravies was born of privation. . . . And when folks are poor, folks make do. Which means folks make gravy.”

The South is home to many gravies, and virtually any of them could be served with biscuits. Appalachian food authority Ronni Lundi talks of chipped beef and gravy and tomato gravy in her cookbook “Victuals.” “The Southern Foodways Alliance Community Cookbook” includes recipes for Mississippi Chennai okra gravy, oyster gravy, Roan Mountain corn gravy, and, in what sounds like a Wonka-esque child’s fantasy, chocolate gravy.

Nicole Taylor, executive food editor at Thrillist, recalls first experiencing biscuits and gravy in her hometown of Athens, Ga., at the now-closed Katherine’s Kitchen, where her mother worked. “Biscuits were a treat,” Taylor says, and she ate them with ham steak and red-eye gravy, traditionally made from ham drippings and coffee.

Erika Council, esteemed biscuit queen and granddaughter of famous North Carolina restaurateur Mildred “Mama Dip” Council, on the other hand, says the gravy she ate with biscuits was of the sausage variety. (“North Carolina, home of Neese sausage,” she says.) Biscuits and gravy has been served over the years at her family’s revered Chapel Hill restaurant and is one of the best-selling items at her biscuit pop-ups in Atlanta. “The sausage gravy [is] . . . definitely requested often when we cater,” she says.

Though biscuits and gravy started out as a humble regional dish, its presence has spread far and wide. In addition to human migration, the invention of refrigerated tube biscuits in 1930 made biscuits and gravy easier to prepare at home. Eventually, the dish even took root on restaurant menus as far away as the Pacific Northwest. “As a staple of the poor, biscuits and gravy would never have appeared on fancy restaurant or hotel menus in Portland’s past,” Arndt Anderson wrote in an article for PDX Monthly. “By the early 1980s, though, seemingly out of nowhere, spots around town began casually advertising the B&G, as though it had always held the same breakfast menu real estate as bacon and eggs.”

AD

AD

Cookbooks soon followed suit. In “Southern Food,” published in 1987, Egerton writes about country gravy that “It is rare to find in any cookbook a recipe for this quite common and popular companion to hot biscuits,” but that is now no longer the case. “The Joy of Cooking,” which I view as the chronicle of American cooking, included a recipe in its 2006 edition.

Today, you can find it just about anywhere. With the handle @biscuits___and___gravy, George Drake Jr. has even dedicated an Instagram account to his encounters with the dish. (His favorite is from Loveless Cafe in Nashville.) “It has such a tradition, and you can have as much fun with it as you want,” said Drake, a freelance radio producer in Dayton, Ohio. That means biscuits and lamb gravy at the Greek Street Dayton food truck; fried chicken, bacon and cheese on a biscuit topped with gravy from Pine State Biscuits in Portland, Ore.; and a dish called Fantasy Island at Leo’s Diner in Omaha. The latter includes hash browns topped with biscuits and gravy, two eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, green pepper, onion and tomato. Vegetarian and vegan versions abound, too.

Like lobster in years gone by or the chopped cheese sandwich more recently, biscuits and gravy has seen a rebranding, crossing geographic and cultural boundaries.

Asked why the dish has achieved such celebrity status among its fellow breakfast options, Drake has a theory: “I think it just appeals to so many people,” he says. “Way more than just pancakes.”

84,84,"Oct 29, 2020",E&E News,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: Graves of enslaved people pose hurdle for La. chemical plant,"A lifelong resident of St. James Parish, Sharon Lavigne spent her childhood playing in and exploring the fields that surrounded her home.

The Louisiana community was rich in flora and fauna — foxes, rabbits and deer made frequent appearances — and contained enough fish, shrimp and fertile soil for her family to catch and grow their own food.

These days, Lavigne's yard is filled not with wildlife and gardens but with a string of signs protesting the newest industrial plant slated for her neighborhood: the $9.4 billion Sunshine Project, named for the bridge that spans the Mississippi River to connect the western and eastern halves of the parish.

""Fighting this facility and all these facilities is an everyday job,"" said Lavigne, who leads the faith-based environmental advocacy group RISE St. James.

""I can't rest,"" she said. ""I can't sleep.""

Lavigne lives along an 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known as ""Cancer Alley,"" a region dotted with industrial complexes that spew air pollutants such as chloroprene, a likely carcinogen, into predominantly Black communities along the waterway.

EPA data shows that residents of the region face elevated risk of cancer due to air toxics exposure. Lavigne, for one, discovered that she had autoimmune hepatitis and aluminum in her blood.

The diagnoses got her thinking about Formosa Plastics Group's planned Sunshine Project.

Formosa's complex — which would produce ingredients for products like car casings, drainage pipes and N-95 masks — would add one more facility in ""Cancer Alley"" at a time when the country is already grappling with COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus that is exacerbated by exposure to air pollution.

The virus poses a particular threat for people of color, who are more likely to have preexisting conditions and to live in polluted communities.

""Before it even gets started,"" Lavigne said of the Formosa complex, ""we need to stop it.""

Announced in 2018, the 2,400-acre project is now subject to two lawsuits backed by RISE and other groups.

The challengers oppose siting the facility smack dab in the middle of a community where Black residents are struggling to protect not only their health amid the coronavirus pandemic but also their connection to their enslaved ancestors who are believed to be buried on the Formosa site.

They have already notched some early courtroom victories.

This summer, community members gained access to the Formosa property for a ceremony on Juneteenth, the day that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865. They marked the day on a burial ground located on the site.

A month later, Formosa wrote in a settlement agreement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it would postpone some building on the site before Feb. 1, 2021. The company said last week that it now plans to hold off on construction of parts of its complex due to the pandemic (Greenwire, Oct. 21).

At the time the Formosa facility was announced, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, touted the project's potential to bring 1,200 permanent jobs to the region.

""For more than 50 years, the Sunshine Bridge has connected the River Parishes in a strategic fashion that has enabled tremendous industrial growth and thousands of new jobs along both sides of the Mississippi River in Louisiana,"" Edwards said in a 2018 statement. ""The new Sunshine Project continues that bridge into a brighter economic future for Louisiana.""

Edwards' office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Formosa's Louisiana division is working with local officials to advertise openings and train local residents ""to be in a position to complete for jobs"" with an average salary of $84,500, said Janile Parks, director of community and government relations for FG LA LLC.

""FG is committed to hiring locally,"" Parks wrote in an email, which noted that the firm held an open house in 2018 to answer questions and discuss concerns. Parks also cited the company's community development initiatives.

But the promise of jobs has lost its luster for community members who have lost friends and family to cancer. Moreover, they said, when a new plant comes, the most desirable positions tend to go to out-of-towners.

""Jobs come after a person's life,"" Lavigne said. ""We pray that God will give us jobs that won't threaten people's lives.""

She added: ""God has the last say-so, baby.""

'Evidence of a crime'

Located on the site of the Formosa complex is a fenced-off area that — to the untrained eye — appears to be just another stretch of the sugar cane plantation that formerly sat on the property.

A closer look might reveal a mound or a pile of brush marking a thatch of ground, beneath which lie the remains of the enslaved people who once worked in those fields.

Those unmarked burial sites on the Formosa property are a key element of community members' fight against the complex.

""If you're focused on physical geography and landmarks, you wouldn't necessarily say, oh, that looks significant or that's like a historic building,"" said Justin Kray, a cartographer who has been working with RISE, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade and other Formosa opponents.

""There's a whole shift in preservation communities, which has been critiqued for focusing on, 'Does a building look pretty?'"" he continued. ""We're looking at preserving communities and social heritage and places that are important.""

Parks of Formosa's Louisiana division said the company has been working to protect remains found on one location, known as the Buena Vista site. She said no evidence of burials was found at a second location, known as the Acadia site.

""It is important to note that despite assertions made by outside groups about ancestral ties to the site, no archaeologist has been able to confirm the identity, ethnicity or race of the remains discovered on FG property,"" Parks said.

A report released this year by the firm Coastal Environments Inc. indicates that the Formosa site could hold as many as seven unmarked cemeteries.

Kray said it is ""quite likely"" that the property holds the remains of more than just enslaved people, but the absence of more information on who is buried is exactly the point: Slavery and pervasive racism that has devalued Black individuals have erased family histories and obscured ancestral ties.

An unmarked grave is emblematic of the oppression, Kray said.

""This is essentially the evidence of a crime in the past,"" he said.

St. James resident Gail Leboeuf said she considers all the people buried on the plantations her ancestors.

""We're fighting to keep all our relatives' final resting place a hallowed ground,"" she said. ""And we're fighting for people on top of the ground to have decent lives and not have this particulate matter contaminating our lives and COVID hunting us down.""

Environmental justice in the courts

Filing a successful environmental justice lawsuit is no simple undertaking, but Julie Teel Simmonds said she is up for the challenge.

The Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney is part of the legal team behind a D.C. district court lawsuit that targets an Army Corps of Engineers permit allowing Formosa to carry out dredge-and-fill activities for the Sunshine Project.

Simmonds and her co-counsel are anchoring their environmental justice claims in the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.

""We have laws that look so noble and well-designed,"" Simmonds said. ""And yet whole communities can fall through the cracks.""

She said this summer's demonstrations over police brutality against Black men and women after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have put even more of a spotlight on the Formosa litigation and environmental justice.

""I don't think it's been on America's radar as much as it needs to be,"" Simmonds said.

Some state and federal officials are starting to take notice. For example, New Jersey last month enacted a law that requires state regulators to reject or condition permits based on disparate impact to communities of color.

""There is a clear trend of states taking environmental justice more seriously,"" said Beveridge & Diamond PC principal Julius Redd, who focuses his practice on how to help companies avoid the sort of litigation Formosa now faces.

While Louisiana has no such law in place, federal lawmakers have floated legislation to pave the way for stronger environmental justice challenges, and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has shown interest in underscoring those efforts if he takes the White House.

""Savvy businesses are making preparations anticipating that,"" Redd said. ""Many are seeing it as an opportunity to revise certain policies and procedures to more thoroughly consider environmental justice issues.""

The legal battle is just one element of the fight by RISE and other groups against Formosa.

The groups have organized marches to draw attention to inequities in ""Cancer Alley.""

For one demonstration in Louisiana, Simmonds drove from her home in Colorado to deliver nurdles — pea-sized microplastic pellets that a facility owned by Formosa Plastics Corp. spilled into Texas waterways, earning the company a record $50 million penalty (Greenwire, Oct. 16, 2019).

'A Plan Without People'

Their fight doesn't stop with the Formosa complex.

St. James is subject to a 2014 land use plan that slates existing residential areas in the parish's 4th and 5th districts for future industrial activity.

""If changes are not made, the St. James Parish Land Use Plan will bring massive industrial pollution to the entire parish and eliminate two of the three majority African American districts in St. James Parish within the next decade,"" according to the report ""A Plan Without People"" that Kray co-wrote with Louisiana Bucket Brigade Director Anne Rolfes.

Delays to the Formosa plant construction have offered St. James residents some glimmers of hope.

Barbara Washington, a founding member of the new advocacy group Inclusive, recalled the community's success in pushing out a proposed $1.25 billion plant by the Chinese firm Wanhua Chemical. Citing rising construction costs, the company last year pulled its application to build a 250-acre complex.

Washington said she's not completely opposed to industrial development.

""What I'm against is the fact that industry is located too close to residential areas,"" she said.

St. James resident Myrtle Felton said she mostly stays inside these days because when she stands in her yard for too long, she comes back inside and coughs, and her sinuses act up.

Felton, who is also a member of Inclusive, said that in 2014, she lost five members of her family — including her husband — in the span of three months. The grandmother of four said the air quality in her community, not to mention COVID-19, has her concerned for her own health.

She said she would like to see her grandkids reach adulthood.

""We don't need any more chemical plants,"" Felton said. ""We don't even need the ones we have.""","St. James resident Gail Leboeuf said she considers all the people buried on the plantations her ancestors.

This list is just a morsel to suggest the banquet, omitting much more than it includes.

On Aug. 29, 1920, a child was born in Kansas City to a woman named Addie Parker. This mid-continent boomtown stank of money, literally — its stockyards in the Missouri River bottoms were among the busiest on earth. The Ford Motor Co. plant — the first outside Detroit — cranked out Model Ts for a car-crazy country. Prohibition was just a rumor from some far-off land. A local cartoonist named Walt Disney was fiddling with an idea called animation. A war veteran and sometime farmer, Harry S. Truman, was running a menswear shop downtown.

Addie’s boy was called Charlie. He was musically inclined, and for that he was in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. When he was a toddler, one of the first commercial radio stations in the United States went on the air in Kansas City. In search of content, WDAF began broadcasting dance music from a local hotel. In those days of uncluttered airwaves, the house combo could be heard across the country. Named for its co-founders, the Coon-Sanders Orchestra was dubbed “the band that made radio famous.”

That marked Kansas City as a music mecca. But the real talent was found closer to Charlie’s own neighborhood, along the glittering Black broadway of Vine Street, in the dance halls where jazz could be heard nightly. Bandleaders such as Andy Kirk, Benny Moten and Oran “Hot Lips” Page developed a riffing style that swung hard and free, and after the dancing stopped, the drinking kept going to fuel jam sessions that went until dawn.

As a teenager, Charlie Parker began taking his alto saxophone to those jam sessions, where he met and played with some of the great pioneers. By then, pianist William “Count” Basie, a veteran of both Page’s Oklahoma City Blue Devils and the Benny Moten Orchestra, had formed his own band and hired Mississippi-born Lester Young to anchor his sax line on tenor. Kansas City was crawling with strong sax players, including the dean of tenor players, Coleman Hawkins (from St. Joseph, Mo.), and the lush and breathy Ben Webster (a local kid). But it was the former Blue Devils alto player Buster Smith, a natural teacher, who mentored Charlie Parker’s preternatural talent through those all-night jams.

AD

You could say that Kansas City’s Charlie Parker didn’t become the Immortal Charlie Parker — the genius known as Bird — until he left for New York City as a young man. Featured in a band lead by Earl “Fatha” Hines, Parker dazzled his Harlem contemporaries with his lightning-fast fingerings and innovative chords, the building blocks of the jazz style that came to be known as “bebop.” Although Parker’s frequent collaborator, trumpet virtuoso John “Dizzy” Gillespie, would eventually insist that this was “the same basic music” jazz artists had been playing all along, bebop struck like a lightning bolt. Bird’s impact was seismic; he split the history of America’s music in two.

But New York needed Bird at least as much as Bird needed New York. By that I mean a vital cultural capital requires a constant infusion of new ideas, and those are found most readily from outside. Cut off from the world, sealed unto its smug self, a mecca of culture inevitably stultifies, perpetuating the status quo by rewarding those who court its approval.

Today, the country runs that risk. Our artists and intellectuals tend to live in a few places and to circulate among themselves. Their worldview is, like the famous New Yorker magazine cover, limited to New York or Boston or Hollywood or Silicon Valley, with the rest of America an empty unknown. To the extent that the rest of the United States accepts this forlorn identity and retreats into populist resentment, we reinforce the alienation.

86,86,"Nov 3, 2020",IFLScience,Twitter Thread Explains How Events Millions Of Years Ago Influence US Elections Today,"A map of the US during the Cretaceous period. Ron Blakey, Colorado Plateau Geosystems/Gates et al., 2012, PLOS ONE CC BY 1.0 , Latif Nasser/Twitter

It may have escaped your notice, but today is rather important. As well as being World Sandwich Day and the 114th anniversary of the day SOS officially became the world standard distress signal, it's also the US election.

Whichever side of the partisan line you fall on, there's a fascinating thread on Twitter by Latif Nasser that is well worth your time, outlining how events during the Cretaceous period may still influence US elections today. How, you might reasonably ask? It all has to do with millions of tiny plankton and a blue streak in a sea of red.

-

In the southern states, you may have noticed that election maps tend to show it as quite, quite red, as they continue to vote Republican. However, if you zoom in closer, you'll notice a blue streak taking in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, where Republicans cannot seem to win.

-

This blue streak had gone largely unnoticed, or at least unanalyzed, until 2000, when Professor Emeritus of Geoscience and Natural and Applied Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Steve Dutch, took a closer look and noticed it aligned weirdly well with shorelines in Cretaceous maps of mainland North America.

-

-

So how could this ancient coastline possibly affect the elections taking place 66 million years later? Well, it ended up affecting modern demographics of the Southern states due to, you've probably guessed it, their history of slavery.

-

""During the Cretaceous, 139-65 million years ago, shallow seas covered much of the southern United States. These tropical waters were productive–giving rise to tiny marine plankton with carbonate skeletons which overtime accumulated into massive chalk formations,"" Steve Dutch explained in a piece for Deep Sea News back in 2012. ""The chalk, both alkaline and porous, lead to fertile and well-drained soils in a band, mirroring that ancient coastline and stretching across the now much drier South.""

The soil in this thin stretch of land became much darker and richer than soil in the surrounding regions, and the area becomes known as the ""Black Belt"". Here's where slavery comes in.

-

“The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers,"" advisor to several US presidents Booker T. Washington wrote in his autobiography Up From Slavery. ""Later and especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white.”

-

-

As for why the line only turns blue after the 1970s, Nasser writes that it was to do with voter intimidation and other prohibitive practices that kept African-Americans from voting. Despite it being illegal to deny votes to men on the grounds of “race, color or previous condition of servitude"" since 1870, and women since 1920.

""Authorities made it virtually impossible: poll taxes, literacy tests,"" Nasser explained. ""Even a pulley system that raised the ballot box out of reach of anyone not White. Not to mention intimidation and lynching.""

That began to change after the hard-fought-for Voting Rights Act signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.

-

-

-

From around the 1970s onwards, maps have shown that blue swoosh. But, Nasser warns, that's not the end of the story.

88,88,"Aug 25, 2020",Washingtonian,Stuart Stevens Is the Biggest GOP Defector Yet—and Very Different From His Pals in the Lincoln Project,"Why do liberals so guiltlessly throng to the Never Trump movement? In poring over the latest tell-all memoir, or inhaling all those ads from The Lincoln Project, one could wager that Democrats have voluntarily consumed more Republican talking points in 2020 than their entire adult lives. The reason is simple, of course: It’s exceedingly fun to watch the other side get needled. And when it comes to needling, no one does it better than the anti-Trumpers, who are piping straight into the Republican auditory cortex like Hanoi Hannah on the Mekong Delta.

The bipartisan appeal of the Never-Trump message comes from its simple principle: Trump is a perversion of the Republican Party. “Mr. Trump and his enablers have abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles,” wrote the leaders of The Lincoln Project in their founding declamation. Accordingly, this view has taken on a De Gaullian air, touting the return of the party in exile. The real Republican party is catalogued by its achievements—building highways, favoring immigrants, founding the EPA. On the other hand, Trumpers aren’t Republicans at all, but engaged in a sort of hostile occupation.

Yet by casting Trump this way—as a perversion of their ideals—the Never-Trumpers have cleaved the world neatly in half. In their tableau, there are Resisters, and there are Imposters: a war between adversarial tribes, which represent the only two kinds of Republicans left on earth.

In fact, there’s a third kind of Republican: His name is Stuart Stevens. Regarded as one of the party’s most talented political gurus—a body of work that includes steering Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012—Stevens may arguably be the Republican Party’s most prominent defector. Stevens despises Trump. He works for the Lincoln Project, too. But that is where Stevens parts company with the Never-Trump movement, and in exceptional ways.

While the Lincoln Project argues that Trump is perverting the Republican Party, Stevens doesn’t think Trump has perverted anything: Trump is the Republican Party, Stevens believes, and the Republican Party is Trump. He thinks that there is no reclaiming his former party—and thus no inspiring appeals for better angels left to bother with. Reflecting on a four-decade career in American politics, Stevens has become convinced that Trump was not an aberrant zigzag. He was fate. “I saw a lot of this stuff, but I just chose to believe that this kind of dark side was the recessive gene, not the dominant one,” he says. “I was wrong.”

Stevens has indexed this argument in a new memoir-cum-confession, out this month, with a title that accurately conveys its morose contents: It Was All a Lie.

As a memoir, It Was All a Lie is unlike anything published in the Trump era: a photo negative of the genre of self-justifying apparatchiks, which propelled writers like Cliff Sims, Anonymous and John Bolton onto the bestseller lists. Stevens isn’t out to convince readers of his heroism or the soundness of Republican principles. He’s written a history of the modern GOP from an insider’s perspective, as well as something deeply personal, often self-flagellating. It bears less resemblance with any Trump tome, and more with Thomas De Quincey’s “Confessions of an English Opium-Eater”—a memoir launched by adulations of youth and conquest, before its descent into gothic horror and pitch-black nightmares force a reckoning on its exhausted author, who must take an accounting of a long, bleak life.

In this case, Stevens’ drug of choice was winning—something he was exceedingly good at—before he watched the party transform into something that repelled him.

Stevens is disconsolate. “None of it meant anything…It was all a lie,” he writes—on page one. Page two: “It is a strange, melancholy feeling to turn sixty-five and realize that what you have spent a good portion of your life working for and toward was not only meritless but also destructive.” Then, on page three: “I refused to believe what Donald Trump proved about Republicans, about myself, could be true.” By page 4, you’re hoping someone will take Stevens’ shoelaces away.

When I called Stevens, I found him alone in the woods of Stowe, Vermont, and seemingly dying to speak to someone. He called the book a work of “sadness and self-reflection,” something he was compelled to write.

“I feel like I’m watching a friend drink themselves to death, and I don’t know what to do about it,” he said, as he described watching the candidates he’d gotten elected suddenly capitulate to Trump. His tone wasn’t the pedagogy of a teetotaler, but the profound guilt of the friend who supplied the bottle. “I was part of it! I was in the middle of it all,” he said, repeating a theme of his book. “I bear as much responsibility as anybody else.”

The book is structured as a survey of the conservative values he thinks were betrayed, from free trade to foreign policy. In that sense, it’s a typical summary of Reagan conservatism. But Stevens’ opening chapter gives pride of place to a topic rarely afforded much ink by conservative strategists: Race, which his chapter calls “the Original Republican Sin.”

Whatever denial and self-deceit that culminated with Trump begins here, Stevens argues. On his first campaign in 1978, he was taught how to divide and diminish the Black vote. His assessment of past Republican presidents is more or less unsparing, writing, “There is a direct line from the more genteel prejudice of Ronald Reagan to the white nationalism of Donald Trump.” He’s unsparing of himself, too, reflecting on how ads for Mitt Romney in 2012, which criticized the Obama administration’s welfare policy, should have triggered alarm bells. He calls the GOP “the de facto White Party of America.”

In some respects, Stevens is the opposite of a country club Republican. He grew up near Jackson, Mississippi, raised by racially liberal parents who were active in the Civil Rights movement. While he was busy climbing the ranks of Republican politics, in his private life Stevens cut a reputation as a thrill-seeking bon vivant—traveling the globe to race competitively in ski marathons and bicycle races, sampling all the Michelin restaurants of Europe, and writing several travel books and TV scripts. One profile in 2012, during his management of the Romney campaign, concluded that Stevens “doesn’t even regard matters of life and death as life-or-death,” much less campaigns—which he instead regards “as an exhilarating form of sport.”

How the dauntless sportsman turned into a crestfallen mope is the subtext of Stevens’ memoir. It largely begins with Romney’s defeat. That loss infamously prompted Republicans to write the so-called autopsy report: a dire warning that the GOP needed fundamental changes if it wished to remain competitive, which would require attracting a multi-racial and multi-generational coalition of voters. Beginning in 2015, however, Donald Trump began doing pretty much the exact opposite—prompting commentators to suggest that Trump had proved the worthlessness of the autopsy. Perhaps he had showed his shrewdness for victory, too, however cold-blooded, thus casting Romney as a feckless loser.

But Stevens thinks the autopsy report has been misunderstood: It wasn’t strictly a strategic document at all, he argues, but an ethical one. “It was written not only as a political necessity, but a moral imperative,” he said. “It said, if you’re going to be entitled to govern the greatest country on earth—this big, cacophonous, loud, noisy country—you need to be more like that, and represent it.”

But Trump did win, and once he did, “it was almost like this audible sigh of relief” for Republicans, says Stevens, who now “could take the autopsy and throw it out the window.” The new strategy doubled-down on the party’s predominantly white base, just as Trump did—scratching out a victory in 2016 with 46.1 percent of the vote (although getting a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Romney did in his loss, as Stevens likes to point out).

On the phone, Stevens’ commentary was shot through with confessional diatribes, turning a political gab fest into something that felt more like a therapy session. “I was drawn to politics because of campaigns—not because I thought there was some higher, greater good to be served by government,” he sighed, as he described his guilt for the fifth or sixth time. “I thought that was normal. I never wrestled with the totality of the consequence of it. And in retrospective, I should have.” He paused for some time. “That was a mistake.”

But a good therapist challenges their patient’s persistent negative thoughts. Was it really all a lie? Did truly none of it matter?

Stevens was adamant. “The Republican Party is against everything I thought it was for,” he said, ticking through a list: The importance of character, personal responsibility, free trade, strength against Russia, pro-legal immigration. In his view, the party had reversed on all of them. “Now we’re the anti-character-counts party. I mean, actively—that’s the official position,” he said. “We have a president… who from the White House defends a woman at the center of an international child rape ring, and wishes here well. ‘So what?’” He laughed bitterly. “With Ronald Reagan, we said words could help bring down the Berlin Wall. Now we’re like, ‘It’s just words.’”

He compared the GOP to OPEC. “The Republican party, what does it stand for? I have no idea,” he said. “It’s a cartel. Nobody asks OPEC, ‘What’s the moral purpose of OPEC?’ It’s to sell oil. What’s the moral purpose of the Republican Party? It’s to elect Republicans.” He called it “a syndicate, not an association of political beliefs.”

In at least one respect, Stevens has been vindicated. This summer, for the first time in history, the Republican Party chose not to adopt an official party platform—the complex, meticulous language that traditionally forms the two parties’ governing ideologies. Perhaps they thought a rancorous policy squabble would be a costly indulgence during a pandemic. But many see an indication that conservative politics have gone the way of Louis IX: The leader is the platform.

At the bottom of Stevens’ argument, however, isn’t how wayward his party has gone—or how lost he feels from it—but whether the Romney wing can ever surge back. He sees some hope in a small brood of East Coast governors whom Stevens helped get elected: Phil Scott in Vermont, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, and Larry Hogan, the outspoken governor of Maryland. But he doesn’t see them sailing far against the headwinds of Trump. “If that was the case, we’d see it—we’d see great clamor for a Larry Hogan to run [for president], or a Charlie Baker,” he said. “We don’t see that.”

Whereas The Lincoln Project tells of a bright future around the corner, Stevens is despondent. The party will continue to win races, of course. For a longer foreshadow of the party’s prospects, however, and especially for the presidency, Stevens looks to California—where the GOP routinely doesn’t finish second, but often third. “I think that’s the future,” he said.

“There is a market for a center-right party,” he continued, adding that “eventually, some coherent Phoenix will rise.” But not before the party can completely dispense with Trumpism, he says. And Stevens thinks that’s a long way off.

Stevens’ pessimism isn’t the only thing distinguishing him from his Never-Trump counterparts: The once-top strategist in Republican politics now says he’s a Democrat. He means this more as a spiritual designation, rather than a change of registration, and much less ratifying a progressive worldview. Still, the implications are not lost on him. “I think you have to be involved in the system in a way, which means you have to be a Republican or a Democrat. So, my decision is, I’ll support Democratic candidates,” he explained. “Until I don’t.”

Odd as it sounded, it was better than the alternative. “It seems like I’ve spent enough of my life living in a fantasy world of politics,” he told me. “I don’t mean to continue that.”

89,89,"Jul 12, 2019",Engineering News-Record,"Kaskaskia, an Illinois Island Community in the Mississippi River, Still Can't Assess Flood Damages","After three months of being submerged in flood waters, some bridges and roads are finally passable in the tiny island town of Kaskaskia, Ill., on the Mississippi River. But local officials still don't have a good idea of how much damage has been done.

As record rain fell this spring, Illinois' first capital was cut off from its neighbors in Missouri and the rest of Illinois by up to 45 ft. of water It was only in the first week of July when the roughly three dozen residents of Kaskasia, which has no stores or schools, could cross the river in their vehicles. All of Kaskaskia's bridges were underwater from April until early July and heavy rains destroyed the crops grown on the fertile island ground.

""The tops of our bridges look good,"" says Derek Klein, a commissioner in the Kaskaskia drainage and levee district. ""The water has gotten down to 35.5 ft, which is better than where we were but it really needs to get down below 30 ft for us to be able to get a good look. We'll see what happens when it gets down there.""

Klein says it would be nearly impossible to add more height to the levees that surround Kaskaskia because fill material is not readily available. Protections put in place after 1993 flooding submerged the whole island were effective this year in keeping homes and historic sites dry.

""We actually did really well at holding the water down,"" Klein says. ""We got more rain this time, over a longer period, than in '93, but our levees held, our pumps worked, we added some berms and reinforced some areas that were a problem.""

Klein said markings on the island's pumps showed the height of the water this year was lower than that of 1993, which he attributes to the new protections. The Illinois State Climatologist Office says parts of Southern Illinois have received 200 to 300% of what it considers normal rainfall this year.

Kaskaskia has been separated from the rest of the state since the Mississippi meandered around it in the 1880s. The Liberty Bell of the West, donated by Louis XV in 1741, is still at a historic site on Kaskaskia even after the capital moved to Vandalia and then Springfield.

Its population has steadily declined. The 2010 census counted 14 residents in the farming community. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker (D) has declared a state of emergency for 36 counties and Randolph, of which Kaskaskia is a part, is among them. Klein says the levee and drainage district has yet to receive any relief funds from federal or state agencies. He is planning to attend a flood relief meeting next week.

The Illinois Constitution of 1870 authorized the Illinois General Assembly, the state's bicameral legislature, to pass laws giving landowners drainage rights. Drainage and levee districts are local bodies formed for the purpose of draining, ditching, and improving land for agricultural and sanitary purposes. They are authorized to build and maintain drains and levees, to sue all necessary private land within their corporate bodies for that purpose, and to tax land within their boundaries as necessary.","After three months of being submerged in flood waters, some bridges and roads are finally passable in the tiny island town of Kaskaskia, Ill., on the Mississippi River.

90,90,"Jul 31, 2020",Facing South,Black farmers markets bring greater equity to the South's food system,"On a recent Sunday in July, a line of over 100 people social distancing and wearing masks in the muggy North Carolina heat stretched around the block waiting to get into the downtown Durham Black Farmers Market. Families with toddlers, grandparents, huddles of teens, and young adults showed up to buy fresh food and explore a new kind of farmers market. The event promoting Black farmers and Black-owned businesses in North Carolina was organized by Black August in the Park, a local group that connects people of African descent to engage in social and cultural change.

Back in 2015, Black August in the Park began hosting a family reunion-style event of the same name to build community in Durham. The organizers — Moses Ochola, Crystal Taylor, and JaNell Henry — heard from Black business owners looking for a place to sell their goods, so that same year they launched the Black Market. The Black farmers who got involved became that event's biggest fans, and the organizers soon realized how much farmers in particular needed help.

So in 2018, Black August in the Park organized the first Black Farmers Market in Durham as an annual event — one of the first of its kind in the South. This June they expanded to twice-monthly one-day events alternating between Durham and nearby Raleigh that have attracted up to 1,500 customers a day.

The Black Farmers Markets are working to ""redesign the food system,"" says co-organizer Moses Ochola, who helps his parents, Caren and Maurice Ochola, run their popular Palace International African restaurant in downtown Durham. Through community and commerce, he and the other organizers hope to give Black farmers — dramatically underrepresented in traditional farmers markets — a space that celebrates them.

While Black farmers have been selling their produce directly to customers as long as they've been farming, farmers markets explicitly devoted to Black farmers and vendors under the title ""Black Farmers Market"" first appeared in news reports in the early 1990s in Chicago, according to an archive search by Facing South. The first was organized in July 1990 by Rev. Al Sampson, who worked with Black farmers in North Carolina and other Southern states to bring what he called ""soul food"" to be sold in the city, according to the Chicago Tribune. A similar model was established in Baltimore in 1996, also importing produce from the South, and others sprouted up in Indianapolis and Oakland, California. The first Black farmers market in the South was held in Atlanta in 1997. Since then, there have been a handful of others in Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.

""Black farmers have systematically been left out of a lot of programs and initiatives to help them, and have been losing their land at a tremendous and alarming rate,"" says Ochola. The Black Farmers Market is an attempt to ""bring them back into the fold … so that we can not only help the farmers but help rethink food sovereignty in our Black communities.""

Resisting dispossession

In 1920, Black farmers in the U.S. owned 41.4 million acres of land. But since then, white-supremacist terrorism and systematic racism by banks and government institutions like the Farm Security Administration and USDA have worked together to dispossess Black families of their land. Over the past century, Black people in the U.S. have collectively experienced a loss of 90% of the farmland they once owned.

""We need to understand that the entire agricultural system in the U.S. is built on the exploitation of Black and brown people,"" says Erin White of the Community Food Lab, a group based in Raleigh, North Carolina, that works to design a more equitable food system. Due to consumers' disengagement from the food system, he adds, ""we are allowing other interests to build the food system that works for them, and we end up with a food system that doesn't support human health, doesn't support racial equity, doesn't support sustainable land use, or climate responsibility.""

Black organizers in the South have long focused on the food system as a path to economic freedom for the Black community. In 1969, for example, the Mississippi voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer started the Freedom Farm Cooperative that purchased prime Delta land and grew cash crops like soybeans and cotton to pay taxes and administrative expenses, and vegetables that were distributed back to co-op members who included Black agricultural workers fired from other jobs because of their civil rights activism. Around the same time, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund based in Georgia began working to keep Black farmers on their land through collective ownership. And in 1995, the National Black Farmers Association was formed in Virginia to advocate for the rights of Black farmers; it played a key role in winning a $2 billion settlement in the class action lawsuit Pigford v. Glickman that alleged racial discrimination by the USDA in providing loans and other assistance.

But as White observes, the recent movement in the U.S. to promote healthier and more sustainable eating by supporting local farmers markets among other things was overwhelmingly white. So though there has been a boom in farmers markets in recent years — they grew by 76% from 2008 to 2014, and another 6% since then, according to the USDA — they typically serve affluent white populations and too often have erected barriers that discourage farmers and other vendors of color.

The Community Food Lab is conducting a comprehensive survey to dig deeper into issues around racial equity in North Carolina farmers markets. But based on initial responses, at least a quarter of the state's markets report having no vendors of color at all, White says. Getting into a farmers market can be a competitive and expensive process, and once someone is accepted there are often rules that make it hard to stay.

""When they have restrictions on what they can sell, what they can't sell, and things of that nature, it makes it hard for farmers that don't have all the resources and opportunities that white farmers have,"" says co-organizer Crystal Taylor of Black August in the Park and the Black Farmers Market.

White-dominated markets can also be a flat-out unwelcoming space for black vendors. ""I mean, it's a traditional setting, you know, is a nice way to put it,"" says Samantha Foxx of Mother's Finest Urban Farms in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""I've had people who come by me, and I'm like, 'Hey, how are you doing?' And they don't even look my way. Even if we have the best things to offer, they don't even want to consider what we have."" Foxx now tries to use her presence to change these markets, but showing up was not always easy. ""I felt like they pushed us out,"" she says.

One prominent farmers market recently faced public criticism for its treatment of Black farmers. Freshfarm, the farmers market system in Washington, D.C., came under fire after promoting Black vendors in their network in response to the police killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed. One of those vendors, Toyin Alli of the food booth Puddin', spoke up about how her experiences did not align with the organization's claims of being anti-racist. She told Forbes she had been repeatedly denied a spot in its most profitable market at Dupont Circle with no justification, and she said Black vendors account for just a tiny fraction of all vendors within Freshfarm's network. In response to Alli's advocacy, the organization added more Black vendors.

The organizers of the Durham Black Farmers Market say their work is all about building networks and connections to Black farmers — especially since the intentional outreach needed to create true equity in traditional farmers markets isn't happening.

""We've realized that Black farmers are not being tapped,"" says Ochola. ""So, much of our work is communicating and trying to get farmers to be a part of it.""

'Something I could call my own'

The Durham Black Farmers Market is just the latest innovation in a rich and growing ecosystem of food-justice organizations and projects in North Carolina's Triangle region, long a center of cutting-edge scholarship around agriculture given that N.C. State, the public land-grant research university known for its agriculture programs, is located in the capital city of Raleigh.

The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) — a partnership of N.C. State; N.C. A&T, a historically Black university in Greensboro; and the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services — is one of the South's most important centers for research and education in sustainable agriculture and community-based food systems. CEFS has worked with the Community Food Lab and other local groups on an initiative to connect downtown neighborhoods through food.

Raleigh is home to the vast North Carolina State Farmers Market, which is open seven days a week. But even before the Black Farmers Market began serving the city, there were other smaller farmers markets taking place there. One is operated by the Fertile Ground Food Cooperative, which is planning to open a brick-and-mortar store in the historically Black community of Southeast Raleigh, where some neighborhoods have been designated so-called ""food deserts"" where quality food is hard to come by. In the meantime, the co-op launched a regular farmers market in 2016.

Janet Howard, Fertile Ground's project manager, sees a benefit to farmers markets beyond being a place to buy fresh, local food. ""It reinforces to our community and to young people that this is an opportunity for you to not only see and purchase, but consider agriculture,"" she says.

Such efforts appear to be paying off. After a century of decline, the number of Black farmers in the U.S. is growing again. The 2017 Census of Agriculture reported just over 32,000 Black farmers representing 1.6 percent of the nation's agricultural producers — double the share in 1997. Black-owned acreage was also up to 3.9 million acres compared to the low point of 2.3 million in 1992.

This new group of Black farmers include people like Kamal Bell. The former public school teacher founded Sankofa Farms in Orange County, North Carolina, not far from Durham, to help people affected by food deserts. The farm also provides educational opportunities for Durham youth. Bell said he had many visions for what the farm would be, but what ultimately led him to buy the land was simple.

""The first thing was just so I could have something I could call my own,"" Bell says. ""Because if I want to eat food, I'm not going to sit back and always go to white people for resources.""","Through community and commerce, he and the other organizers hope to give Black farmers — dramatically underrepresented in traditional farmers markets — a space that celebrates them.
Due to consumers' disengagement from the food system, he adds, ""we are allowing other interests to build the food system that works for them, and we end up with a food system that doesn't support human health, doesn't support racial equity, doesn't support sustainable land use, or climate responsibility.""

91,91,"Mar 7, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Doors to Vicksburg - The Vicksburg Post,"“T he story of Vicksburg is laced together by the river that birthed her,” writes Virginia Calohan Harrell in her book, “Vicksburg and the River.”

Located on top of a high bluff on the east bank of the Mississippi River, Vicksburg’s earliest settlers, even its founder the Rev. Newit Vick, came to the city by way of the river since roads were either nonexistent or impassable.

Although the area’s first inhabitants were the Native Americans, Harrell writes, others eventually arrived in the city of rolling hills and fertile soil.

Those who came included the French, Spanish, English, Scottish, Irish, Germans, Italians, Swiss, Jewish, Russians and Chinese.

The diversity expanded when African Americans were brought to Vicksburg.

Christopher Morris writes in his book, “Becoming Southern: The Evolution of a Way of Life Warren County and Vicksburg Mississippi, 1770-1860” that from 1775 to 1795, a steady stream of migrants from England’s Atlantic colonies made their way to the River City and brought with them their slaves.

This is us, a city that is a virtual melting pot of faces and cultures and traditions. And all this can be discovered behind the doors of a community that is smart, strong and spirited.

Even during the Civil War when the city endured a 47-day siege, the city’s residents remained proud and resilient.

Dubbed the Red Carpet City of the South, Vicksburg welcomes visitors and celebrates those who live here.

Martha Vick Home

The Martha Vick Home (c.1830) is located at 1300 Grove St. and was built by Vicksburg founder Newit Vick. Built in the Greek Revival style, the one-story façade was constructed for Martha Vick, one of Newit Vick’s 13 children. It is the last original Vick home remaining in Vicksburg.

Jewish Temple — Anshe Chesed congregation

Jews began arriving in Vicksburg before the town was even incorporated and by 1825 when the city was officially incorporated, the Jewish population numbered around 20 families. These early settlers, and those who followed, came mainly from the Germanic lands of central and Western Europe fleeing political and religious persecution and seeking new economic opportunities. Mostly peddlers by trade, Jewish merchants established themselves in Vicksburg, an area reminiscent of their homes along the Rhine, and contributed greatly to the area’s importance as a leading trading and commercial center on the Mississippi River. As their community grew, the Jews eventually formed the Anshe Chesed congregation and in 1870 dedicated their first synagogue, which was located on Cherry Street. A final wave of Jewish immigrants moved to Vicksburg in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and formed their own Orthodox congregation, but soon merged with the long-standing Anshe Chesed Reform congregation. The congregation decided to move in the late 1960s and built a smaller temple on Baldwin’s Ferry Road. The Anshe Chesed congregation is one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the state of Mississippi, and for more than 165 years, it has been at the center of Vicksburg’s Jewish community.

Old Court House Museum-Eva W. Davis Memorial

The museum is located at 1008 Cherry St. and was constructed by skilled slave labor between 1858 and 1860. It is Vicksburg’s most historic structure. The Court House played host to many famous guests and speakers including Jefferson Davis, Ulysses S. Grant, Booker T. Washington, Teddy Roosevelt and William McKinley. Today it houses many relics of the past including fine portraits, china, silver, antique furniture, antebellum clothing, Native American and pioneer implements, plus an original Teddy Bear.

Shirley House — Vicksburg National Military Park

The Shirley House was owned by James and Adeline Shirley and is the only wartime structure remaining inside the Vicksburg National Military Park. On May 18, 1863, as the Confederate rear guard fell back into the Vicksburg defenses, soldiers were ordered to burn all the houses in front of their works. The Shirley barns and outbuildings were quickly burned to the ground, but the soldier assigned to destroy the house was shot before he could apply the torch. The VNMP commemorates one of the most decisive Civil War battles, the campaign, siege, and defense of Vicksburg. In addition to the Shirley House, the park includes 1,325 historic monuments, 20 miles of reconstructed trenches and earthworks, a 16-mile tour road, 144 emplaced cannons, the restored Union gunboat-USS Cairo and the Vicksburg National Cemetery.

McRaven

McRaven is located at 1445 Harrison St. and the house spans three different time periods. Andrew Glass built the oldest section of the home, also referred to as the “pioneer section,” in 1797. Walls made from blueberry and buttermilk plaster still remain in the structure. Glass built the two-room brick structure with a bedroom above a kitchen. The home also had a removable ladder so Glass could get to the upper level and prevent an ambush while he slept. McRaven has been named Mississippi’s Most Haunted House and some think the hauntings began with Glass’ surprising death. He would rob people traveling the Natchez Trace and hide out in McRaven.

St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church

St. George was one of the first Orthodox churches in the southern part of the United States and has played an important role in the lives of many Orthodox faithful, including Lebanese, Syrian, Greek, Russian and Serbian nationalities.

St. George was established in 1906, and in 1910 purchased the old Gibson Memorial Church and transformed it into an Orthodox temple. In January 1967, the congregation moved into a newly constructed facility at 2709 Washington St. In 2006, the church celebrated its 100th anniversary. St. George is the oldest Antiochian Orthodox Church in Mississippi and the South.

U.S. Army Corps Of Engineers — ERDC

The Waterways Experiment Station, also known, as WES-Original Cantonment, is comprised of a 673-acre tract of land. The original complex was built in 1930 as a United States Army Corps of Engineers research facility. Its campus is the site of the headquarters of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers- Engineer Research and Development Center. WES is the largest of the four Corps of Engineers’ research and development laboratories. The facility was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2000 in part for its architecture. ERDC helps solve the nation’s most challenging problems in civil and military engineering, geospatial sciences, water resources, and environmental sciences for the Army, Department of Defense, civilian agencies, and the Nation’s public good. Its vision is to become the world’s premier public engineering and environmental sciences research and development organization.

Magnolia Avenue High School

Located on Bowman Street,Magnolia Avenue High School was at one time the only black secondary school in Vicksburg, and its curricular program balanced academics-college preparatory classes with a vocational course of study. In 1940, Magnolia Avenue was considered one of the 16 most important black high schools in the southeast, and was chosen to participate in a study funded by the Rockefeller Foundation’s Center.The school’s name was eventually changed to Bowman High school in honor of long-time principal J.G.H. Bowman.

Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum

In 1890, Joe Biedenharn and his father Herman built a two-story brick building at 1107 Washington St., which served as Joe’s wholesale candy company on one side and his father’s shoe store on the other. It was here that the Biedenharns bottled the first Coca-Cola until the new Coca-Cola plant was constructed at 2133 Washington St. in 1938.

Strand Theatre

Vicksburg once had as many as four downtown theaters, and among them was the Strand Theatre, located in the Adolph Rose Building, 717 Clay Street. A prominent local merchant, Adolph Rose, built the Victorian Romanesque building about 1890 for his goods company, and at the time it did not contain a theater. Around 1930, it was sold to Feld Furniture. The ground floor was renovated to house two long, thin commercial establishments, a store on the left and the theater on the right. The theater operated from 1932 to 1963, first as Paramount-Richards then Paramount-Gulf Theatres and finally by Gulf States Theatres. The Strand Theatre is now home to the Westside Theatre Foundation, which offers live theatre, films and concerts.

92,92,"Dec 7, 2020",vtdigger.org,"Daniel Felde: When the vaccine arrives, Vermont must prioritize incarcerated people","Share Email 294 Shares

Editor’s note: This commentary is by Daniel Felde, of Burlington, who is a senior at the University of Vermont studying political science.

With the first coronavirus vaccines set to arrive soon, Vermonters may be envisioning freedom. To some, freedom is a future of nightlife, dinner with friends, “normalcy.” To others, freedom is the promise of any future at all. As the vaccine is rolled out to the most vulnerable populations first, Vermont must prioritize the least free: people in prisons.

Throughout the U.S., prisons have been Covid hotspots. In fact, the five largest outbreaks in the country have been in prisons, not meatpacking plants or nursing homes. Three months ago, 185 (84%) of the 219 Vermonters incarcerated at a prison in Mississippi contracted Covid-19. A national study in August found that Vermont had the highest prison to state ratio of Covid cases out of any state. As the number of cases in Vermont surges, the 1,726 people detained and incarcerated by Vermont face an increasingly higher risk of contracting Covid. Once infected, the high rates of heart and lung conditions, mental illness, and substance use disorder among the prison population make the virus especially deadly. On average, the mortality rate is twice as high for people in prison than the general population after adjusting for sex, age, and race. Black people, who are at a heightened risk of both contracting and dying from Covid, constitute 9.5% of the prison population but only 1.4% of the state population. Vaccinating Vermonters in prison is therefore a major racial justice issue.

Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.

It is crucial that prioritizing incarcerated people includes Vermonters held in Mississippi. Vermont’s out-of-state contractor CoreCivic has not always been in lockstep with Vermont Department of Corrections policies. In April, the Vermont Prisoners’ Rights Office had to file a lawsuit against the DOC to push for additional Covid protection measures in the Mississippi facility. Keep in mind this was before the August outbreak. Clearly, it wasn’t enough.

The Vermont Department of Health will be looking to recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on how to identify priority groups to vaccinate. However, the ACIP prioritizes correctional officers (classified as essential workers), not incarcerated people in their phase I recommendations. If people experiencing incarceration are not included in the first phase of vaccinations, they may have to wait months for their turn.

It is no surprise that incarcerated people have been forgotten; prisons are institutions of societal amnesia and neglect. Once extracted from their communities, people incarcerated by Vermont have been sexually assaulted and denied medical care. Isolation in prison presents a dichotomy. Contact with outside family members and friends remains restricted: in-person visitations are off-limits and people are allowed two five-minute phone calls a week in addition to a weekly 25-minute video visitation. However, social contact within the prison is abundant, and shared living and eating spaces provide fertile ground for Covid to spread. The solution here is not months of increased social isolation, it is a vaccine.

If the Department of Corrections truly believes in the “inherent worth and dignity of all individuals,” it must fight for the vaccination of those it has incarcerated. If the Department of Health wants to pursue its mission to “protect and promote the best health for all Vermonters,” it must prioritize incarcerated people along with health care workers and those in long-term care facilities. Not only would this protect the health of incarcerated individuals but also, by preventing mass outbreaks, Vermont as a whole. If testing was the answer, then why won’t they simply be testing more in nursing homes during phase I? Because vaccines are the best technology we have to prevent the ravages of this virus. Our vaccination priorities show how we value life. I’m certainly looking forward to having my social circle vaccinated, but we must not forget people experiencing incarceration. They are parents, siblings, children, and friends too.","As the vaccine is rolled out to the most vulnerable populations first, Vermont must prioritize the least free: people in prisons.

93,93,"Jan 13, 2020",,‘The recruiting base here is hard to resist’: How Mike Leach will attack recruiting at Mississippi State,"STARKVILLE — The Pirate has arrived.

Following Friday’s introductory press conference — an over 35-minute session of laughs, offensive philosophies, and more laughs — Mike Leach has already made his mark on the MSU football program.

But with the opening pleasantries that come with a new coaching hire behind him, Leach’s immediate responsibilities involve filling out his coaching staff — something athletic director John Cohen has afforded him $4.7 million to do. But perhaps as pressing, it’s nearly time to turn the recruiting calendar toward the 2021 class.

For all the excitement Leach’s arrival has brought over the past four days — including the hopes of a high-flying passing attack led by quarterback Garrett Shrader, who was among the players that met the new head coach at George M. Bryan Airport Thursday — it remains to be seen how the former Washington State head coach will recruit in Starkville.

Speaking before a crowd of roughly 500 fans at the Leo Seal Jr. Football Complex Friday, Leach made note of how the recruiting base in Mississippi and the surrounding states was a major pull for the job.

“I’ve always wanted a quality place where people are committed to winning,” he said. “Just to be perfectly honest, the recruiting base here is hard to resist. A 300-mile radius of here just has outstanding recruits, and it all starts with the commitment on the high school level and the great job the high school coaches do here.”

Opening sentiments aside, Leach’s Washington State teams rarely, if-ever, recruited at an elite level. Over his eight seasons in Pullman, Leach never signed a recruiting class ranked higher than 42nd nationally in the 247 Sports Composite Rankings.

Further, only the 2018 class at Washington State included multiple four-star recruits (2), while the Cougars never signed three or more such prospects in a single year over that same span.

Conversely, Joe Moorhead signed three-straight top-25 classes during his two-plus year run at MSU — including the 22 recruits in the class of 2020 that inked with MSU during the Early Signing Period in December.

And while Leach has had limited recruiting success in the rankings, Mississippi’s fertile recruiting ground should provide a natural boost.

For context, 11 players from the Magnolia State rank in 247 Sports’ top 500 prospects for the class of 2020 compared to just seven players from the state of Washington. Additionally, eight of the top 20 prospects in Mississippi are committed or have signed with the Bulldogs, while Washington State’s 2020 class included just one of the top 20 players in the state.

“They’ve done a fine job recruiting here over the years,” Leach said. “There’s a lot of things we’re going to have to maintain and continue and then elevate as we see opportunities.”

Beyond the high school ranks, Mississippi also provides the added bonus of some of the nation’s highest rated junior college recruits — something Leach has already reaped the benefits of in the form of current Jacksonville Jaguar and former Northwest Mississippi Community College and Washington St. quarterback Gardner Minshew.

“I think that definitely helps and also a guy you like out of high school you have the ability to get him on track,” Leach said of the Mississippi junior college system. “I think the best teams — the majority come out of high school and I think it’s important for the core of your teams to be high school guys. But I’ve had some great luck with junior college guys.”

With Leach now focused on filling out his staff, he said Friday he expects to bring in recruiters familiar with the state and MSU’s recruiting footprint. Once on board, those staffers should quickly turn their attention to the 2021 class and the final few spots of the 2020 group. And though the 2021 class remains roughly a year from signing on to Leach’s squad, the new head coach is excited for his new staff to take advantage of the recruiting profile MSU affords.

“First and foremost, I want good, quality people who are dedicated recruiters and then a mixture,” Leach said of what he’ll look for in his recruiting staff. “We’ve got to have really strong guys who know X’s and O’s on the field, discipline, focus, and pulls the unit together. The most important thing is what you can do together.”","“Just to be perfectly honest, the recruiting base here is hard to resist.

94,94,"Mar 23, 2019",The Commercial Dispatch,Ask Rufus: Was Kubla Khan’s Sacred River the Tombigbee?,"Connections are always interesting. With the recent blooming of daffodils and jonquils I could not help but think of one of my favorite poems:

“I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o’er vales and hills

When all at once I saw a crowd

A host of golden daffodils

Beside the lake, beneath the trees

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.”

William Wordsworth wrote those lines in about 1804 and the poem “I wandered lonely as a Cloud” was first published in 1807. The May 4, 1839, New Yorker published the poem with an interesting twist: it credited “Louisa Ann Twamley” as the poet.

In an interesting local connection, the mid to late 1830s Mississippi agent for The New Yorker was Henry Gibson, whose address was given as Choctaw Agency, Mississippi. The Choctaw Agency at that time was southeast of present day Starkville. Gibson was John Pitchlynn’s son-in-law and had purchased the farm of Yo Ka Tubbe, a Choctaw who was living near present day Artesia. During the Creek Indian War of 1813-1814, Yo Ka Tubbe’s house had served as a safe house for the Pitchlynn children when Creek warriors threatened Pitchlynn’s fort at Plymouth Bluff.

When one thinks of famous poems with a Mississippi or Alabama connection, Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s classic poem “Kubla Khan” immediately comes to mind:

“In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

A stately pleasure-dome decree:

Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

Through caverns measureless to man

Down to a sunless sea.

So twice five miles of fertile ground

With walls and towers were girdled round;

And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,

Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;

And here were forests ancient as the hills,

Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.”

Few people realize that some of the landscapes, flowers and plants described in Coleridge’s masterpieces, “Kubla Khan” and “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” and in Wordsworth’s poem “Ruth” are actually places in Florida and the rivers and forests of the Mobile/Alabama/Tombigbee River valley.

That part of the story begins with William Bartram, who in March of 1773, began a four-year trek that would carry him across Georgia, through Florida and across present day Alabama and Mississippi to New Orleans. Of great interest to Bartram were limestone caverns and associated springs in Florida in which water rose up like a fountain and flowed into the St. Johns River and the flowers, plants, forest and rivers of what is central and south Alabama.

In 1791 Bartram published a book of his journey, “Travels Through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, Etc.” The book included vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape. It is still considered a classic account of the natural history of the early American South and is still in print, simply called “Bartram’s Travels.”

As Bartram traveled across the American Southeast he collected specimens and made drawing of the fauna and flora that he encountered. During his journey he described 358 plants and trees. He collected many specimens or made drawings of others which he sent to London. Today the Natural History division of the British Museum has 247 botanical specimens collected by Bartram during his travels.

Bartram’s book of his travels included descriptions and drawings of many plants, including the Oak Leaf Hydrangea which he discovered along the Alabama River. Of the plants described by him I recognized several that are still common in Mississippi and Alabama. Among those local flowers he described in the 1770s are the Primrose, Oak Leaf Hydrangea, Celestial Lily, Climbing Aster, Flaming Azalea, St John’s Wort, Hooded Pitcher Plant, Lupine, several Rhododendrons, Mountain Camellia, Purple Milkweed, Spider Lilly, Savannah Pink, Sebastian Bush, Pawpaw, Spider Flower, Yucca and Yaupon Holly.

He also described finding the Alabama/Mobile River valley landscape to be “a magnificent and pleasing sylvan landscape of primitive, uncultivated nature. Crossed several very considerable creeks, their serpentine courses being directed across the plain by gently swelling knolls perceptible at a distance but which seem to vanish and disappear as we come upon them.”

The renown British poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth obtained copies of “Bartram’s Travels” and became interested in the new country of America. Both pulled many images of the American Southeast from the book which they incorporated into their poems. This is especially evident throughout Coleridge’s masterpiece “Kubla Khan” which he was said to have written after reading Bartram’s book. In one example Bartram had described the lower Alabama/Tombigbee/Mobile river system as “a serpentine rivulet meandering over the meadows.” In “Kubla Khan” Coleridge wrote:

“Five miles meandering with a mazy motion

Through wood and dale the sacred river ran”

In another example Bartram had written: “The evening cool, we encamped on the banks of a glittering rivulet amid a spicy grove of Illicium Floridanum.” These spicy groves were found in “…detached groves, contrasted by swelling ridges and vales supporting grand forests of trees.” (The tree was the anise tree whose leaves have a sweet smell but whose flowers when ripe have a fishy odor. The tree is found along the Gulf Coastal Plain and within the Black Prairie.)

In Kubla Khan Coleridge wrote:

“Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;

And here were forests ancient as the hills,

Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.”

Such similarities with the book occur throughout the poem and in such number it would not be a coincidence. Who would have ever thought that many of the images in “Kubla Khan” and other masterpieces of British poetry are taken from descriptions of a 1770s journey from Florida across Alabama and Mississippi to New Orleans?","The May 4, 1839, New Yorker published the poem with an interesting twist: it credited “Louisa Ann Twamley” as the poet.

95,95,"Sep 25, 2020",American Songwriter,"Squirrel Nut Zippers Continues to Share Joy, Happiness on ‘Lost Songs of Doc Souchon’","Squirrel Nut Zippers leader Jimbo Mathus calls as he’s driving through Tupelo, Mississippi. “The whole region here is quite historic,” he says. Tupelo is, of course, where Elvis Presley was, born and lived in his childhood. For a musician, then, this area is fertile ground, and Mathus clearly appreciates that.

Mathus has been paying homage to his musical forerunners since he founded Squirrel Nut Zippers in 1993. The Zippers, as they’re affectionately nicknamed, are beloved for their fun-loving take on swing, jazz, and blues music. This pattern continues with their latest album, Lost Songs of Doc Souchon (set for release on September 25), which includes original Zippers material alongside covers of early New Orleans jazz songs. “I think the music will bring a lot of joy and happiness. That’s a huge component of what we do,” Mathus says.

The inspiration for this new album came to Mathus last year. “I did a residency in New Orleans for two months last spring and I played all the clubs. I’d had a revival band, they’re all New Orleans cats, and I wanted to go down there and just be with them and just immerse myself in their world.” While there, Mathus says, “I started thinking back to my Doc Souchon record – these songs that go way back yonder.”

Souchon, born in 1897, was a celebrated jazz guitarist. He was also, Mathus says, “a folklorist and early proponent of keeping the roots of New Orleans jazz alive. He made a boutique record back in the 1960s. He was quite old then. He grew up in the twenties, thirties, and saw and was enthused by the music, so he preserved this in this record. Very obscure.” From this starting point, Mathus says the concept for the next Zippers album started coming together.

Mathus learned how to play some of the songs on that Souchon record, such as “Cookie” (by New Orleans Willie Jackson) and “Animule Ball” (of unknown origination). Both of those tracks appear on Lost Songs of Doc Souchon, as well as several other early songs. Mathus kept that material in mind, “sort of template songs,” as he wrote three original tracks for the album.

Some of the material came from much earlier seeds of ideas, though. Mathus, who was raised in Mississippi, founded Squirrel Nut Zippers after moving to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1993. Around that time, he says, he recalls picking up religious tracts when he’d go to the laundromat. “They’re little pamphlets that Christian groups put out about the horrors of alcohol or the impending everlasting punishment of hell. They have little graphics on them, too, that can be quite surreal. One of the tracts stuck with me all these years: ‘Time’s passing like a train on fire, so you’d better get your house in order.’” From that, Mathus was able to write the song “Train on Fire.”

Mathus doesn’t mind taking this long to complete a song. “I’m very patient with my songs,” he says. “If I have a great idea and don’t have a great song, I’ll wait until it hits me. If it’s not coming naturally, I just leave it alone.”

Mathus admits that it wasn’t initially evident that he’d ever become a songwriter at all, though. He started out in a band that only played alternative music cover songs. When someone suggested he write his own material instead, “I thought, ‘Oh yeah, that’s how you get songs – you write them!’” But, not knowing how to proceed, he didn’t immediately act on this advice.

Finally, “One day, this song just overtook my imagination,” Mathus says. “I was driving out in the country and I didn’t know what was happening. I genuinely thought that maybe I was going insane. These thoughts were permeating my mind and these words were coming out. Very odd.” Mathus pulled into a gas station and borrowed a pen and some paper so he could scribble down what he was hearing in his head. “At that point, I knew, ‘That’s what writing a song is!’”

Mathus can’t remember much about that particular song now (“It’s not anything I ever recorded – it was so early on in the process”), but it was the catalyst he needed to start learning how to become a songwriter. As he worked, he realized that rock music was not what he actually wanted to do at all – he was far more interested in what had come before that.

“I started really understanding that everything comes from somewhere,” Mathus says. “Like, you can listen to something like the Rolling Stones – where did that come from? Well, that came from Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. Okay, where did that come from? So I started following the trail backwards, to understand what it was that songs were doing and where they came from.”

In the 1990s, at the peak of the grunge era, this was certainly an unusual approach to songwriting. Mathus formed Squirrel Nut Zippers to help him realize this unique vision, and they released their debut album, The Inevitable, in 1995, but it didn’t initially get much attention. By the time they released their second album, Hot, in 1996, the world was ready for their retro swing sound, and the album achieved platinum status. By 2000, they had put out three more releases, with three million album sales.

After their 2000 album, Bedlam Ballroom, the Zippers went on hiatus, and Mathus moved back to Mississippi and began a solo career, releasing numerous albums (available at his Bandcamp page: https://jimbomathus.bandcamp.com/). He also toured and recorded with Buddy Guy. He opened his own studio, where the likes of Elvis Costello recorded. But in 2013, realizing that interest in the Squirrel Nut Zippers was renewed because of the twentieth anniversary of their Hot album, he reformed the band and resumed playing shows. In 2018, they released the well-received album Beasts of Burgundy.

Mathus believes that the Squirrel Nut Zippers continue to interest people because “it’s just so unique, it’s so fun. To me, an entertainer needs to be exuberant. He needs to be outgoing. He needs to be fun. You can sit there and strum your song. That’s fine; people do that. But I wanted more of a spectacle. We’re not here to satisfy or gratify ourselves. We get gratified when we see the faces light up, when we see the joy, the manic dancing and frenzied conga lines. That makes me know, okay, I’m doing my job.”

And it’s a job that Mathus plans to do for the rest of his days. “It’s my life’s work: I’m a journeyman musician,” he says. “I’m not a flash-in-the-pan dude. I’m here for the long haul. I get a lot of inspiration for that from the jazz cats and blues guys that started early and performed their entire life – there’s no shelf life on that. That’s the cat I wanted to be. And that’s the cat I’ve turned into.”","Squirrel Nut Zippers leader Jimbo Mathus calls as he’s driving through Tupelo, Mississippi.
Mathus has been paying homage to his musical forerunners since he founded Squirrel Nut Zippers in 1993.
Very obscure.” From this starting point, Mathus says the concept for the next Zippers album started coming together.
Mathus, who was raised in Mississippi, founded Squirrel Nut Zippers after moving to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1993.
Mathus believes that the Squirrel Nut Zippers continue to interest people because “it’s just so unique, it’s so fun."

MSU Students Recognized for Gardening Project

Mississippi State University students studying landscape architecture, architecture and graphic design recently took part in a program to conceptualize a suite of garden designs aimed at helping schools build learning gardens.

The project, called ""The Living Room: A Freeware Learning Garden Focused on Health, Food and Nutrition Education,"" received an Honor Award for student collaboration at the American Society of Landscape Architects.

MSU's consortium included 10 landscape architecture students, 10 architecture students and one graphic design student. ASLA recognized the MSU students for their efforts at the society’s recent virtual conference. The project also appeared in “Design-Build: Integrating Craft, Service, and Research through Applied Academic Practice,” a textbook by University of Washington Landscape Architecture professor Daniel Winterbottom.

The MSU students produced two proof-of-concept designs, one of which is already in place at Galloway Elementary School in Jackson and another which is scheduled for installation at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU in spring 2021.

MSU's students collaborated on the gardens with The Fertile Ground Project, a Jackson-based program about food access; JH&H Architects in Flowood; Pikus Concrete in Utah and Significant Developments in Pennsylvania.

97,97,"Nov 28, 2018",Jackson Free Press,EDITOR'S NOTE: 'Tis the Season for Kindness,"One day, I was sitting at one of the computers at church when my friend walked over and handed me something.

""I saw this and thought of you,"" she said. It was a package with something that felt like it was made of metal.

I unwrapped it and found an orange and yellow lapel pin from designer Kate Gabrielle with the words ""Make America Kind Again"" written in '70s-esque letters with little white flowers surrounding it. It was cute, and very much my style.

When I wear it, it serves as a reminder, both for myself and anyone else who notices it, of the power of kindness. I will be the first to admit that ""make America kind again"" is a super hokey phrase, but it's a good reminder, and also so necessary right now when we're in the midst of a Senate race that's brought out the worst in some of our politicians (cough, cough, Cindy Hyde-Smith). Roll your eyes all you want, but we do need to make America, and Mississippi, kind again.

One of my favorite people to follow on social media is Bob Goff, a lawyer, honorary U.S. consul for Uganda and the founder of nonprofit Love Does, which does work in education and human rights in post-conflict countries. He's the kind of person who carries around balloons to give to people as a gesture of kindness. He wrote books such as ""Love Does"" and ""Everybody, Always,"" which I just finished reading.

In ""Everybody, Always,"" Goff talks about the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Bible. You probably know the story. This is an extremely abbreviated version, but a man who was traveling was attacked and abandoned on the side of the road. A priest and a Levite passed him by. It was a Samaritan, essentially an outcast in that time, who showed him mercy and took care of him.

Jesus used this parable to answer the question of ""Who is my neighbor?"" The answer? ""The one who showed him mercy.""

It's important to note here that the man on the side of the road was Jewish, and the one who saved him was Samaritan, who were the enemy of Jews back in that time period. Yet it was a Samaritan who showed the man mercy.

Goff uses this story to illustrate his point that everyone is our neighbor. The people who work in our offices and buildings, those who make the dreaded small talk in elevators. The people who go to your church. The people who serve your food or coffee (for the love of God, please tip them). City-council members. Mayors. Governors. Senators. Parents. Friends. Enemies. Frenemies. People of different races. Immigrants. People who love differently than you do or identify differently. In this great big world, we're all neighbors, and though we come from different backgrounds and paths of life, we all have one thing in common: We're human. We deserve kindness and love. All of us, no matter who we are or where we come from.

The day we go to press with this issue is Giving Tuesday, and my inbox is full of ways to give back, and if you did participate in giving back, good on you.

But it's not just about donating to a charity, though that's helpful for all these organizations that are trying to make a difference. It's also about doing nice things for people—doing the right thing. Showing them compassion and kindness, regardless of who they are. Psychology Today says one act of kindness can affect a person's physical and mental health. Compassion and kindness reduce stress, boost immune systems, and help decrease emotions like anger, anxiety and depression. And I'm sure every single one of us could probably use more good stuff and less negativity in our lives right now.

The holiday season gives us the perfect excuse to show a little more kindness toward other people. After all, it's in the nature of the holiday. At least I hope it is. And it doesn't even have to be a gift.

It could be simple things like holding the door for someone or participating in cleaning up a local area, or just talking to someone you don't know. It could even be something else simple like shopping local. When you shop at local businesses, you're literally helping your neighbor, many times directly. And then you're helping where you live because statistics show that if you spend $100 locally, roughly $68 of that goes back into the community. And you know what? Best of Jackson provides another great way to give back to local businesses. It's your chance each year to let those businesses know how you feel about them. The finalist ballot goes online on Dec. 5, so make sure you show local business and people lots of kindness.

Mississippi is being portrayed in a negative way, again, thanks to Hyde-Smith's comments. People like her would have the rest of the world believe that we're backward people who still believe that people of another race or economic background are beneath us. And sure, some people may believe that. But that's not the Mississippi I know. The Mississippi I know isn't perfect by any stretch of the imaginations. We still deal with ghosts of our past day in and day out, but many of us are fighting against that. We're fighting for things like people's right to marry who they want and for a woman's right to bodily autonomy.

We're a creative bunch, and the only thing that stops us from accomplishing our goals is ourselves. We literally and figuratively stand on fertile ground. Let's make something of ourselves and show our fellow people more kindness this holiday season.

98,98,"Jul 29, 2019",The Conversation US,Why Trump’s stoking of white racial resentment is effective – but makes all working-class Americans worse off,"Many white men say they feel threatened by the increasing presence and success of minorities in the workplace.

As social scientists, we wondered if there is any evidence to support this perceived economic threat, a perception that can provide fertile ground for current rounds of racist and xenophobic political messaging.

Our work at the Center for Employment Equity at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, involves using Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data to explore workplace discrimination and diversity in states and cities across the U.S. Our aim is to discover and promote more equitable workplaces.

In our most recent report, called “Race, States and the Mixed Fate of White Men,” we examined the connection between minority populations and the job prospects of white men in private-sector companies.

White male privilege

Social scientists generally agree on three research findings about white men in the U.S. and the notion that they are losing their unearned but expected racial privileges.

First, white men at every education level are more likely than women and non-Asian minorities to get access to higher-wage jobs.

Second, while wages of average working-class people in the U.S. have stagnated in recent decades, and economic insecurity has grown, earnings for middle- and upper-class jobs – which are dominated by educated whites – have soared.

A third and more recent finding is that working-class white men are the group that is most racially resentful and most opposed to further immigration. This finding is based on analyses of survey data of the whole U.S. population examining both voting behavior and attitudes toward blacks and immigrants, zeroing in on President Donald Trump’s core supporters and the content of his political messaging to them.

This resentment probably explains why working-class whites, particularly men, are so receptive to President Trump’s anti-immigrant and racist messages – and why he targets them.

We suspected that the reception to racist and xenophobic messages might be a reflection of a growing competition between working-class whites and minority men for increasingly insecure, low-wage jobs.

White men dominate the executive suite

In our study, we compared different racial groups’ share of specific occupations with their percentage of their state’s workforce. In other words, we wanted to see how over- or underrepresented white, black and Hispanic men were in various jobs.

In general, we found that while some white men are prospering in executive and managerial roles, there is another group of white men with very different employment experiences.

At the top end of the labor market, our data showed that in every state, white men were overrepresented in executive and managerial jobs. But this white male privilege varied substantially by state. White men got even more of the top jobs in states with larger minority populations.

Texas, where minorities make up a third of the labor force and white men slightly more at 37%, was the most extreme. White men held 85% of private-sector executive jobs, making them overrepresented in top jobs by 138%.

Other states with sizable minority populations, such as California, New Mexico and Mississippi, similarly showed white men are especially advantaged in their control of the executive suite.

We found the same, if less extreme, pattern of white male advantage in private-sector management jobs.

Working-class competition

The pattern shifts dramatically, however, when we look at lower-paid working-class jobs.

These include machine and factory operatives, manual laborers and service occupations. Such jobs typically require high school degrees or less and tend to pay low wages. We find that more than half of these jobs pay below the living wage target of US$15 per hour.

In every state, black men were overrepresented as machine operatives, manual laborers and service workers. Hispanic men were overrepresented in machine operative and manual labor jobs in every state except Hawaii.

Working-class overrepresentation for minority men tends to be higher in states with small minority populations, such as Vermont, Maine and North Dakota.

But we wanted to get more directly at the degree to which working-class white men are competing for the same low-wage jobs as minority men. So we compared the number of black, Hispanic, Native American and native Hawaiian men performing operative, laborer or service jobs versus white men. In all states except Hawaii, these minorities are mostly black or Hispanic or both.

We found that in almost all states, working-class white men were competing for jobs with relatively large groups of minority men. And in 20, there were more minority men in these working-class jobs than white men. This pattern was most extreme in Washington, D.C. and California, where there were more than three minority men in these jobs for every white man.

Improving working-class lives

This does not mean that working-class whites have lost their entire racial advantage, but rather that it is more tenuous and exists in a context of wage stagnation and increased insecurity.

Research shows that many whites attribute being stuck in low-wage, insecure jobs to competition with minorities but are unaware of the larger trends of wage stagnation and growing insecurity for all working-class jobs.

So it is perhaps not surprising that this combination of visible competition and misplaced blame creates fertile conditions for stoking racial and immigrant resentment, particularly at a time of stagnating incomes, falling unionization and a growing lack of job security – problems that have done the most harm to the working class, regardless of race or national origin.

Perhaps it is politically simpler to encourage workers to see each other as rivals, but policy solutions that will actually make a difference need to focus on shared economic security – rather than blame games.

The Mississippi Health Department is reporting the state now has 12 cases of new coronavirus, including new cases reported Monday for Monroe and Pearl River counties.

The Mississippi Health Department on Wednesday evening reported the state's first presumptive case of the novel coronavirus. .

As of 11 a.m. Monday, the state Health Department listed a total 12 cases and that 289 people have been tested. Also, a case previously reported as being in Pearl River County was from Hancock County, the department reported.

State of emergency declared

On Monday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced two executive orders that will activate the National Guard to keep health care workers safe at testing centers being set up across the state, send all non-essential state workers home, require schools to set up ""distance learning"" and continue to offer students free and reduced lunches.

Reeves said any state or local government employees that miss work due to the outbreak will receive paid leave.

He said he hopes that businesses will follow the state's example in sending employees home and offering them paid leave.

Reeves also announced the closing of Mississippi casinos.

The biggest risk is that coronavirus cases in Mississippi overwhelm the health care system. He urged people to wash their hands and practice good hygiene.

""Be smart, be safe. Because, the reality is, while you may be healthy, this is about protecting Mississippi's most vulnerable. Even if you are healthy you are still need to protect your friends and your neighbors,"" Reeves said.

Reeves stressed the seriousness of the crisis. He said the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency considers the virus a ""level one"" disaster, which hasn't been seen since Hurricane Katrina.

Over the weekend, Reeves declared a state of emergency for Mississippi.

Reeves warned Mississippians to avoid any large gatherings, including church services Sunday, and to ""use caution"" and not panic. Reeves also asked for Mississippi schools to close for at least a week. Most were on spring break last week. Dozens of school districts have announced additional closure plans, with some announcing closures of two weeks, including Madison and Rankin districts.

Meals provided

A metro area school district is providing lunches for area students despite being closed.

The Rankin County School District posted on social media Sunday night that it would be providing ""grab and go"" lunches for free for any child 18 and under. While the student must be present to get a lunch, they do not have to be a student in the Rankin County School District.

Starting Tuesday, the lunches will be handed out at three schools via a drive thru line with more locations expected to be added. Parents can also purchase a lunch for $3.50. First responders in uniform can pick up a lunch for free.

Lunches can be picked up from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at McLaurin Elementary, Richland Upper Elementary and Pelahatchie Elementary.

The school district announced Saturday that schools would be closed though Friday, March 127.

In a separate effort, volunteers are providing a drop-off meal service for Jackson families in need, the People’s Advocacy Institute announced. Several organizations are partnering to provide breakfast and dinner for families through schools’ extended breaks. Meal drop-off operations are being guided by healthcare professionals, the release said, and volunteers will minimize one-on-one contact and group gatherings.

Call or text (615) 946-4197 to set up a meal drop-off location and time. The mobile meal hotline is being monitored 24 hours a day, according to the release.

Clinic opens to treat, test symptomatic people

A new Cough and Fever Clinic opening Wednesday at Hattiesburg Clinic's Cloverleaf Immediate Care facility will hopefully reduce the spread of new coronavirus and help those who may have symptoms of the disease without the worry of infecting others around them.

The clinic will be at Cloverleaf Medical Plaza, 5909 U.S. 49, in Hattiesburg.

Dr. Bryan Batson of Hattiesburg Clinic said the Cough and Fever Clinic will take walk-ins, but it is recommended that if people have questions about their symptoms to first contact their primary health care providers.

People without a primary care physician and those without insurance may also come to the clinic to be examined and if need be, tested. No one will be turned away for an inability to pay.

Batson said people should not visit the clinic if they do not have symptoms of the coronavirus, which include fever, a cough, runny nose, sore throat or in some cases difficulty breathing.

Dr. Rambod Rouhbakhsh with Forrest General Hospital said if the model is successful, other areas of the state might soon be developing similar facilities

If you suspect that someone is unfairly raising their prices to take advantage of the outbreak, you may be able to do something about it and our consumer protection team is ready to assist you with your questions.""

First patient had traveled to Florida

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Mississippi was a Forrest County man. The man, under the age of 65, had recently traveled to south Florida. The specific location was not released.

He traveled by plane through the Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, according to a report from the Sun Herald.

Dr. Steven Farrell, chief medical officer at Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg, said the patient did not have symptoms when he landed in Gulfport.

The man later felt ill and contacted the hospital, where staff were prepared to see him, giving him a mask and gloves before he entered the hospital to avoid potential contamination. He is self-quarantined at home, where he is doing well, hospital officials said.

More COVID-19 cases reported

The Health Department on Friday confirmed two additional cases of the virus, a man and a woman, in Forrest County.

One involves a woman over the age of 65, which is among the high risk demographics, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The department said in a news release that she had recently traveled to North Carolina.

Another reported case involves a woman in LeFlore County. She is self-isolating at home. Sunday's additional cases included one in Copiah County, two in Hinds County and one in Pearl River County.

Forrest County, Hattiesburg declare emergency

Following the lead of the federal government on Friday afternoon, Forrest County Board of Supervisor President David Hogan and Mayor Toby Barker both signed documents declaring the response to COVID-19 a local emergency, which has been categorized as a pandemic event, for both Forrest County and the City of Hattiesburg.

This declaration will allow for the use of resources, equipment and money if it is needed to provide for the health and safety of the citizens.

Hogan stated, “Declaring COVID-19 as a local emergency is a precaution. It cuts out the red tape that is often associated with procuring resources, allowing us to serve the residents of Forrest County quickly.”

Barker added, “We know that we are in for a long-term approach in responding to COVID-19, and we know we’ll need the resources to do it. The residents of Hattiesburg deserve our best efforts in keeping them healthy and safe. From personal protective equipment for our medical facilities and first responders to funding for overtime and services provided to our community, making sure they have these resources is a part of that.”

“This declaration is a necessary step in formalizing the process that will allow us to access state and federal resources. It doesn’t mean the situation we’re facing has escalated, but it does give us a tool to use should we need to,” stated Glen Moore, executive director of the Forrest County Emergency Management District. “We’ll continue to work with our emergency management partners at the local, state and federal levels to do all we can to keep our community healthy and safe.”

Coronavirus cases surging in region, U.S.

Mississippi's eight public universities will extend spring break a week, then switch to online classes, to inhibit the spread of coronavirus.

The state College Board made the announcement Thursday that universities would change their schedules for spring semester classes.

""The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff are paramount,"" Alfred Rankins Jr., Commissioner of Higher Education, said in a statement.

All eight universities are observing Spring Break this week or next and will extend the break an additional week to allow faculty members time to prepare to offer classes remotely.

Event cancellations in Capital City

On Monday, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced that gatherings of 50 or more people are now prohibited.

Organizers with the long-running Hal's St. Paddy's Parade and Festival parade in Jackson said the event will be canceled this year due to concerns over the spread of the virus.

It marks the first cancellation of the Jackson tradition in 37 years.

Other events across the state were being canceled, as state officials urged people not to have any events or gatherings with large numbers of people, including church services.

Out of an abundance of caution, Lumumba said, the city has postponed several events, including Tech JXN and the Fertile Grounds Expo.

Museum closings

On Thursday, the Mississippi Department of Archives and History also announced site and office closings beginning on Friday. All public events being held at those sites until the end of March have been postponed.

Sporting events canceled

The NCAA announced Thursday that it has canceled its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments amid growing coronavirus concerns. The Mississippi State women's basketball team was a lock to be selected to participate and the men's team had a chance to make the field.

The Southwestern Athletic Conference canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments in Alabama, where both Jackson State basketball teams were scheduled to participate Friday.

The Southeastern Conference suspended all on-campus sporting events between March 13 and at least March 30 and also stopped the men's basketball tournament in Nashville, Tennessee.

Conference USA, the conference Southern Miss belongs to, also announced Thursday a suspension of all spring sports competition, effective immediately, until further notice.

Mississippi, federal court system changes

The Mississippi Supreme Court issued an order Sunday outlining changes due to coronavirus. All courts will remain open, but individual judges have the discretion to postpone any trials on their own docket scheduled through May 15, 2020. Courts shall not conduct any proceedings that require witnesses or parties to travel from an infected area or that involve vulnerable persons, according to the high court.

No more than 50 people are allowed in a courtroom at a given time, changing from the previously limited 200. Access to trials is limited to judges, attorneys, witnesses, security and other necessary people.

Jury summonses may not be sent to jurors which would be returnable to any date prior to May 18, 2020.

Federal courts also announced changes on Monday.

Through March 31, all non-essential civil and criminal cases set for a hearing or trial in any federal courthouse in the Southern District of Mississippi have been postponed.

However, Chief Judge Dan Jordan said initial appearance, arraignments, detention hearings, and issuance of warrants are essential, therefore, they will go on as scheduled.

It will be up to the presiding judge to determine during the period if any other court matter is essential and should go forward or whether the matter can be conducted via videoconference or telephone, Jordan said.

In the Northern District, all proceedings, civil and criminal, scheduled or typically undertaken in person should be continued or conducted by video or telephone conference to every extent possible, said Chief Judge Sharrion Aycock.

Non-essential government employees sent home

Reeves said Monday all non-essential state and local government employees will be sent home. It will be up to agencies to determine which employees are non-essential.

Lumumba said non-essential Jackson city offices and government leased buildings will be closed and non-essential city employees will be required to work remotely. Water and Sewer Business Administration will remain open.

Jatran buses are being cleaned nightly, Lumumba said, and drivers are being provided personal hygiene supplies. Residents should use online city services as much as possible.

All non-essential Hinds County employees will leave work at 5 p.m. today and not return until after March 30, Hinds County supervisors announced at a press conference Monday afternoon. All employees will be paid during the time off, said board president Robert Graham. It was not immediately known if the affected employees would lose sick days due to the break.

“We’re still working our way through that,” Graham said. “This is all brand new to us. We just don’t know…we wanted to be fair to our employees based on the fact that children are at home, they have elderly parents, just a number of different things that we took into consideration and the only way to be fair was just to do it across the board, to all of our employees.”

While non-essential employees will also be sent home from the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department, deputies will continue to patrol. Of those deputies, Sheriff Lee Vance said, “there’s nothing we can do to keep them absolutely safe, it’s basically the nature of the business.”

Visitation at the Raymond Jail has been limited to attorneys only until March 30, Vance said.

County offices, including justice court, will remain open, Graham said.

“One of the things we don’t want to do is try to run each individual department or try to tell any judge what to do,” he said. “They will be making their decisions. Keep in mind, we’re going to modify schedules. We’re not going to close the county government. County government will be open and up and running.”

Graham said the reason for the March 30 date was because it’s “past the 14 day isolation period.” Surrounded by almost a dozen county officials in a room with approximately 35 people, Graham noted that earlier in the day the CDC recommended limiting gatherings to 10 people.

“We’re in violation right now but we’re in violation in the right way for the right reason at the right time for the right cause,” he said.

The CDC recommendations will affect how the county does business but an outline of what it would look like was not immediately clear.

“We’re working our way through that,” Graham said. “To be honest with you, we don’t know yet. We have to make those up as we go along and make sure that we’re trying to make the best decisions for the public as well as our employees.”

Graham said, to his knowledge, no county employees had called in sick due to coronavirus symptoms.

“We want people to remain calm,” he said. “We’re calm. We want people not to panic. We’re going to get through this. That’s the best part of it, we’re going to get through it.”

100,100,"Feb 25, 2019",Senior Housing News,"Regional Operator Blake Management to Expand Nationwide, Makes C-Suite Hires","A senior living management company with a regional footprint in the Southeast has set its sights on becoming a national presence centered on hospitality.



Jackson, Mississippi-based Blake Management Group (BMG) has quickly grown in recent years by forging joint ventures with development partners, and has made several executive hires in recent months, including adding a new president, COO and chief strategy officer.



BMG’s development partners include Cardinal Ventures; Quality Senior Living; and LifeCare Properties, which last October announced a plan to build up to 10 Blake-branded senior living communities nationwide over the next five years. The company is also working with Legendary Living, the new senior living arm of Legendary LLC, a Destin, Florida-based real estate development and management firm that has specialized in luxury hotel, multifamily and resort properties since its founding in 1991.

BMG currently acts as a third-party manager for 22 senior living communities in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The company plans to grow at a pace of about four to five new community openings annually over the next three to four years, according to BMG’s CEO, Jeremy Cole.



“Conservatively, with our development partners’ pace for designing and building Blake communities, we’ll likely be a 40-plus community company in our future,” Cole told Senior Housing News. “BMG has always been comfortable flying under the radar, and we will continue to operate this way; however, [while] growing and becoming more relevant.”



While The Blake is BMG’s flagship brand, it also operates communities under other brand names, such as The Claiborne at Adelaide in Starkville, Mississippi.

“We know how to build other brands and enable asset partners to grow without the Blake flag, and then manage under our single operating platform much like a Marriott does,” Cole said.



Focus on hospitality



While all of BMG’s communities are designed with local markets in mind, they do share many of the same design elements, amenities and services.



Most of the company’s communities have between 100 and 110 units. While some have a mix of independent living units as well as those designed for higher-acuity residents, BMG’s operational “sweet spot” lies in properties with 65% assisted living and 35% memory care units, Cole said.



They also come with a dedicated space for a cafe, a functioning coffeeshop and ice cream bar, chapels, a business center that doubles as a library and plenty of common spaces for residents to gather. BMG places a special emphasis on fine dining and wellness, with multiple dining venues headed up by executive chefs and staffed with dedicated servers. The company’s dining program is run by Vice President of Dining Darin Leonardson, a former executive chef with Google who joined the company last September.



“We have always wanted to celebrate food and our dining process,” Cole said. “We invest in this experience during the design of our communities and our staffing model, both at HQ and onsite.”

As a result of BMG’s resort-style mix of services and amenities, the company’s communities are competitively priced around the top tier of local markets.



“We work very hard to be an affordable luxury option,” Cole said. “We work very hard to be the nicest offering, the most valuable offering, both from a real estate and a customer service perspective.”



The company has found success in its hospitality-forward model, aided in part by its ambitious early push for deposits. Sales start early, with deposits coming in as early as a year before the community gets its certificate of occupancy.



“One leading metric we’re proud of is how fast we stabilize within 16 to 18 months, which begins with a successful pre-opening and deposit,” Cole said. “We have been stable in certain communities within six to 12 months.”



Hiring for growth



As a fast-growing senior living operator, BMG is only as strong as the employees it can hire.



“The race in senior living will be about transforming how we perform leadership development, which will result in high-performing teams and making good on the promises we make to seniors and loved ones,” Cole told SHN. “New designs and fresh paint are an edge, the marathon will be innovation in recruitment, training and retention.”



BMG named a new president last September, and this week announced the appointment of COO Katie Kleinsmith and Chief Strategy Officer Jessica Heck. Kleinsmith will oversee the company’s core operational functions, help create programs and support onsite community teams, while Heck is tasked with overseeing new developments, sales, strategic growth and project development in addition to being BMG’s new spokesperson.



Kleinsmith is a seasoned industry veteran with 28 years of experience at companies such as Manor Health Care, Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) and Marriott Senior Living, while Heck has spent time at companies including Elmcroft and Atria Senior Living.

Any time BMG enters into a new market, it has a methodology for recruitment. The company finds new workers through job fairs and social media, and opens a central office for each community early on during the construction phase.



“In new development we promote our community both from a sales and recruiting process pretty heavily,” Cole explained. “We get a lot of qualified leaders and applicants there.”



The company also looks to universities as a source of new workers, particularly in college towns with Blake communities. But there’s more work to be done to attract a new generation of employees to the senior living industry, Cole said.



“No one goes to universities and certainly not to Ivy League programs to work in senior living. We need to change that,” he explained. “Terms like ‘conscious capitalism’ get thrown around recruiting circles these days, [and] you can’t find more fertile ground on having a meaningful career than senior living.”

101,101,"Mar 4, 2020",Washington Post,The Daily 202: Joe Biden forged a Super Tuesday coalition that could win the Democratic nomination – and presidency,"AD

Biden won Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma by double digits. Maine, which the Sanders camp expected to carry, remains too close to call. Sanders won the Pine Tree State decisively in 2016.

“We increased turnout,” Biden told supporters in Los Angeles. “The turnout turned out for us!”

Turnout grew not because of Biden’s ground game, which was essentially nonexistent in the 14 states and one U.S. territory that voted on Tuesday. In fact, he won big in several places where he spent little time and made no real investment in a field program. Momentum mattered more than money. After spending more than half a billion dollars of his personal fortune, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg’s only win came in American Samoa, where Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) also got a delegate.

AD

AD

Turnout also did not appear to grow because of a surge in young voters that Sanders keeps promising will materialize any time now. Exit polls show about 1 in 8 voters in Super Tuesday states were 18- to 29-year-olds, compared to 3 in 10 who were 65 or older. Sanders struggles with these older voters.

Instead, turnout appears to have spiked from 2016 to 2020 in key general election battlegrounds because antipathy toward President Trump continues to galvanize suburban moderates to get engaged in Democratic politics. A Washington Post statistical model suggests Biden won nearly 60 percent of voters who sat out the 2016 primary but cast ballots on Tuesday. Our turnout analysis, conducted by in-house data scientist Lenny Bronner, also shows that Biden possibly received nearly 90 percent of Clinton’s 2016 voters.

Biden romped in the suburbs, excelling with the constituencies that fueled the Democratic takeover of the House in 2018. In addition to his stalwart base of African American voters, the foundation of his wins across the South, Biden fared well with white voters in suburbs from Richmond and Raleigh, N.C., to Houston and Hampton Roads, as well as Nashville and Minneapolis.

Exit polls show that many decided to back the former vice president in the days after his South Carolina landslide. These voters think he’s the most electable choice to take back the White House and that beating Trump is more important to them than agreeing with a candidate on the issues. It also helped Biden that the field winnowed, and he received endorsements on Monday from former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

AD

AD

Biden credited his win in Minnesota, where Sanders invested heavily and held a massive rally on Monday night, to Klobuchar. Exit polls there showed 6 in 10 voters decided whom to vote for in the past few days. Biden won about half that group.

Consider Virginia as a window into why turnout grew. In 2016, 785,000 people participated in the Democratic primary. On Tuesday, about 1.3 million people did. This broke the turnout record set in the 2008 primary that pitted Clinton against Barack Obama. About a quarter of Virginia primary voters were African American, and roughly 6 in 10 chose Biden, according to the exit polls. But Biden also won 6 in 10 white voters older than 45. While Sanders won 3 to 1 among all younger voters, Biden still won the primary in Virginia by 30 points.

“The precincts that saw the biggest increases were largely clustered in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads metropolitan area,” Greg Schneider reports from Richmond. “In Henrico, Kate Giska, 39, a small-business owner and political independent, described Sanders as ‘just too extreme, just like Trump is a little too extreme. We’re kind of, like, in the middle, just, like, status quo, just get along.’ She voted for Biden, someone she thinks has appeal for ‘the middle voter, a candidate that can attract the masses.’ None of more than 50 voters interviewed at three Virginia Beach precincts on Tuesday said they planned to vote for Sanders, even if they liked some of his positions. Many said they simply thought Biden had a better chance of winning in November.”

Biden won from coast to coast among those who identify as “somewhat liberal.” He dominated among conservative and moderate primary voters across most of the 14 states that voted, with the exceptions of Colorado and Vermont. But he also fared very well among the large share of voters who self-identify as “somewhat liberal.” Biden won that group by a roughly 2 to 1 margin over Sanders in Alabama, Virginia and North Carolina. Those latter two states will both be battlegrounds this fall.

Sanders’s coalition is built around liberals and Latinos. One reason he’s widely expected to win California, although the race has not been called with 81 percent of precincts reporting, is that two-thirds of voters described themselves as liberal in the exit polling, and this group voted more than 2 to 1 for Sanders.

Hispanic voters also showed a strong preference for Sanders in the states where they made up the largest shares of the Democratic electorate. About 3 in 10 voters in Texas identified themselves as Hispanic, and just under half of them voted for Sanders. Biden got about 1 in 4 Hispanic votes in the Lone Star State. The share of Hispanic voters was slightly smaller in California, but Sanders won the group by a larger margin, capturing a majority. Biden got about 1 in 5 Latinos in the Golden State, giving Sanders a margin of about 30 percentage points, according to the exits.

Elsewhere, though, Biden made inroads with non-college-educated whites who backed Sanders four years ago. Exit polls suggested Biden had a greater than 2 to 1 lead among white voters in Alabama, and nearly as wide an edge in Virginia. Biden had a smaller but still visible lead among white voters in Minnesota and Oklahoma and a smaller edge in Tennessee, North Carolina and Massachusetts. In Maine and Texas, Biden and Sanders were neck and neck among white voters. And Sanders led among white voters in Vermont, Colorado and California.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke to voters in Detroit on March 3, a week before the state votes in the Democratic presidential primary. (The Washington Post)

Elizabeth Warren’s humiliating third-place finish in Massachusetts, a state she’s represented in the Senate for eight years, makes continuing her campaign increasingly difficult to rationalize. Warren also finished fourth in her native Oklahoma, with 13.4 percent, under the 15 percent threshold required to win any delegates, although not all the precincts have reported. Speaking early Tuesday evening in Detroit as polls remained open in several states, Warren pledged to forge ahead and seemed to plead with late deciders not to keep breaking for Biden. “What I see happening is a lot of folks trying to turn voting into some complicated strategy,” she said, acting almost as if Super Tuesday hadn’t happened. “They are playing games about prediction and strategy. Prediction has been a terrible business.”

After polls closed, Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey backed away from his insistence that the former New York mayor would fight on until the Democratic convention in Milwaukee. “You make an assessment in any campaign like this after any time there is a vote,” he said. “As of right now we are committing to stay in, but we will see what happens tonight.” Another campaign aide told Michael Scherer that the campaign is regularly reevaluated, and that process would continue Wednesday, when Bloomberg is expected to return to New York from Florida.

Whether Warren and Bloomberg stay in or not, this has effectively become a two-man race, pitting the 77-year-old Biden – first elected to the Senate in 1972 – against the 78-year-old Sanders, who was first elected mayor of Burlington 39 years ago Tuesday and who has been in Congress since 1991. But the ideological contrast between the septuagenarians is stark. Sanders promises revolution. Biden pledges restoration.

Sanders is also struggling in some states he won last time because Biden is a less effective foil for him than Clinton. The self-described democratic socialist benefited four years ago in several red states like Indiana, West Virginia and Montana from being the sole alternative to Clinton. He ran up the score among self-identified conservative Democrats. With the benefit of hindsight, many of these folks were probably voting more against Clinton than they were voting for Sanders. But she’s not on the ballot this time. Biden has higher favorability ratings among conservative Democrats than she did, and there were other alternatives, including Bloomberg.

Consider Oklahoma. Sanders won the primary there four years ago by 10 points. “Clinton won self-identified Democrats by 9 points, according to exit polls. But independents, who were free to cross over, backed Sanders by 48 points,” Dave Weigel notes. “While Sanders ran to Clinton’s left, he beat her among self-identified ‘moderate or conservative’ voters by 11 points. Without Clinton as a foil, the Sanders vote fell apart. … Sanders badly lost moderate and conservative voters [on Tuesday], losing them to Biden by 28 points. … Bloomberg won 24 percent of the moderate vote, to just 11 percent for Sanders.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used his speech on Super Tuesday to contrast his voting record in the U.S. Senate with that of former vice president Joe Biden (Reuters)

The fight for the nomination could still drag into the convention in Milwaukee in July, even if Biden continues to consolidate support among moderate voters. Most delegates still have not been awarded, and 32 states still need to vote. Sanders expressed optimism in Vermont last night. “I tell you, with absolute confidence, we’re going to win the Democratic nomination,” he told thousands of supporters.

But, but, but: The calendar is going to get harder for Sanders. “The marquee primary next week will be in Michigan,” Dan Balz explains. “Sanders scored a major upset there four years ago against Clinton, although his victory margin was narrow. Also on the calendar next week is Missouri, a state Sanders lost by less than a percentage point and where the delegates split almost evenly. Missouri will provide another test of Biden’s and Sanders’s support among African Americans, who make up about a fifth of Democratic turnout in that state. Because Washington state has switched from a caucus to a primary, Sanders, though favored, will have a more difficult time piling up the kind of delegate margin he did in 2016. Meanwhile, Mississippi should be fertile ground for Biden, as African Americans made up about 70 percent of the Democratic electorate there in 2016 — even more than in South Carolina.

AD

AD

“The round of primaries on March 17 includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Sanders lost Florida badly to Clinton and will face serious resistance again this year because of qualms about his left-wing agenda. He also lost Arizona and Ohio decisively. Only Illinois was close, though Sanders was on the losing end there, as well. A week after that, on March 24, Georgia holds a stand-alone primary, and there again, Biden will be favored based on the size of the African American vote.”

For his part, Biden will face growing scrutiny that he’s mostly avoided since stumbling in Iowa. He faced few attacks in the last three debates. His performances on the stump can be uneven. Trying to stay disciplined, he delivered his speech in Los Angeles from a teleprompter. Most of it duplicated what he said on Saturday night in his victory speech in South Carolina. “They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing,” he said. “For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.”

More from the states

In Alabama, Jeff Sessions is headed to a March 31 Republican runoff against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in his quest to win back his old Senate seat. “Other Republicans, including Rep. Bradley Byrne and former state Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, significantly trailed,” Mike DeBonis reports. ""Trump has so far remained silent on the race, and Republicans in both Alabama and Washington are speculating whether he might now get involved to block Sessions. … Meanwhile, in North Carolina, Democrats nominated a centrist favorite of national party leaders to take on GOP Sen. Thom Tillis in what promises to be a much more competitive race.”

Texas Reps. Key Granger (R) and Henry Cuellar (D) both claimed victory over primary challengers. “‘You know, we can keep waiting, but it remains 60-40 so far, so I’ll stay here,’ Granger said Tuesday evening … Asked if she was declaring victory, she said ‘yes,’” the Texas Tribune reports. Cuellar “was still fighting a primary challenge from attorney Jessica Cisneros … As of early Wednesday morning, Cuellar garnered 51.6% of the vote to Cisneros' 48.4%, with incomplete returns. The Cuellar victory is a setback for a massive coalition of Democratic allied groups, ranging from the Justice Democrats to EMILY's List to the League of Conservation Voters.""

Long lines kept some Texans waiting to vote until late into the night. “Dozens of Democratic voters were still waiting to cast ballots at midnight in Houston, turning Super Tuesday into a painful slog for some citizens amid questions about how the County Clerk's office had allocated its voting machines across the county,” the Houston Chronicle reports. “Some people in line gave up and walked away … Polls closed at 7 p.m., but voters still can cast ballots as long as they stay in line. … After waiting four hours to cast his own ballot at TSU, Bryan Escobedo walked outside to a crowd cheering his patience. He spoke of voters sharing painkillers and water to keep their neighbors engaged. … The nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project took issue with the delays, noting that many polling places with long waits were in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods.”

The special election in California to replace Katie Hill, the freshman Democratic congresswoman who resigned after admitting an extramarital affair, will head to a runoff. “Democratic Assemblywoman Christy Smith of Santa Clarita and Republican defense contractor Mike Garcia were in a tight race … in one of California’s most competitive congressional districts,” the Los Angeles Times reports. “Former Rep. Steve Knight, the Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Hill, a Democrat, was running third and on the verge of losing his shot at recapturing his seat representing the northern suburbs of Los Angeles.

Commentary from the opinion page:

The new world order

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) asked top health officials at a Senate committee hearing March 3 if they would be honest about the U.S. response to coronavirus. (Reuters)

Vice President Pence said any American can get tested for coronavirus if a doctor orders it.

The comments “perplexed some public health officials, as physicians already have discretion to order testing. The announcement also raised questions about whether the government can rapidly accelerate the production of testing kits, as well as how much patients will ultimately have to pay for getting tested,” Seung Min Kim, Maria Sacchetti and Brady Dennis report. “Pence said roughly 2,500 testing kits approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be distributed by the end of the week, primarily to hospitals in affected areas as well as to others that have requested them. Those kits collectively represent about 1.5 million individual tests. Seema Verma, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said testing for the coronavirus is covered under Medicare, Medicaid and health-care exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act, but it remained unclear how the costs would be handled for the estimated 27 million Americans who are uninsured.”

Washington state confirmed three additional fatalities, bringing the total to nine: “Overall, the U.S. has reported more than 100 confirmed cases. The previously unreported deaths were former residents of the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a nursing home facility that has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the city northeast of Seattle. … Meanwhile, North Carolina reported its first coronavirus case Tuesday, bringing the total to 14 states … New York disclosed on Tuesday its second confirmed case. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) described the patient as a 50-year-old man from Westchester County, who had no recent history of foreign travel.”

Trump’s coronavirus effort has been undermined by mixed messages and falsehoods.

“The White House is handling the rapidly expanding coronavirus as a public relations problem as much as a public health crisis. Officials are insisting on message discipline among government scientists and political aides alike, part of what they say is a responsible effort to try to calm jittery Americans and provide uniform and transparent information,” Philip Rucker, Yasmeen Abutaleb and Ashley Parker report. Trump “has privately griped about what he considers to be hysteria from both the media and his own public health officials … White House aides managing the response have also sought to focus on tamping down what they consider to be alarmist rhetoric. …

“As Trump toured a laboratory at the National Institutes of Health on Tuesday afternoon, he and [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director] Anthony Fauci appeared chummy. The president heaped praise on the infectious-diseases expert, telling him, ‘The world is extremely happy that you’re involved.’ But their bonhomie belied the tensions in an administration where the president tolerates only one star: himself. Public health experts and other government officials have found themselves struggling to manage the delicate balance of performing their jobs while not angering the president or his political aides.”

Quote of the day

“You should never destroy your own credibility. And you don’t want to go to war with a president,” Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci told Politico. “But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.”

Across America, the virus has triggered cancellations, closures and contingency planning.

Trump has “said he did not agree with contingency plans being considered for the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournament, including a proposal to play games in empty arenas,"" Toluse Olorunnipa, Heather Kelly, Hannah Natanson and Julie Zauzmer report. ""'I don’t think it would be necessary,' [he said]. With the lack of a coordinated national approach, local officials and individual communities are rushing to make their own plans. Some schools are considering closures, some companies have implemented restrictions on travel for employees, and religious organizations are altering how they conduct services.”

In turf warfare, the CDC temporarily blocked a top FDA scientist from its campus.

“Timothy Stenzel, who is the director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, was made to wait overnight on the weekend of Feb. 22 — as senior health department officials negotiated his access in a series of calls — before Centers for Disease Control granted him permission to be on campus. Stenzel's visit had been expected … The FDA had dispatched Stenzel to the CDC in an effort to expedite the development of lab tests for the novel coronavirus outbreak,” Politico reported.

The outbreak continues to spread widely in the Middle East, Asia and Europe.

Iran has confirmed 92 deaths and 2,992 cases, while South Korea has 5,238 cases and Italy 2,263. China, which remains the worst-hit nation, announced 38 new deaths. Chile and Argentina reported their first cases yesterday, widening the numbers across Latin America. (Adam Taylor, Teo Armus and Rick Noack)

The U.S. Travel Association anticipates international inbound travel to the country will drop 6 percent between now and May, the largest dip in global visitation since the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. ""The forecast takes into account factors including hotel bookings, airline data and consumer sentiment data,” Hannah Sampson reports.

North Korea’s isolation is a possible virus buffer – but also a concern.

“Kim Jong Un’s insular world also could face a major crisis if the virus that causes covid-19 finds its way in. An outbreak could overwhelm the feeble health system — ranked 193 out of 195 on the Global Health Security Index — in a country already stalked by malnutrition and diseases such as tuberculosis,” Simon Denyer reports.

Doctors in Italy are turning into patients.

“In an effort to cope, Italy is graduating nurses early and calling medical workers out of retirement. Hospitals in the hardest-hit regions are delaying nonessential surgeries and scrambling to add 50 percent more intensive-care beds,” Loveday Morris reports.

Trump spoke with a senior Taliban leader by phone.

This was apparently the first direct verbal communication between a U.S. president and the Afghan insurgent force since the Afghanistan war began. Anne Gearan reports: “Trump confirmed the Taliban’s announcement Tuesday that he had spoken by phone with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s top political leader. ‘I spoke to the leader of the Taliban today. We had a good conversation. We’ve agreed there’s no violence, we don’t want violence; we’ll see what happens,’ Trump told reporters at the White House. ‘They’re dealing with Afghanistan, but we’ll see what happens. We had actually a very good talk.’ Baradar is a senior figure representing the insurgent group in talks with the United States in Doha, Qatar. …

""The phone call is notable for the stature it confers on Baradar. U.S. presidents typically deal directly with other heads of state or government … In a statement, Baradar welcomed the phone call and said that ‘we assure with full confidence that if the U.S. implements the agreement, this will have positive impact on the bilateral relations in future.’ … The Taliban statement quotes Trump as saying the Taliban has been ‘fighting for your country’ and that the time has come for the United States to leave. The Taliban said Trump also pledged that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will speak to [Afghan President Ashraf] Ghani ‘to remove hurdles in the way of intra-Afghan dialogue.’”

The Pentagon said overnight the U.S. military has conducted an airstrike against Taliban forces in southern Afghanistan, the AP reports: “Spokesman Col Sonny Leggett said in a tweet Wednesday that it was the first U.S. strike against the militant group in 11 days. He said the attack was to counter a Taliban assault on Afghan government forces in Nahr-e Saraj in the Helmand province.”

Iran has sharply increased its uranium stockpile since Trump blew up the nuclear accord.

“Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency reported a near-tripling of Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium just since November, with total holdings more than three times the 300-kilogram limit set by the nuclear accord,” Joby Warrick reports. “Iran also substantially increased the number of machines it is using to enrich uranium, the agency said, allowing it to make more of the nuclear fuel faster. … Iran’s low-enriched uranium, the kind typically used in nuclear power plants, would have to undergo further processing to be converted into the highly enriched uranium needed for nuclear bombs. Independent analysts said the bigger stockpile and faster enrichment rate has substantially decreased Iran’s theoretical ‘breakout’ time — the span needed for acquiring enough weapons-grade material for a single nuclear bomb.”

Domestic developments that shouldn't be overlooked

At least 24 people were killed when tornadoes struck central Tennessee on March 3. (The Washington Post)

The tornadoes in Tennessee killed at least 24.

“An EF-3 tornado with winds up to 165 mph tore across the Nashville area,"" Brandon Gee, Meryl Kornfield and Kim Bellware report. Some of the dead were children. ""Dozens more are still missing as of Wednesday morning. The destruction stretched for 50 miles across four counties, and Gov. Bill Lee (R), who surveyed the area via helicopter, said it will take days just to assess the scope of the damage.”

A Louisiana case is the first abortion test for the new Supreme Court.

Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, no state has passed more abortion restrictions that Louisiana. Today, a repopulated and more conservative Supreme Court will consider one of those laws. “Some politicians here wonder if it might be the breakthrough they’ve been waiting for in a decades-long effort to rid the state, and the nation, of abortion,"" Robert Barnes reports from the Pelican State. ""‘I prayed one day that it would come, but I never thought it would be with this bill,’ said state Sen. Katrina Jackson, a Democrat who calls herself ‘pro-whole life’ and says she has been ‘very aggressive’ in pursuing legislation to impose more restrictions. … Abortion providers say Jackson’s law would force two of the state’s three abortion clinics to close. It’s hard to overstate what a decision about this law — requiring difficult-to-obtain hospital admitting privileges for doctors who perform abortions in clinics — will reveal about this Supreme Court and its jurisprudence on [abortion] … It will be the first time the two justices selected by President Trump, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, confront the merits of an abortion case. It marks a key moment for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who has never voted against an abortion restriction, in his pivotal role at the court’s center.”

A new White House questionnaire includes a litmus test for prospective appointees.

“Candidates applying to join [Trump’s] administration will now have to explain what part of Trump's campaign message ‘most appealed’ to them and why,” CNN reports. “The new questionnaire, distributed by the White House's Presidential Personnel Office to federal departments on Monday, … is the latest move by the office's new head John McEntee to emphasize loyalty to the President in the hiring process.”

Speaking of loyalty, John Bolton’s book release date was pushed back to May amid Trump's efforts to block publication, per Tom Hamburger.

BARRETT BOYCOTT -- The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote today on approving Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the Supreme Court. But don’t expect Senate Democrats to be there.

In protest of the GOP’s lightning-fast effort to confirm ACB before the election, Democrats are planning to sit out the committee markup. And instead, they plan to place pictures of people who have been impacted by the Affordable Care Act on their empty seats, per CNN’s Manu Raju , as the party tries to hammer home the message that the public's health care is in jeopardy if ACB is confirmed.

The statement, from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Dems: “This has been a sham process from the beginning. … Throughout the hearings last week, committee Democrats demonstrated the damage a Justice Barrett would do – to health care, reproductive freedoms, the ability to vote, and other core rights that Americans cherish. We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.”

But it doesn’t look like their boycott will stop the GOP from moving forward. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said they can still hold the vote without Dems present. “Judge Barrett deserves a vote and she will receive a vote,” Graham said. “Judge Barrett deserves to be reported out of committee and she will be reported out of committee. Judge Barrett deserves to be on the Supreme Court and she will be confirmed."" The latest from Marianne: https://politi.co/3kpS0GA .

WHAT THE DUCK -- Negotiators are racing to finalize a coronavirus relief bill before the election. But even senior Democrats acknowledge that a deal could slip until the lame duck session of Congress. “The election is less than two weeks away, and I believe we’ll be back in Washington a week or two after the elections and we can do something there,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) told CNN. “At least elections will be behind us. People will know what their futures are.”

And Speaker Nancy Pelosi pinned the blame on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who reportedly advised the White House not to strike a deal before the election. “We obviously want to have a deal by November 3rd. That really is going to be up to whether the president can convince Mitch McConnell to do so,” Pelosi told a Sirius XM show. “However, I don't think, I think Mitch McConnell might not mind doing it after the election.”

But can we even count on action during the lame duck? Some in Washington believe Democrats would rather just hold out for a better deal under the next president if Joe Biden wins, while others think Trump would have little incentive to sign a big bill if he loses. (Not to mention, Congress is going to have to fund the government during that time period as well.)

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters that the lame duck “is a really hard time to get much done.” And here’s what Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told AP’s Andy Taylor: “I think Democrats would want to wait until the new president is sworn in and do it then. And I think Republicans probably would say unless the economy would take a bad turn between now and let’s say Dec. 1 -- and there doesn’t seem to be a sign that’s going to happen … we would say the economy is taking care of it.”

But at the same time, it’s hard to imagine Congress going home for the holidays without delivering much-needed relief to the American people — especially as coronavirus cases are only expected to climb in the winter. And as Pelosi said earlier this week, she wants a deal ASAP so she doesn't have “to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency.” More on the state of play from Marianne: https://politi.co/2HmC2hQ .

SPEAKING of notable quotes … When asked why White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was in the Capitol yesterday, Blunt quipped to reporters: “Maybe he just needed to get out of the White House.” (For the record, Meadows was there to brief Senate Republicans on the relief talks.)

FRUSTRATION IN THE FINAL STRETCH -- Two weeks away from the election, Trump is tweeting about rapper 50 Cent. He’s trashing Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. And he’s picking fights with CBS’ popular “60 Minutes” news program and revered journalist Lesley Stahl. To put it lightly: this is not the closing message that his GOP allies were hoping for.

It’s clear that Trump is on a completely different page than Senate Republicans, undermining the GOP as it fights to hang on to its Senate majority. And frustrations are spilling out into public view. “There’s just not any discipline. I mean the president’s got a great record to run on. But we don’t hear too much about it. And I just think that’s a mistake,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

Some Republicans pressed Meadows during a private GOP lunch about why the president isn't promoting their $500 billion stimulus bill and instead talking about spending more money than Pelosi. But after nearly four years of Trump, some lawmakers just seem resigned to it all. “What he’s thinking about that day, he says it. And that changes moment to moment. And that’s who he is,"" said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.). The dispatch from Burgess, Meridith McGraw and James Arkin: https://politi.co/3kgrHT8 .

ABOUT LAST NIGHT -- DOJ and national security officials held an unexpected news conference last night to announce that Russia and Iran have obtained voter registration data that could aid efforts to interfere in the election. And Iran has already used some of the data it obtained: the country was behind some threatening “vote for Trump” emails, officials said.

The statement from Pelosi and Intel Chairman Adam Schiff, who are among the lawmakers who will be briefed on the threats today: “The bedrock of our democracy is that every citizen has a right to vote and to have that vote count as cast. We cannot allow voter intimidation or interference efforts, either foreign or domestic, to silence voters’ voices and take away that right. … In the face of these ongoing attempts to undermine Americans’ confidence in our elections, it is more essential than ever that voters exercise their sacred constitutional right to vote and to participate in our democracy.”

IS GARDNER A GONER? -- Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado is one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection — and it’s largely because of Trump. The dispatch from Bloomberg Government’s Nancy Ognanovich: “A Democratic ad that aired in Colorado described Sen.

John Hickenlooper.

“Hickenlooper has maintained a healthy lead in the polls in a state that’s trended increasingly Democratic over the past decade, as it grows with an influx of Californians and minorities. It’s one of only two Senate seats held by a Republican in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016 — the other is in Maine — and it’s a cornerstone of the Democrats’ drive to regain control of the chamber. … Democrats’ confidence in winning the seat has grown so much that Senate Majority PAC, which is aligned with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and aired the peanut butter and jelly spots, recently canceled its remaining TV buy in Colorado and moved the $1.2 million to races considered more competitive.” More: https://bit.ly/35ljdUt .

Norman Winter | Savannah Morning News

The Garden Guy was looking at photos of last year’s trials and I was struck by one of a Mecardonia. If you are like most, Mecardonia probably conjures up visions of one of the stops that Moses and the Israelites made while looking for the promised land.

I have never written about this plant and was thinking there is a great chance my readers do not know about how wonderful and tough as nails is this flower and particularly the award-winning variety GoldDust.

GoldDust, a Proven Winners selection, has won 67 awards and from north to south and east to west. It was a Top Performer at Penn State, University of Georgia, Tennessee, Cornell, South Dakota State, Minnesota, Mississippi State, Oklahoma State, and the list goes on for pages. This speaks volumes and mostly of what it will do in your landscape, too!

At the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens in Savannah, we used it in our Cottage Garden around a rock stepping stone path. It was a lot like a Caribbean Cottage, we had gingers, plumbago, shrimp plants and tall garden phlox all pretty, but it was that patch of GoldDust mecardonia that seemed to illuminate the garden. It was also amazing in that it bloomed from the time we planted it until late fall. There are not that many plants that will do that.

Mecardonia has the common name axil flower and when I first started growing it was in the Scrophulariaceae family related to snapdragons and such. Well, that mysterious board of taxonomic nomenclature has moved it, and snaps, too, to the Plantaginaceae or plantain family. But alas they are still related.

Mecardonias are from South America on up through Central America and even into the warmer regions of the Southeastern United States. GoldDust however, is a hybrid and a great one reaching only about 5 inches in height. Can you only imagine a plant at that height that blooms with bright yellow flowers all growing season?

Norman Winter: Hardy hibiscus more than a summer dream in Savannah

Remarkably it spreads outward 20-inches allowing it to be unbeatable around stepping stones, small drifts of groundcover, and for sure, tumbling over the rims of baskets, boxes and containers like old world olive jars. It is easy to grow, requiring no deadheading. Your main goals are to provide sun and moist fertile soil.

You will expect GoldDust to be an annual and of course one worth every penny spent. To get a nice informal drift or patch, plant three or four spacing 12-16 inches apart. They are perennial in zones 10 and word on the street is they have surprised a few in colder zones with a spring return. Don’t count on it but celebrate if they do.

At the Young Plant Farms Flower Trials in Auburn last year, I saw a new application that was simply beautiful. They had combined Blue My Mind evolvulus with the Gold Dust mecardonia letting them intermingle. The icy blue and cheerful yellow created the perfect complementary partnership.

One of my favorite Proven Winners recipes and applications is a window box planting partnering Gold Dust mecardonia with Illusion Garden ornamental sweet potato and Superbena Peachy Keen verbena. It is a warm elegant partnership but not glaring or gaudy.

Tim Warner/Getty Images

Every college coach in the country knows where the talent hotbeds are. If they don't allocate resources and plant coaches in the fertile recruiting soil of certain states, they'll fail to hang with the elite.

When it comes to producing top-tier college football talent, you can probably guess the top four states. That, of course, would be Florida, California, Texas and Georgia. The only problem you may have is putting those in order.

That's why we're here.

Selecting the states producing the most (and best) college football players is an inexact science.

We analyzed the top 100 prospects of the past four recruiting classes (2015-18), according to the 247Sports composite rankings, and took a sample set of 150 of the best players or those with the highest ceilings coming back in 2018.

The states with the highest number of players mattered, of course, but this exercise wasn't just about recruiting rankings. It also takes into account already-established playmakers, and states that have produced the best players get bonus points.

What we came up with may surprise you. The on-the-field production doesn't lie, but neither do the states that churn out star prospects year in and year out. Let's take a look at the states that produce the most college football talent right now.","When it comes to producing top-tier college football talent, you can probably guess the top four states.

In its time, Cahokia was a mega marvel, an ancient Manhattan and the heart of America, second only to the lost city of Atlantis. It stood on fertile soil and people from all walks of life and a hundred miles away flocked to the city at its peak.

The city is shrouded by mystery and continues to be a big headache for researchers in terms of its origins. No one really knows what started Cahokia, or what ended it. Using evidence recovered on the site, it is possible to draw a hypothesis.

According to scholars, Cahokia was not just the center of America but the entire world, an imperialist city-state that was advanced but fell off the map for unknown reasons. To this day, historians are still baffled by its mystique and many consider it one of the greatest marvels of ancient America.

No one really knows the true origins of the Cahokians, but researchers suggest that nomads were responsible for the birth of this city with a third of the whole population coming from tribes over a hundred miles away. Different cultures blended into this boiling pot and one thing led to another and the rest is history.

Up to this day, Cahokia is still shrouded in mystery and archaeologists can't come to a final conclusion. Cahokia is a legend, even the name is a ""misnomer"" and named after a tribe that didn't set foot in the city until after over 1000 years. With technology getting more advanced, hopefully we could get a glimpse into this beautiful city, Cahokia, the modern ""Garden of Eden.""

2 Its Disappearance Has Been Attributed To Massive Floods (Mississippi Is Flood-Prone)

Nothing lasts forever, not even Babylon is invincible. City planning obviously wasn't as advanced before and this led to the Cahokians' demise, as the whole city stood on the floodplains of the Mississippi river and their doom was inevitable. Recently, flood gates were installed to help preserve the grounds, just after a few centuries.

Another acceptable theory of Cahokia's downfall might have been a hostile takeover of neighboring bandits in which the whole city was pillaged and burned to the ground until either its residents fought to the death or fled to other camps. And when Cahokia was drained of all resources, it then eventually got erased from the map.

108,108,"Sep 30, 2020",Washington Post,"When we need public health most, our leaders are waging war against it","As we determine what we must do to contain the virus in the coming months — be it through masks and social distancing or new tests, treatments or vaccines — we should also look back, to the origins of public health and why some in this country have never entirely bought into the public health approach.

In the early 19th century, cholera wreaked havoc on the world. Cholera is caused by a toxin-producing strain of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Patients suffer from the sudden onset of diarrhea and vomiting. Their skin is cold and clammy, turns a bluish gray and their eyes are sunken. As quickly as the illness comes on, in the absence of treatment, the victims of cholera too often die.

The Atlantic Ocean initially protected the United States. But by early June 1832, cholera had reached North American shores, first touching down in Quebec City and Montreal, then making its way down New York state’s canal system toward New York City.

Cholera was a disease of growing, crowded cities that had neither the public health infrastructure — clean water, sewage systems, hygiene and sanitation — necessary to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, nor the regulatory frameworks to balance private power and wealth with public good.

Some 30 years earlier, private banking interests had obstructed New York City’s plans for clean public drinking water, leaving the city as vulnerable and fertile ground for cholera to take hold. And as cholera began to spread, business interests prevented the action necessary to avoid an outbreak. The city’s health board was “more afraid of the merchants than of lying,” in the words of historian Charles Rosenberg.

AD

AD

Quarantines had effectively contained the spread of bubonic plague and smallpox, but they upended trade and commerce. Perhaps not surprisingly then, though Mayor Walter Browne prohibited any “vessel … having on board any person sick with … cholera” from approaching the city, quarantine hospital records for ships arriving between April and June 1832 disappeared, making it impossible to know whether quarantine regulations were being enforced. Cases might have slipped through in the name of commerce.

By late June 1832, New Yorkers were falling ill and dying of cholera, but this wasn’t immediately made public, even as physicians pleaded with officials to do so. The mayor and health board feared widespread panic and damage to the economy. Then, as now, journalists held public officials to account. The New York Courier and Inquirer condemned members of the health board for “their unwillingness to report facts.” This pressure made officials more forthcoming.

Almost half of the residents fled the city that summer. The poor, unable to leave and living in squalid neighborhoods like the infamous Five Points, bore the brunt of the disease. More than 3,500 died of cholera, equivalent to almost 120,000 relative to the city’s population today.

AD

AD

Cholera again struck the United States about a decade later, this time killing many not only on the Eastern Seaboard but also along the Mississippi River down to New Orleans and out West, following the California Gold Rush. An estimated 150,000 succumbed to the second (1829-1851) and third (1852-1859) cholera pandemics in the United States — about 1 percent of the nation’s population.

It was during the world’s third cholera pandemic, however, that John Snow solved the mystery of cholera’s transmission. The British physician hypothesized that cholera was transmitted by contaminated water. When cholera broke out in London in 1854, Snow went door to door, mapping the water source for each household: the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks, which drew water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames, or Seething Wells. Snow found that homes receiving the sewage-polluted water had a cholera death rate 14 times higher than other homes.

Snow’s research would help catalyze a new approach to disease control — the public health approach. The science of public health is epidemiology: gathering data, identifying and defining problems, characterizing and measuring risk factors and protective factors, developing and testing preventive measures and scaling up the measures that work. The philosophy of public health is social justice.

AD

AD

Elected officials, informed by Snow’s work, passed laws requiring water companies to move their intakes upriver along the Thames. Officials greeted subsequent cholera pandemics with more public health regulations: water filtration and chlorination and the establishment of health boards.

A confluence of interests helped further public health initiatives. Political revolution spread, first in France in 1789 and 1830, and then across Europe in 1848. A wave of strikes roiled Victorian-era England between 1837 and 1901. The ruling elite feared that if allowed to fester, poverty and disease among the lower classes would lead to civil unrest there, too. Social reformers also understood that a strong economy depended on healthy workers and social stability. “Simple prudence and self-interest,” writes historian Frank Snowden, “and not just humanitarian sentiment indicated reform.” In the United States, even robber barons like Andrew Carnegie recognized the need for “the reconciliation of the rich and the poor — a reign of harmony.”

To this day, the public health approach has been most likely to prevail when this sort of self-interest — be it economic, political or cultural — and humanitarian sentiment align.

AD

AD

The public health approach enjoyed its heyday in the early 20th century during such a period of alignment. There were New Deal programs and policies to support the poor and unemployed. Life expectancy rose by more than 30 years, almost all of which was attributable to public health advances, most importantly better hygiene, sanitation and housing, as well as immunizations.

In the decades to come, the public health approach would bring about the eradication of smallpox, decrease smoking rates, reduce motor vehicle deaths through safer car and roadway design, and produce many other triumphs.

But the second half of the 20th century also saw the rise of modern medicine. While both modern medicine and public health leveraged science to improve health, there was a crucial divergence. Modern medicine did tremendous good for those who could access it but was blind to those who could not — because of inability to pay, distance, a lack of time off for an appointment, systemic racism and more. Public health, however, sought out the marginalized, the oppressed and the hardest to reach. Snow went to the homes of the afflicted, not just the well-to-do who could afford the services of a physician. Public health recognized the value of all human lives, while in medicine, doctors focused on the patients in front of them. Modern medicine helped decouple the fates of the individual and the common.

AD

AD

During the same period, Americans witnessed the expansion of health insurance tied to certain kinds of employment. Racism played no small part in determining who had earned a right to health care and was considered deserving, and who was not. Health became an individual commodity and responsibility. Funding for public health has correspondingly declined relative to economic growth and total health-sector spending. Meanwhile, Europe, Canada and other developed nations established national health systems — a combination of public health and modern medicine — for the common good.","Snow’s research would help catalyze a new approach to disease control — the public health approach.

109,109,"Jun 26, 2018",FiveThirtyEight,Four Key Questions Today’s Primaries Will Help Answer,"July will be an election desert, so let’s enjoy the primaries while they last, shall we? This Tuesday, five states — Colorado, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah — are holding primary elections, while two more (Mississippi and South Carolina) are holding runoffs to decide primaries held earlier this month. Here are the four big questions we’re hoping those primaries answer (don’t forget to tune into our live blog on Tuesday night for full coverage of everything else on the ballot as well):

1. Does a Trump endorsement pack any punch against a Trump-like candidate?

On a few occasions this election cycle, President Trump has opposed the most Trump-like candidate in GOP primaries in the name of advancing a Republican candidate who seems better-equipped to win the general election. It happened in Alabama when Trump endorsed Luther Strange against Roy Moore, and it happened in West Virginia when he anti-endorsed Don Blankenship. So far, Trump’s record in these bouts has been mixed (Strange lost, but so did Blankenship). Two primaries this week will be good tests of how much the president’s endorsement really matters — or whether anti-establishment Republicans see through it.

In New York’s 11th Congressional District, which is based on Staten Island, Trump is backing the current member of Congress, Republican Dan Donovan. He won a 2015 special election after the previous occupant of the seat, Republican Michael Grimm, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and resigned. Now, after seven months in federal prison, Grimm is gunning for his old job, and he cuts a much more Trumpian figure than Donovan. Grimm, like Trump, has threatened the press and claimed to be the victim of a “witch hunt.” Also, former Trump staffers, such as Steve Bannon and Anthony Scaramucci, have endorsed him.

At first glance, Grimm looks like a long shot: Donovan has far more campaign cash, and the resources of the national party are behind him. But on Staten Island, that may not be an asset. Physically and demographically separate from the rest of New York City, the “forgotten borough” has developed a uniquely resentful, populist conservative political identity that made it fertile ground for Trump. He won the 11th District by 10 percentage points four years after Barack Obama carried it by 4. And Grimm still has plenty of loyal fans who fondly recall his attentiveness to constituents, especially after Superstorm Sandy hit the region in 2012. A Siena College poll conducted between May 29 and June 3 found Grimm leading Donovan 47 percent to 37 percent, but Trump may have rendered that datapoint obsolete by tweeting his endorsement of Donovan while the poll was still in the field. A more recent poll, taken June 20-21, gave Donovan a 7-point lead, but — internal poll siren! — the pollster is owned by a consulting firm that is working for Donovan.

The 11th District is 9 percentage points more Republican-leaning than the country at large, but the nastiness of the primary could provide a general-election opening for well-funded Army veteran Max Rose, the likely Democratic nominee. A win by Grimm, with his criminal past and scorched-earth campaigning, could drive many Donovan supporters into the arms of the Democrats in November. Grimm is also campaigning as a write-in candidate in the New York Conservative Party primary (also this Tuesday); if he wins their nomination, he’ll have a ballot spot in November and the option to continue on with his campaign. A three-way race in November could split the conservative vote and hand Democrats the seat.

The stakes aren’t as high in the Republican runoff for South Carolina governor (the Palmetto State has a safely red R+16 partisan lean), but Trump’s power to persuade is arguably even more on the line. On Monday, the night before the election, Trump popped down to Columbia to hold a rally for Gov. Henry McMaster, a longtime Trump supporter. However, McMaster’s opponent, John Warren, is running as a swamp-draining outsider at a time when an illegal lobbying and influence-peddling investigation focused on a prominent South Carolina political consultant has touched McMaster’s inner circle. Warren has also won the endorsements of the third- and fourth-place finishers from the first round of voting. Unlike in New York, however, the Trump-like businessman appears to be the underdog: In a Trafalgar Group survey conducted this month, McMaster led Warren 60 percent to 31 percent.

2. Can progressive Democrats notch another win against the national party?

Despite a high-profile brouhaha in Texas and one notable exception, the national Democratic establishment has generally done quite well in primaries so far this year. Three races on Tuesday will put that record to the test.

Colorado’s 6th Congressional District (a D+5 partisan lean) and its Republican incumbent, Mike Coffman, have for years been a target of Democrats, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee decided early on that former Army Ranger and Bronze Star winner Jason Crow was its man. That apparently didn’t sit well with former Energy Department adviser Levi Tillemann, who is running against Crow. Tillemann proved his anti-establishment bona fides by secretly recording a conversation he had with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer in which Hoyer urged him to drop out. Although Crow is a mainstream liberal on the issues, he has not taken up the mantle of either single-payer health care or pushing for Trump’s impeachment, both of which Tillemann supports. Crow has dominated the money race with $1.6 million raised, but Tillemann has kept his name in the spotlight with stunts like getting pepper-sprayed in a campaign ad.

Meanwhile, former Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner left the DCCC holding the bag in January when she decided not to run for Congress in New York’s 24th District (D+4). Local Democratic committees consolidated around Syracuse University professor Dana Balter as their candidate to take on Republican U.S. Rep. John Katko, but national Democrats were unsatisfied. Lo and behold, in April, a new candidate, Juanita Perez Williams, unexpectedly jumped into the race, prompting the local parties to denounce the DCCC’s “D.C. meddling.” But Perez Williams may not be the improvement on Balter that national Democrats had hoped. Perez Williams, who somewhat surprisingly lost the 2017 race for Syracuse mayor, failed to top even Balter’s paltry fundraising totals in the most recent period, and she has been attacked for participating in an anti-abortion march two years ago and writing pro-life Facebook posts in 2016. Balter, meanwhile, is favored by the progressive wing of the party.

Finally, in the Democratic primary for Maryland governor, Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker has the support of a litany of big names in Maryland Democratic politics but hasn’t raised a ton of money and isn’t the most engaging campaigner. Meanwhile, former NAACP President Ben Jealous’s support for free college tuition, single-payer health care and legalized marijuana in Maryland (all unlike Baker) has earned him the endorsement of Bernie Sanders and nearly $1 million in air and ground support from progressive outside groups. Even though Maryland is heavily blue (D+24), polling suggests that Baker and Jealous would be equivalent underdogs to popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Hogan enjoys a 57 percent approval rating … among registered Democrats.

Going into Tuesday night, our best guess is that two of the three establishment-flavored candidates will prevail. In Colorado, Crow is seen as a heavy favorite, and in New York, a Siena College poll taken earlier this month gave Perez Williams a 13-point lead over Balter. The progressive wing’s best shot at a win is probably in Maryland, where the two most recent polls of the primary have Jealous either tied with Baker or slightly ahead.

3. Can the Year of the Woman overcome even a multimillion-dollar juggernaut?

Women have been doing extraordinarily well in Democratic primaries in 2018, which hasn’t always been the case in the past. By contrast, wealthy businessmen spending millions of their own dollars to help them win elected office crop up almost every election cycle. What happens when these two recipes for success collide? Three races on Tuesday will give us our answer.

Even before the primary, 2018 has already broken the record for the most expensive gubernatorial election in Colorado (D+2) history. Emily’s List, a pro-choice women’s group that has helped many of the female candidates who’ve won 2018 primaries, has endorsed former state Treasurer Cary Kennedy in the Democratic primary. Kennedy’s campaign and the super PACs that are loyal to her have combined to raise nearly $4 million. However, that’s chump change compared to U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, the second-wealthiest member of Congress, who has poured $11.3 million of his own money into his campaign. And a super PAC supporting the second man in the race, former state Sen. Mike Johnston, has raised $5.7 million, including $2 million from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The second woman in the race, Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, is trailing so badly in fundraising that she has had to resort to attention-grabbing ads like one in which she gets a tattoo of her campaign slogan. According to a Strategies 360 poll conducted from May 23 to June 6, Polis led the primary with 34 percent, followed by Kennedy with 23 percent, Johnston with 12 percent and Lynne with 2 percent.

Likewise, the Democratic primary in New York’s 1st Congressional District may come down to wealthy real-estate investor Perry Gershon and former Suffolk County Legislator Kate Browning. Of the $2.1 million Gershon’s campaign has raised so far this cycle, $1.3 million was loaned or donated by the candidate himself; Browning has pulled in $494,000 total. Both argue they would be strong candidates in November against Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin in this R+12 seat: Gershon with his access to cash, Browning with a blue-collar appeal that she says helped her win her conservative legislative district by wide margins six times.

And the Democratic primary for Maryland’s 6th Congressional District (D+12) has been fought not over issues, but identity. David Trone, the owner of the Total Wine & More liquor store chain, has contributed more than $10 million to his own campaign, more than any U.S. House candidate in history save one — himself, two years ago. Trone argues that Congress needs more “disrupters” like him who have an easier time ignoring the desires of big-time donors like PACs and lobbyists, but state Delegate Aruna Miller thinks diversity is the more important factor in the race. Miller, who didn’t speak English when she immigrated from India at age 7, would become the only woman in Maryland’s congressional delegation. She has the support of Emily’s List and, at $1.4 million, enough fundraising to lead the money race in most any other district.

4. Will incumbent Democrats get a scare?

Despite early signs that Democrats might get their own version of the tea party, no Democratic members of Congress have lost primaries yet this cycle. That probably won’t change in one of these races, but a trio of long-serving Democratic members of Congress are facing genuine challenges. In Colorado’s 1st District (D+42), vocal progressive Saira Rao wants to become the first woman of color elected to Congress from Colorado. Rao’s fundraising levels have been competitive with those of incumbent Rep. Diana DeGette.

Likewise, progressive activist Suraj Patel has pulled in more than $500,000 in each of the last two quarters in New York’s 12th District (D+64), besting incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney. Maloney has courted controversy over the years, including by making comments in 2012 wondering if vaccines cause autism and by dismissing Patel’s donor list as containing “a huge amount of the name Patel.” Maloney has pilloried Patel for being a transplant from Indiana and for being linked to reported labor-law violations through his family business; the sharp attacks may imply that the race is closer than people assume.

And in New York’s 14th District (D+56), former Sanders campaign organizer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has an uphill climb against moderate Rep. Joe Crowley, the head of the Queens Democratic Party, No. 4 Democrat in the U.S. House and potential future candidate for speaker. Ocasio-Cortez is 28 years old, of Puerto Rican descent and an avid progressive; Crowley is 56, of Irish descent and has raised 10 times as much as his opponent.

Maryland’s U.S. Senate (D+24) race might even have turned this trio into a quartet if things had unfolded a little differently. Incumbent Ben Cardin is as safe as safe can be, but all eyes will be on how many votes transgender activist and convicted leaker of classified material Chelsea Manning garners in her Democratic primary challenge. By any normal measure (e.g., raising $81,000 for a statewide campaign), she is not running a serious race.","He won a 2015 special election after the previous occupant of the seat, Republican Michael Grimm, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and resigned.

110,110,"Jan 24, 2019",Rutgers-Camden NewsNow,"Rutgers University–Camden Partners with City, Cooper’s Ferry on $1 Million Bloomberg Philanthropies Grant to Transform Illegal Dumping Sites into Art Spaces for Camden Neighborhoods : Rutgers-Camden C","On Jan. 24, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that Camden, New Jersey has been named a Bloomberg Philanthropies 2018 Public Art Challenge winner. The city will receive $1 million for “A New View,” a public art project that will transform sites plagued by illegal dumping along major transit corridors into dynamic art spaces, inspiring residents and attracting visitors. It will include art installations and creative programming at several sites along Camden’s rail, road, and bike routes.

As a lead partner in “A New View,” Rutgers University–Camden will encourage residents to combat illegal dumping of household and or industrial waste through education efforts and public-private partnerships. The city also aims to strengthen the local artistic community and improve the quality of life for Camden residents. Led by the urban redevelopment nonprofit Cooper’s Ferry Partnership and the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts, the collaboration will engage independent curators, the Camden Collaborative Initiative environmental consortium, the Camden City Cultural and Heritage Commission, local businesses, and residents.

Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LP, and mayor of New York City (2001-2013), says, “Public art has the power to bring people together to strengthen their communities. Camden is harnessing that power by transforming dumping sites into works of art along the city’s public transit routes, which will symbolize – and further spur –the city’s ongoing resurgence. I’m glad to congratulate Camden on being a winner of our Public Art Challenge.”

“As an anchor institution in Camden, Rutgers–Camden has always believed in the power of art to heal and strengthen our communities,” says Phoebe A. Haddon, chancellor of Rutgers University–Camden. “For more than 40 years, our Center for the Arts has transformed lives and neighborhoods through our arts education programs for Camden children and our community arts program for Camden residents. We are excited that the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts will work with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the City, and Cooper’s Ferry Partnership in curating and developing these lots.”

Sites will include illegal dumping locations along the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) high-speed line, RiverLine light rail, and the Camden GreenWay trail network. Art installations and events along these routes will repurpose the sites as active spaces for the city. By visiting the art works along the trails, residents and commuters will experience Camden’s riverfront, neighborhoods, and communities in a new light.

Mayor Francisco Moran says, “Illegal dumping is unsightly, unlawful, and costs the city over $4 million annually. This winning project provides a unique way to bring together residents and artists to address this issue with creativity and create a brighter future for Camden. I have made solving this problem the cornerstone of my administration.”

The City and Cooper’s Ferry Partnership have long been working to address illegal dumping through the Camden Collaborative Initiative and Connect the Lots. Through Connect the Lots, a variety of artistic and cultural outdoor activities have been designed to engage residents and activate vacant and underutilized spaces in Camden neighborhoods.

“This funding will allow Camden’s best and brightest artists, curators, and community-builders to come together to beautify highly visible areas of the city. ‘A New View’ will shine light on important urban issues, and strengthen our neighborhoods and tourism sector,” says Kris Kolluri, president and CEO of Cooper’s Ferry Partnership. “We can’t thank them enough for this opportunity.”

About the Public Art Challenge:

In February 2018, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited mayors of U.S. cities with 30,000 residents or more to submit proposals for temporary public art projects that address important civic issues and demonstrate an ability to generate public-private collaborations, celebrate creativity and urban identity, and strengthen local economies.

More than 200 cities applied for the 2018 Public Art Challenge with proposals reflecting diverse artistic mediums addressing a range of pressing issues and social themes such as community development, environmental sustainability, cultural identity and immigration. Fourteen finalists were announced in July.

Camden is the fifth and final winning city of the Public Art Challenge. In November, Anchorage, Alaska was the first city to be announced as a winner in the second Public Art Challenge for “SEED Lab,” followed by Coral Springs in partnership with Parkland, Florida for “Inspiring Community Healing After Gun Violence: The Power of Art,” Jackson, Mississippi for “Fertile Ground,” and Tulsa, Oklahoma for “The Greenwood Art Project.”

Submissions were evaluated on a number of factors, including their potential viability as dynamic public art projects, impact on civic issues, community engagement strategies, and capacity to establish or strengthen public-private partnerships.

The Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts (RCCA), a distinguished arts organization recognized by the New Jersey State Council of the Arts, provides performances, exhibitions, education programs, and community projects that inspire a full appreciation and enjoyment of the arts. The RCCA creates meaningful opportunities to participate in the arts, advances the central role of the arts in pre-K-12 education, and increases awareness of the arts as essential to cultural, economic, and community vitality.

Bloomberg Philanthropies has a proven track record of supporting creative and innovative public art. Over 400 cities have submitted proposals for consideration in the Public Art Challenge since 2014. The foundation’s inaugural Public Art Challenge catalyzed $13 million for local economies across the four winning regions and illuminated civic issues including economic decline, vacancy, water conservation and police-community relations.","On Jan. 24, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that Camden, New Jersey has been named a Bloomberg Philanthropies 2018 Public Art Challenge winner.

111,111,"Apr 3, 2020",Eos,Finding Natural Solutions to Man-Made Problems in River Deltas,"Decades of research on river deltas identify gaps in our knowledge of delta behavior and the tools required to fill them in.

River deltas are dynamic systems, fed by sediment flows and shaped by tides and wave action over long timescales. They’ve long proved fertile ground for human civilization. Many of the world’s biggest cities are located on river deltas, where easy access to marine transport, fishing, and coastal soils gives them an economic boost. But human activities and climate change have led to the instability of deltas around the globe, threatening the ecosystem services they provide. Reservoirs and demand for sand, for example, have left many deltas starved of sediment: The Nile Delta, the Mississippi Delta, and the Yellow River Delta are all experiencing shoreline erosion as sea level rise, land subsidence, and dwindling sediment supply interact.

Coastal communities have a vested interest in promoting delta resilience, but there’s growing understanding that our conventional and inflexible strategies for managing deltas—including storm surge barriers and river embankments—are unsustainable in the face of climate change. Managers are turning to nature-based solutions, but those solutions require deep knowledge of stable delta behavior. There is almost no place on Earth left undisturbed by human activities, which makes modeling and predicting modern delta behavior all the more challenging. It’s critical to develop natural solutions to contest the challenges deltas face.

Here Hoitink et al. synthesize recent research on river deltas to identify the ways that human activities interact with natural processes to create instability and discuss the tools that researchers can use to better understand those processes and render deltas resilient. The study area spanned the globe, using the best-studied delta systems, such as the Mississippi in the United States, the Rhine-Meuse in the Netherlands, and the Yellow River of China, to inform about process evolution of deltas.

The team identified four main processes revealing delta instability that relate to both natural dynamics and human activities: riverbank failure, channel incision and siltation, river avulsions, and a shift to hyperturbidity. These processes take place over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Riverbank failure, or a dredging-induced hyperconcentration of suspended sediment, can occur over relatively short timescales (years to decades), whereas channel bed erosion and the formation of a new deltaic landscape may require centuries.

The authors call for the development and improvement of a host of analysis tools to better understand these complex processes, including numerical modeling, network and dynamic system theory, and direct and continuous observations. Empirical data sets on the behavior of past and present river delta systems can help inform predictions of delta behavior in the future.

The major challenges that remain, according to the authors, are determining the annual sediment balance, predicting the impacts of dwindling sediment supply and sea level rise, and combining approaches to monitoring and modeling river deltas to optimize our understanding of river delta resilience in our rapidly changing world.

UL Monroe finished 5-7, and Grambling — by its own high standards — had a down year at 6-5.

But McNeese also finished above .500 at 7-5, and fellow FCS members Nicholls and Southeastern Louisiana both won first-round FCS playoffs games.

What’s behind it all?

“I think it’s that Louisiana water,” Ragin’ Cajuns senior safety Deuce Wallace said.

But is it simply runoff from fertile recruiting ground in the state — and surrounding areas including Texas and Mississippi — or is there more to it than that?

“First of all, I think we’ve got some exceptional coaches in the state,” Cajuns coach Billy Napier said in Mobile a few days before UL’s LendingTree Bowl win. “You’ve got to give all these coaches that have had good years (credit).

“And some maybe didn’t have quite as good a year this year, but they’ve had terrific programs.”

Then there’s that recruiting angle.

“I do think we all benefit from the proximity of a lot of good high school football players,” Napier said.

“There’s about a hundred Division I players a year in just the state of Louisiana, not to mention this I-10 corridor — East Texas, Houston, the Panhandle (of Florida), south Alabama, south Mississippi.

“So we’re benefiting from proximity,” he added, “and certainly I think the universities and administrations at those schools have committed to having good programs, and those coaches and players have done a terrific job.”

So UL, Louisiana Tech and Tulane did their parts.

Nicholls and Southeastern Louisiana did theirs.

Now it’s up to LSU to close the deal.

The Tigers will try to do so with some who have Ragin’ Cajun ties on their side.

Former UL offensive coordinator Jorge Munoz — an assistant on the staffs of two ex-Cajun coaches, Mark Hudspeth and Rickey Bustle — is now an offensive analyst at LSU.

Munoz has been so instrumental to the success of the Tiger offense this season that quarterback Joe Burrow invited him to New York last month for the 2019 Heisman Trophy ceremony and made sure to mention him in his acceptance speech after winning.

His work has gotten nationwide notice, and in the past few days he was mentioned in multiple reports as a candidate for the vacant offensive coordinator position at Oregon.

Former Cajuns quarterback Blaine Gautier, who led UL to its 2011 New Orleans Bowl win over San Diego State, is an LSU offensive analyst too, and has been for a few years now.

And ex-Cajuns starting offensive lineman Jonathan Decoster coached tight ends in Baton Rouge.

So UL fans have a vested interest in Monday’s title game, like LSU or not.

And if one Cajun is to be believed, there is really is plenty of support for the Tigers even across the interstate in Lafayette.

“Yeah,” Wallace said in Mobile, “we definitely root for those Bayou Bengals down the road, and we’re all rooting for them to finish it off.

“They definitely deserve it.”

Doing it would be one more notch — and the biggest, by far — in the belt of a land with plenty of them this season.

“It’s a great time in this state when it comes to that,” Napier said with reference to Louisiana’s success so far, “and certainly I think there’s a certain level of pride that goes with that, and we’re fortunate to be involved with that.”

Growing your own juicy tomatoes or crisp peppers sounds idyllic. But in practice, backyard farming can be daunting. Many gardeners dealing with pests, weeds and unpredictable weather quickly find themselves questioning whether they are working with nature or against it.

Just ask John and Molly Chester, who bought a sandy, barren plot of land in Southern California eight years ago in the hopes of starting the farm of their dreams. New to farming, the couple relied on holistic, regenerative practices (and a lot of trial and error) to revive Apricot Lane Farms. Through their hard work, the 214 acres are now a lush, largely regenerating ecosystem with fertile soil, diverse animal life and an abundant orchard with well over 75 varieties of fruit trees. Better yet: The farm never uses toxic, synthetically derived pesticides, which can kill soil microorganisms, harm pollinators and other wildlife, pollute waterways and make us sick.

John and Molly Chester

The Chesters' story, recounted in the documentary The Biggest Little Farm, is a testament to the wisdom of nature's own fine-tuned systems — and the remarkable rewards that gardeners will reap if they follow its lead. Here's how to cultivate a bit of Apricot Lane Farms' success in your own backyard.

Feed Your Soil When the Chesters arrived at Apricot Lane Farms, the ground was dry, hard and mostly devoid of life. They knew they'd need to convert dead dirt back into soil before they could grow any crops. ""When it's biologically diverse, soil is like this alchemizer of death into life, but you have to feed it,"" John said. Feeding the soil means building its biota — its below-the-surface ecosystem of microorganisms like bacteria and fungi, which break down decaying organic matter and infuse the soil with nutrients for the next cycle of plant life. If you find yourself with similarly unhealthy soil, the Chesters recommend worm compost tea: worm waste steeped in water to make a liquid fertilizer teeming with beneficial microorganisms. At Apricot Lane Farms, the couple built an entire vermicomposting (worm composting) facility, but you can make do at home. Just put some worm castings, i.e. the black earthy-looking particles in your compost bin (you can also purchase a bag of castings) into a bag made from old panty hose, cheesecloth or a porous T-shirt. Add the tea bag to a pitcher or bucket of water. ""Brew"" your tea by adding a sugar supply like molasses for the bacteria (which will feed and multiply) and a small aerator (like a bubbler you'd add to a fish aquarium), which will concentrate the beneficial aerobic microorganisms. Let it bubble for one to two days, stirring occasionally, until a layer of foam develops — a good sign of active microorganisms. Apply to your soil within 48 hours. (If you'd like more information before brewing your own, step-by-step recipes and video tutorials on making worm tea abound.)

Plant Cover Crops Cultivating native grasses, or simply refraining from ripping out last year's garden plants, will help you maximize the number of living roots in the ground, which offers many benefits to your soil. But by far the best means of nourishing and building up your soil is by planting cover crops. Farmers often plant them after the primary crop has been harvested or in areas that would otherwise be bare. And as John and Molly can attest, they're a critical component of any holistic farming practice. Not only do they protect exposed soil from the baking sun, which can kill critical fungal communities and other important microorganisms, but they also prevent erosion, naturally suppress weeds, improve soil quality, sequester carbon from the atmosphere and minimize flooding.

Cover crops can also enrich your backyard garden. Many gardeners plant them in the fall, in order to protect the soil through the winter and into the spring. Cover crops can also carry nitrogen from the air down into the soil, eventually making it available for the roots of other plants. Come spring, you can then turn these plants into ""green manure"" by mixing them into the soil and letting them decompose, which releases beneficial nutrients. ""Cover crops are protecting this complex universe beneath the ground,"" John said. ""They're also creating soil structure with their roots and increasing oxygen so that you get healthy, aerated soil that is filled with aerobic bacteria instead of anaerobic."" At Apricot Lane Farms, cover crops include a ""cocktail of grasses and legumes,"" though the best species for your backyard will depend on climate and your garden's specific needs, be it weed resistance or soil regeneration. A few common cover crop varieties to investigate: Hairy vetch: This legume is hearty, resilient and a powerful nitrogen fixer. Its long roots also help break up soil.

Buckwheat: Known as a ""smotherer,"" this cover crop will naturally help keep weeds at bay while attracting pollinators. It can then easily be tilled into the soil.

Clover: The many species of this legume are known to be versatile and powerful nitrogen fixers.

Alfalfa: This crop's long roots help aerate and bring up nutrients deep within the soil.

Peas: These legumes taste good, yes, but they also fix nitrogen and crowd out weeds, too.

Marigold: Well known for its vibrant flowers, this plant also naturally controls pests like insects, frogs, fungi and weeds.

Maintain Habitats for Pollinators and Other Native Wildlife Biodiversity rules at Apricot Lane Farms. By planting hundreds of plant species with a wide variety of roles, the Chesters have invited in diverse animal life. ""Think about an ecosystem as the planet's immune system,"" John said. ""You're trying to imitate that biodiversity."" In other words, a diverse ecosystem has better odds of being able to heal itself. Keeping as many pieces as possible of that ecosystem intact provides a natural check on any one plant, animal or disease running amok. Here are some biodiversity boosters for your own backyard: Introduce native flowering species that provide food for visiting pollinators.

Hang a bee nesting box somewhere it can get sunlight and warmth.

Provide green, leafy plants for caterpillars to eat, such as milkweed for the monarch butterfly.

Set up a small wood pile, using brush or old logs, as shelter for lizards, fungi and snakes (the latter can eat other pests, like slugs or rodents).

Plant trees or shrubs that provide plenty of nesting and cover for birds, or set up a bird house.

Add a barn owl box or just a simple roosting perch to a pole. Owls and hawks help with rabbits and gophers.

If you have the space, create a reliable water source in the form of a pond or container garden, which will make your yard more attractive to birds, frogs and dragonflies. Stem the problem of mosquitoes by including goldfish or guppies, which eat the bugs.

Plant a diversity of cover crops. Instead of just using clover, for instance, mix your clover seeds with some hairy vetch, legumes and more to help your soil reap a diversity of benefits.

To Manage Pests, Play Detective, Then Look to Nature to Help Crack the Case Over the years, the Chesters have dealt with everything from snail infestations in the orchard to hungry coyotes picking off their chickens. But the challenges have only made them better problem solvers, says John. He suggests that every gardener facing an intrusion — whether by pest, predator or disease — ask a few questions before attempting to control it, especially through artificial means like pesticides or other harsh chemicals. For starters, understand the source of the problem and what might be fueling it, he says. Then look at what its food is, and in turn what eats it. Finally, ask what conditions it does not like and what conditions benefit its predators. With those answers, you may find a nature-friendly solution. Take slugs, the bane of many a gardener. If they're chomping down on too many of your leafy plants, think first of what could provide a natural check. Toads and beetles will snack on the slugs if given the proper habitat themselves, potentially ridding you of your problem without requiring use of chemical pesticides. You can also address what snails don't like — sharp, rough ground — and put a layer of crushed eggshell around your plants, which act as a natural deterrent. ""You start to frame the complexity and context of the things you're trying to coexist with,"" John said. ""It's not harmony you want,"" he added, but a ""comfortable level of disharmony.""

Indiana's progress in reducing agricultural runoff that's polluting the Mississippi River Basin and causing a ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico has been halted in recent years, and new data reveal that the effort may be stalling in other states.

But Caleb Michalke has found a solution for his family's farm — craft beer.

After Michalke's father harvests his soybeans each fall, he plants barley to hold the soil and fertilizers in place during the winter. The barley then goes into the younger Michalke's malt house, Sugar Creek Malt, which supplies beer brands such as Sun King, 3 Floyds, Upland Brewing and Central State.

It's one example of an economic solution to an entrenched problem plaguing modern agriculture and the environment.

The runoff from bare fields left after corn and soybeans are harvested contributes to toxic algal blooms that appear in Geist Reservoir, and have caused fish kills in places like Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico, where tons of porpoises, manatees, sea turtles and other marine species washed ashore last year. The nutrient laden runoff also contributes to an enormous Gulf ""dead zone,"" where low oxygen levels compromise the marine habitat.

Planting fall crops can help

A key part of the solution is cover crops. In Indiana, some farmers plant crops such as barley, rye and turnips in the fall, to keep soil and chemicals from washing into waterways after cash crops such as corn and soybeans are harvested. The practice grew more than 500 percent between 2011 and 2015. Then by 2017, the practice had dipped by 18 percent, according to data from the Indiana Natural Resource Conservation Service.

Now, two other states are also showing signs of slowing progress. Iowa and Illinois increased cover crop use by hundreds of thousands of acres between 2015 and 2017, doubling the prevalence of cover crops in each state, according to satellite data recently released by the D.C.-based Environmental Working Group.

But several counties across all three states appear to have lost cover crop acres in the same time span.

Exactly why the practice is declining is unknown, but some cite economic uncertainty in agriculture.

And now agricultural officials are looking for ways to revive that interest.

Millions of taxpayer dollars are subsidizing cover crops, but widespread adoption remains elusive. Only about 11 percent of Indiana's farmland was sown with cover crops at its peak in 2015. That dropped to about 8 percent in 2017. More than 90 percent of the farm acres in Indiana, Iowa or Illinois did not get planted with cover crops that year.

Yet the benefits can be huge. Cover crops, planted late in the season, hold soil in place and prevent fertilizer runoff. In Indiana in 2017, they helped keep roughly 5.5 million pounds of pollutants out of Indiana's waterways, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

Conservationists also stress that there are long-term financial benefits to cover crops, but in the short term, the practice is an added cost with a steep learning curve. During financially stressful years, some farmers have a difficult time justifying the expense to plant a crop they ultimately kill and cannot sell.

“I think it’s pretty amazing they doubled the footprint,” Soren Rundquist, EWG's spatial analysis director and study coordinator, said of Iowa. “But the sobering reality is that 1 million acres is just a drop in the bucket.”

There are many reasons why farmers might stop planting cover crops or be apprehensive to try, said Shannon Zezula, state resource conservationist at the Indiana Natural Resources Conservation Service. The practice can be costly, both in time and money. During hard years, farmers may choose to forgo the expense.

Steve Berger, an Iowa farmer who has been growing cover crops on his farm since the 1990s, doesn’t know why cover crop acres in his county fell off in 2017.

But low commodity prices and tariff concerns may have taken a toll on local cover crop acres, Berger said.

“When there are too many challenges, cover crops will be the first things to go,” Berger said.

The struggle to expand cover crop use has some farmers and experts wondering if it would be better to encourage cover crops that can be harvested for a profit.

""We are not giving up on this,"" Zezula said. ""We know we’re onto something.""

Putting his love of beer to work

That's where Michalke comes in. Across the Midwest, farmers plant barley as a cover crop, sowing the seeds in the fall after the corn or soybean crop. When spring comes, they'll kill the barley before sowing their next cash crop.

Things are different on Michalke's family farm, where the barley is harvested and used in malt that goes into beer.

Michalke didn't get into barley for the soil and water benefits — his main interest was to create a business that melds his agricultural background with his interest in brewing. But on bad years, he's thankful to have the barley in the ground, even if the grain crop goes sour.

“That’s the nice thing about barley,” he said. “This winter for instance. We lost everything this winter but at least we have a cover crop.”

Michalke's product is niche — his malt house can process between 200 and 300 acres worth of barley per year. That's no solution in a state with 14 million acres of farmland.

But conservationists hope that more farmers will find opportunities to turn a profit on their cover crops.

Terry Ward, a farmer in northeastern Iowa, plans to harvest a rye crop in June and turn it into food for 125 heifers he feeds for a local dairy farmer. Once the rye is gone, Ward will sow soybeans, a practice known as double cropping because he gets two crops from the same land in one year.

“We think it’s cost effective because we get a year’s worth of feed and a crop besides,” Ward said. “We had 51 bushels per acre (of soybeans) last year, which we think is pretty good.”

Karyl Fritsche, a district conservationist at the Prairie du Chien office in Wisconsin, wants to see cover crops as part of farmers' bottom lines.

Fritsche is located in the ""driftless region"" of Wisconsin, an area untouched by glaciers and where farmers cultivate steeper slopes. The region's fertile soil blows in from Iowa.

""It’s a pretty fragile soil, so we worry an awful lot,” she said.

Crop rotation provides immediate benefit

Fritsche is working on a project to experiment with farmers adding a third crop to their corn-soybean rotations. In this scenario, farmers plant winter wheat after harvesting their soybeans in the second year. The wheat acts as cover and then is harvested in the spring.

Crop rotation is nothing new, but it's largely fallen out of practice in modern agriculture. Farms in Indiana largely alternate between corn and soybeans each summer. Adding a winter cover crop brings some of the benefits of a more varied crop rotation, but Fritsche said that adding a third cash crop such as wheat can actually enhance the benefits of cover crops.

“If we start adjusting our crop rotations, and I’ve done that, you see a much more immediate benefit,"" she said.

Identifying market-based incentives to reduce nutrient runoff has become a priority for federal agencies. In December, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that they would be renewing a joint effort to find ways to reduce nutrient runoff without regulation.

Since then, the EPA signed a memorandum of understanding with the Water Research Foundation to research and identify ""innovative approaches"" to preventing nutrient runoff. The federal agencies have also been meeting with their state-level counterparts over the last several months, according to Ken Labbe, a spokesman for the EPA.

Water quality also got a nod in the 2018 Farm Bill, which now directs USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to prioritize practices that have a direct impact on improving water quality. (Zezula said that his department is waiting for further interpretation of the Farm Bill.)

Wisconsin's Fritsche, however, hopes that creating new markets for the crops that create healthy water and soil will help farmers make good environmental choices without a government incentive.

""We don’t have to offer a government payment if the cash flows,"" she said.

116,116,"Nov 21, 2019",EducationNext,New Jersey Enforces Its Amistad Law,"The state of New Jersey is taking a major step to ensure that all students learn about the history of enslavement and its impact on our nation’s development. Governor Phil Murphy announced that public school teachers will get to travel to sites associated with the slave trade to learn how to better teach black history throughout the entire school year.

The initiative will help schools to comply with the state’s Amistad law, which requires all public schools to teach African American history. The Amistad law, named for the slave ship that was the subject of a 1997 Steven Spielberg film, was signed in 2002 but it has not been widely implemented. That changed this school year with Education Commissioner Lamont O. Repollet’s goal of ensuring that districts follow the law. If districts are not following the law, they can lose points on their state evaluation.

Few states, if any, have similar requirements. Along with New Jersey, those states include Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, New York and Rhode Island. In Florida, state law requires that black history be infused in its curricula but, as has been the case in New Jersey, it is not being done. In Pennsylvania, only the Philadelphia school district requires a course on black history and the Civil Rights movement for graduation from high school.

States and districts differ in their approaches to teaching about enslavement or black history. In their official standards for teaching social studies and history, some states explicitly call for teaching about aspects of slavery throughout a student’s K-12 education, while others refer to it in passing or not at all.

New Jersey’s commitment to teaching this subject properly matters in light of what is known about variation in how schools approach the topic. School board members in Southern states have scrutinized how textbooks tackle the issue, which can also make students and teachers uncomfortable.

When I became a social studies teacher, I felt that it was my duty to teach the untold history of enslavement in the United States and New Jersey in particular. Most of this untold history I myself didn’t learn until I arrived on a college campus.

I remember the sanitized and minimized history lessons I received on African enslavement. In fourth grade, I learned about the history of New Jersey. However, New Jersey’s history of enslavement and opposition to emancipation was left out. I wasn’t taught about the resistance of the enslaved or the various rebellions of the enslaved. I wasn’t taught the evil and sinful nature of the peculiar institution.

Some worry that “adding” more material about slavery to the history curriculum will push other things overboard. I remember being baffled at having to teach 300 years’ to 400 years’ worth of events in 8 to 10 months. While school districts have the freedom to choose going either the chronological or thematic route when teaching history, the traditional way to teach history is going the chronological route. I did that my first year of teaching. But I quickly switched to a thematic approach because it allowed me to cover black history as American history while looking at critical moments in our nation’s history such as war and conflict, enslavement, displacement, and Reconstruction.

Another concern is that excessive focus on enslavement in America would encourage black students to think of themselves as victims. But teaching slavery well includes telling stories of black characters not only passively being acted upon but also serving as protagonists in liberation, emancipation, and abolition.

Slavery’s role in American history recently received a new burst of attention resulting from the 1619 Project undertaken by the New York Times.

New Jersey is particularly fertile ground for slavery education. Slavery persisted in New Jersey longer than elsewhere in the North; when an emancipation law was passed in 1804, it went into effect only gradually. Abraham Lincoln lost New Jersey in the elections of 1860 and 1864; it was the only northern state to vote against Lincoln. In 1863, the legislature opposed emancipation of those who remained enslaved. In 1865, the state legislature wouldn’t ratify the 13th amendment. In 1866, the state legislature rescinded ratification of the 14th amendment and rejected the 15th amendment.

This is just some of the history that New Jersey students will learn with the support of the Amistad Commission and enforcement by the New Jersey Department of Education. History teachers must be provided with the professional development and mentorship purposed to equip them with the historical knowledge, the pedagogical tools to teach it and a culturally competent philosophy to guide their daily practice in the classroom. Because equally as important as it is to teach our history is that we teach it properly and courageously with power and conviction.

Mississippi on Tuesday morning had 21 reported cases of new coronavirus, according to the state Department of Health.

New cases have been reported in Harrison, Hinds, Jackson and Leflore counties.

There were four additional cases in Hinds, raising the total in the county to six.

Leflore County now has three cases, up from one reported on Sunday.

Jackson County now has its first case.

Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, meanwhile, reported an additional case in Harrison County that is not being reported by the Health Department.

The Mississippi Health Department on Wednesday reported the state's first presumptive case of the novel coronavirus.

As of Tuesday morning, the department listed that 389 people have been tested. Also, a case previously reported as being in Pearl River County was from Hancock County, the department reported.

Gulfport Memorial reports cases in Harrison County

Kent Nicaud, CEO of Memorial in Gulfport, announced Tuesday that two cases had been confirmed by the Health Department, making them the first in Harrison County to be identified.

Per CDC guidelines, the patients were isolated, the hospital said in a release. The individuals were not hospitalized and were never inpatients at either Memorial or Stone County campuses. Each patient is at home recovering, self-quarantined.

Nicaud sais: “The patients felt ill and sought treatment early, which we have educated the community to do. They visited our clinics where our staff followed the CDC guidelines for suspected COVID-19 patients by isolating each quickly, taking samples safely and working with our state agencies for a diagnosis. The process worked. The patients are home and we are in contact with them to aid in their recovery. We expect to see more COVID-19 cases in our community and within our health care system.”

State of emergency declared

On Monday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced two executive orders that will activate the National Guard to keep health care workers safe at testing centers being set up across the state, send all non-essential state workers home, require schools to set up ""distance learning"" and continue to offer students free and reduced lunches.

Reeves said any state or local government employees that miss work due to the outbreak will receive paid leave.

Mississippi coronavirus: What state employees need to know

He said he hopes that businesses will follow the state's example in sending employees home and offering them paid leave.

Reeves also announced the closing of Mississippi casinos.

The biggest risk is that coronavirus cases in Mississippi overwhelm the health care system. He urged people to wash their hands and practice good hygiene.

""Be smart, be safe. Because, the reality is, while you may be healthy, this is about protecting Mississippi's most vulnerable. Even if you are healthy you are still need to protect your friends and your neighbors,"" Reeves said.

Reeves stressed the seriousness of the crisis. He said the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency considers the virus a ""level one"" disaster, which hasn't been seen since Hurricane Katrina.

Over the weekend, Reeves declared a state of emergency for Mississippi.

On Tuesday, the Mississippi Secretary of State's office announced it would close temporarily to help prevent the spread of the virus. The office will be closed until further notice.

Office staff will continue to respond to emails, answer calls and guide people through online resources, a news release said.

“We care deeply about the health and safety of all Mississippians, as well as our staff,” said Secretary of State Michael Watson. “Our mission is to provide the highest level of customer service, and that effort will continue during this unique and challenging time.”

Reeves warned Mississippians to avoid any large gatherings, including church services Sunday, and to ""use caution"" and not panic. Reeves also asked for Mississippi schools to close for at least a week. Most were on spring break last week. Dozens of school districts have announced additional closure plans, with some announcing closures of two weeks, including Madison and Rankin districts.

MSU, USM postponing graduation

Two of the state's largest universities said they planned on postponing graduation ceremonies in light of the possible spread of the virus.

Mississippi State University announced Tuesday afternoon the school plans to offer online courses for the remainder of the spring semester. It will also postpone graduation.

The university said in a news release that plans to honor MSU graduates will be discussed and revealed when the national emergency is concluded.

""Commencement is one of MSU’s most meaningful and cherished traditions, one that our students and their families have earned. As an institution, MSU remains committed to celebrating our graduates at a safe and appropriate time,"" the release said.

The University of Southern Mississippi posted to social media a similar message.

The university said graduation will not be held in May and that it is unlikely it will be held prior to the latter part of the summer, given the ongoing evolution of COVID-19.

""We are working as quickly as possible to identify an alternate date,"" the university said.

USM Commencement ceremonies will not be held in May. We understand that participating in Commencement is a very important tradition for graduating students and their families. We are working as quickly as possible to identify an alternate date. — Southern Miss (@SouthernMiss) March 17, 2020

Non-essential government employees sent home

Reeves said Monday all non-essential state and local government employees will be sent home. It will be up to agencies to determine which employees are non-essential.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said non-essential Jackson city offices and government leased buildings will be closed and non-essential city employees will be required to work remotely. The Water and Sewer Business Administration will remain open.

Jatran buses are being cleaned nightly, Lumumba said, and drivers are being provided personal hygiene supplies. Residents should use online city services as much as possible.

All non-essential Hinds County employees will leave work at 5 p.m. Monday and not return until after March 30, Hinds County supervisors announced at a press conference Monday afternoon. All employees will be paid during the time off, said board president Robert Graham. It was not immediately known if the affected employees would lose sick days due to the break.

While non-essential employees will also be sent home from the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department, deputies will continue to patrol. Of those deputies, Sheriff Lee Vance said, “there’s nothing we can do to keep them absolutely safe, it’s basically the nature of the business.”

Visitation at the Raymond Jail has been limited to attorneys only until March 30, Vance said.

County offices, including justice court, will remain open, Graham said.

Graham said the reason for the March 30 date was because it’s “past the 14 day isolation period.” Surrounded by almost a dozen county officials in a room with approximately 35 people, Graham noted that earlier in the day the CDC recommended limiting gatherings to 10 people.

Graham said, to his knowledge, no county employees had called in sick due to coronavirus symptoms.

More COVID-19 cases reported

The Health Department on Friday confirmed two additional cases of the virus, a man and a woman, in Forrest County. The department has since stopped providing any details on patients.

One involves a woman over the age of 65, which is among the high risk demographics, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The department said in a news release that she had recently traveled to North Carolina.

Another reported case involves a woman in LeFlore County. She is self-isolating at home. Sunday's additional cases included one in Copiah County, two in Hinds County and one in Pearl River County.

One case identified in worker at North Mississippi plant

An employee at the Tronox plant in Hamilton has been identified as one of the Mississippians who has tested positive for the coronavirus. Any employees who had close contact with that person have been sent home and are self-monitoring, according to WTVA.

""The employee reported to the site medical suite with a fever on Wednesday, March 11 and was promptly sent home,"" Tronox Senior Vice President Melissa Zona told the station. ""The individual subsequently has been hospitalized and is currently undergoing treatment.""

The company decontaminated both the medical suite and the employee's work area, the station reported.

Health Department manning coronavirus hotline

The state Health Department has setup a coronavirus hotline to take questions from the public and healthcare workers.

The department said it has increased lines and staffing and also plans to extend hotline hours. It is currently available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The number is 877-978-6453.

Meals provided

Some metro area school district are providing lunches for area students despite being closed.

Jackson Public Schools, in partnership with the Mississippi Food Network, will serve grab-and-go breakfast and lunch meals during school closures. Children 18 years and under will be able to pick up breakfast and lunch at no cost. They do not have to be a student.

Adult meals are $2.50 for breakfast and $3.75 for lunch. Meals will be served from 9 to 11 a.m., March 18 to March 20 and March 23 to March 27.

The district will also distribute family food boxes with shelf-stable pantry items and fresh and frozen foods. The boxes will provide a family of 4 to 5 with enough supplemental meals to last for several days.

The meals will be provided at the following schools:

Boyd Elementary, 4531 Broadmeadow St.

North Jackson Elementary, 650 James M. Davis Drive

Spann Elementary, 1615 Brecon Drive

Wilkins Elementary, 1970 Castle Hill Drive

The Rankin County School District posted on social media Sunday night that it would be providing ""grab and go"" lunches for free for any child 18 and under. While the student must be present to get a lunch, they do not have to be a student in the Rankin County School District.

Starting Tuesday, the lunches will be handed out at three schools via a drive thru line with more locations expected to be added. Parents can also purchase a lunch for $3.50. First responders in uniform can pick up a lunch for free.

Lunches can be picked up from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at McLaurin Elementary, Richland Upper Elementary and Pelahatchie Elementary.

The school district announced Saturday that schools would be closed though Friday, March 127.

In a separate effort, volunteers are providing a drop-off meal service for Jackson families in need, the People’s Advocacy Institute announced. Several organizations are partnering to provide breakfast and dinner for families through schools’ extended breaks. Meal drop-off operations are being guided by healthcare professionals, the release said, and volunteers will minimize one-on-one contact and group gatherings.

Call or text (615) 946-4197 to set up a meal drop-off location and time. The mobile meal hotline is being monitored 24 hours a day, according to the release.

Clinic opens to treat, test symptomatic people

A new Cough and Fever Clinic opening Wednesday at Hattiesburg Clinic's Cloverleaf Immediate Care facility will hopefully reduce the spread of new coronavirus and help those who may have symptoms of the disease without the worry of infecting others around them.

The clinic will be at Cloverleaf Medical Plaza, 5909 U.S. 49, in Hattiesburg.

Dr. Bryan Batson of Hattiesburg Clinic said the Cough and Fever Clinic will take walk-ins, but it is recommended that if people have questions about their symptoms to first contact their primary health care providers.

People without a primary care physician and those without insurance may also come to the clinic to be examined and if need be, tested. No one will be turned away for inability to pay.

Batson said people should not visit the clinic if they do not have symptoms, which include fever, a cough, runny nose, sore throat or in some cases difficulty breathing.

Dr. Rambod Rouhbakhsh with Forrest General Hospital said if the model is successful, other areas of the state might soon be developing similar facilities

Beware of scams, Attorney General warns

Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch urged people to be vigilant about scams and frauds during the emergency.

In a news release, Fitch’s office provided tips on how to protect yourself from scams:

Use trusted and official sources. Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website for information about the virus.

Don’t let anyone rush you into donating. Exercise caution when someone asks for donations in cash, gift card or money transfers. Check the Federal Trade Commission’s website for advice on how to donate wisely.

If you think you see price gouging then take a photo, including a time and date stamp of the price signs.

People who think they have been scammed during the coronavirus outbreak can contact the attorney general’s Consumer Protection Division at (601) 359-4230 or (800) 281-4418.

Fitch said in a statement: ""Emergencies bring out the best in some people, but sometimes they bring out the worst, too. It is important to remember there are people who are looking to take advantage of this time of uncertainty. If you suspect that someone is unfairly raising their prices to take advantage of the outbreak, you may be able to do something about it and our consumer protection team is ready to assist you with your questions.""

State universities switching to online courses

Mississippi's eight public universities will extend spring break a week, then switch to online classes, to inhibit the spread of coronavirus.

The state College Board made the announcement Thursday that universities would change their schedules for spring semester classes.

""The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff are paramount,"" Alfred Rankins Jr., Commissioner of Higher Education, said in a statement.

All eight universities are observing Spring Break this week or next and will extend the break an additional week to allow faculty members time to prepare to offer classes remotely.

Event cancellations in Capital City

On Monday, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced that gatherings of 50 or more people are now prohibited.

Other events across the state were being canceled, as state officials urged people not to have any events or gatherings with large numbers of people, including church services.

Out of an abundance of caution, Lumumba said, the city has postponed several events, including Tech JXN and the Fertile Grounds Expo.

Malls in metro to adjust hours

Northpark Mall announced on Tuesday that it would adjusting store hours beginning on Wednesday.

The new hours will be Monday-Thursday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Sundays from 12 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The food court will remain open and offer a pickup option and delivery services for customers.

Sporting events canceled

The NCAA announced Thursday that it has canceled its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments amid growing coronavirus concerns. The Mississippi State women's basketball team was a lock to be selected to participate and the men's team had a chance to make the field.

The Southwestern Athletic Conference canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments in Alabama, where both Jackson State basketball teams were scheduled to participate Friday.

The Southeastern Conference suspended all on-campus sporting events between March 13 and at least March 30 and also stopped the men's basketball tournament in Nashville, Tennessee.

Conference USA, the conference Southern Miss belongs to, also announced Thursday a suspension of all spring sports competition, effective immediately, until further notice.

Wildlife department closures

The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks announced business changes effective Tuesday morning until March 31.

State and regional offices will be closed to the public.

State lakes will remain open for those that wish to go fishing; however, state fishing lake offices and bath houses will be closed.

State parks’ bath houses and primitive camping areas will be closed; however, RV camping will remain open.

The Museum of Natural Science and the North Mississippi Visitor Education Center will be closed to the public.

MDWFP shooting facilities, Turcotte, McHenry, and McIvor will remain open; however, tournaments and events are canceled.

Purchases of hunting and fishing license or permits are also available at www.mdwfp.com, the MDWFP Hunting and Fishing Mobile App, local agent locations, or by calling 1-800-5-GO-HUNT.

Mississippi, federal court system changes

The Mississippi Supreme Court issued an order Sunday outlining changes due to coronavirus. All courts will remain open, but individual judges have the discretion to postpone any trials on their own docket scheduled through May 15, 2020. Courts shall not conduct any proceedings that require witnesses or parties to travel from an infected area or that involve vulnerable persons, according to the high court.

No more than 50 people are allowed in a courtroom at a given time, changing from the previously limited 200. Access to trials is limited to judges, attorneys, witnesses, security and other necessary people.

Jury summonses may not be sent to jurors which would be returnable to any date prior to May 18, 2020.

Through March 31, all non-essential civil and criminal cases set for a hearing or trial in any federal courthouse in the Southern District of Mississippi have been postponed.

However, Chief Judge Dan Jordan said initial appearance, arraignments, detention hearings, and issuance of warrants are essential, therefore, they will go on as scheduled.

It will be up to the presiding judge to determine during the period if any other court matter is essential and should go forward or whether the matter can be conducted via videoconference or telephone, Jordan said.

In the Northern District, all proceedings, civil and criminal, scheduled or typically undertaken in person should be continued or conducted by video or telephone conference to every extent possible, said Chief Judge Sharrion Aycock.

118,118,"Apr 13, 2020",Natural Resources Defense Council,"As Sea Level Rise Threatens Their Ancestral Village, a Louisiana Tribe Fights to Stay Put","Ten years ago, as news of the BP oil disaster reached Louisiana’s Grand Bayou Indian Village, Rosina Philippe dispatched her brother Maurice Phillips on a reconnaissance mission. Phillips pointed his flatboat toward the Gulf of Mexico and motored through a series of canals and inlets until he reached a fertile fishing ground called Bay Jimmy, eight miles from home. He returned with a passenger: a brown pelican, alive but slathered in petroleum.

Philippe and her brother belong to the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe. They live in their ancestral village, an hour’s drive south of New Orleans near the town of Port Sulphur. Most of the tribe’s estimated 400 members live elsewhere, but a remnant remains in Grand Bayou, a community that has shrunk over the years as its land has slowly slipped into the surrounding waters. The village consists of 14 homes and a nondenominational church. Surrounded by water, most of the buildings sit atop wooden pilings, and there are no roads to connect them. The houses line the bayou and can be reached only by boat.

For generations, the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha have relied on the fertility of the Mississippi River Delta. They catch seafood and forage for wild celery, green onions, and a leafy green called morelle noire. They used to forage for persimmons, too. They trapped muskrats, packing the meat in salt and preserving it in oak barrels. They hunted for deer and rabbits—and still hunt ducks—and grew vegetables in large backyard gardens. In recent decades, however, these resources have contracted. The tribe has withstood one environmental assault after another, standing its ground in a disappearing wetland.

As they scrambled to save the pelican (which they later turned over to a wildlife rescue center), Phillips told his sister that he saw other oiled birds but could wrangle only that one onto his boat. What’s more, Bay Jimmy was covered in thick, gooey crude. Nearly two months after the April 2010 disaster, then governor Bobby Jindal visited the same bay and declared that BP’s oil was “killing the marsh.”

The Deepwater Horizon explosion and resulting 87-day oil spill proved catastrophic for Grand Bayou. The community had just rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the area in 2005, and residents had returned in time for the 2010 commercial shrimping season. “A lot of guys, what little bit of cash they had, they invested into making repairs on their boats because they envisioned the seafood to come,” says Philippe, a tribal elder. The springtime waters brimmed with shrimp. “So, it was almost like the anticipation of Christmas morning.”

Except that Christmas never came. The oil spewing from BP’s open well about 5,000 feet below the Gulf’s surface shut down the nearby fisheries for months. Grand Bayou’s fleet remained docked long after officials insisted that Gulf seafood posed no health risk. The fishermen didn’t agree. “As long as they believed that it was unsafe to eat,” Philippe says, “they refused to go out and catch it, even though they were in dire straits financially.”

Now, with the 10th anniversary of the explosion approaching next week, the tribe is clear on two points. First, the BP disaster cannot be viewed in a vacuum. It is part of a litany of stresses that Grand Bayou has survived for decades, including the loss of more than 5,000 acres of fertile Delta land. And, second: They have no plans to leave.

“We’re resilient,” says Carmalita Sylve, who grew up in Grand Bayou, moved to Colorado after Hurricane Katrina, and returned to a rebuilt home in 2009. From the tribe’s mainland headquarters, she gestures outside toward a grass-lined bank where boats dock and neighbors come to fish. “It’s like this grass out here. You smoosh it down, but you know what? It will come right back. And that’s how we are. You think that you’re going to just overcome us with the different ways. But we’ll adapt.”

Fateful Omissions

The threats faced by the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha reflect, and amplify, what’s happening in vulnerable communities all along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. Since the 1930s, about 2,000 square miles—more than 10 times the land area of sprawling New Orleans—have disappeared from the state’s coastline. Grand Bayou lies outside the protection of the state’s levee system. It lies outside the planning loop, too: The tribe was not formally consulted when the state developed its most recent master plan for coastal restoration.

That $50 billion plan, published in 2017, is essentially a detailed wish list. At its core are large engineering projects like pipelines to pump sediment into degraded wetlands in order to elevate the land and restore the marshes. “What is in the plan is not necessarily funded,” says Stuart Brown, who oversees the plan’s development at the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA). Rather, he says, it’s a “prioritization effort.”

The master plan also lays out risk-reduction strategies for communities facing increased flooding. Depending on the projected flood levels and the type of building, it recommends one of three alternatives: floodproofing, elevation, or “voluntary acquisition.”

Nothing in the plan explicitly calls for the tribe’s, or anyone’s, relocation. But neither does it offer resources or a long-term vision for Grand Bayou to remain an intact village as the surrounding wetlands continue to erode. Members of the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha say they feel a tacit, and sometimes explicit, pressure to plan a future elsewhere.

That pressure, elders say, fails to consider the tribe’s connection to the bayou. It is so ancient, so sacred, that any discussion of resettlement evokes comparisons to the Trail of Tears. Grand Bayou predates the oil companies and the levee builders; predates the refineries and borrow pits that line the nearby highway; predates Louisiana statehood. The prospect of leaving feels, to them, like cultural erasure.

Place Markers

Last year a group of scientists, public officials, lawyers, and coastal residents met in New York City at a conference organized by Columbia University’s Earth Institute to discuss “managed retreat,” an idea that has gained traction in planning circles. The notion is that life along certain coastlines has grown untenable and that orderly relocation is the logical solution.

A handful of U.S. communities have already confronted the decision. After the 1993 Mississippi River floods inundated Valmeyer, Illinois, residents voted to rebuild their town 1.5 miles to the east and 400 feet up a bluff. Shishmaref, Alaska, an Iñpuiat village on a barrier island that is eroding from melting permafrost and sea ice, is currently waiting on federal funds to move to the mainland. (According to PRI’s The World, climate-change denialism has held up the money.)

Closer to home, the planned resettlement of Louisiana’s Isle de Jean Charles Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe, whose ancestral island has nearly disappeared, has been mired in a conflict over tribal sovereignty. The tribe’s leaders say they’re not being treated as co-collaborators—in fact, they learned about the state’s purchase of land for resettlement by reading a press release. State officials say they have tried to work with those leaders but are “not in a legal position” to acknowledge the sovereignty of a tribe that is not federally recognized.

Valmeyer, Shishmaref, and Isle de Jean Charles could be the vanguard of something bigger. The U.S. government’s 2018 National Climate Assessment envisioned the future relocation of “millions of people” as retreat from rising seas becomes an “unavoidable option.”

“That’s what the people in Miami are facing. That’s what I’m facing in New Orleans,” says Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy. Climate change, he says, will make some places uninhabitable, even if residents want to stay. “Sooner or later, they are going to be dealt a hand they cannot play.”

Among those attending the Columbia conference were representatives of four Louisiana tribes, who spoke together on a panel. Rosina Philippe was among them. Fewer phrases pique the Grand Bayou elder faster than “managed retreat.” Given the arc of U.S. history, she worries that it’s the rebranding of an old policy: making life-altering decisions about communities without their participation or consent.

“They’re couching it in such agreeable terms. ‘Managed retreat.’ Well, managed by whom?” Philippe asks. “We’ve seen so many instances of other people looking at indigenous populations and deciding they should go there, or they can’t go there, and thinking that they were doing the right thing. And we learn through the historic context that it was to the tribe’s detriment. But yet they continue to not learn from the past mistakes.”

To understand the depth of this sentiment, one must understand the value of place in Grand Bayou, where money is scarce but biological and social capital are ample. That sense of abundance stems from an era, within the memory of elders, when the village had dozens of households and looked very different.

“You see water back here, but all of this was ground,” says Carmalita Sylve.

“High ground,” says Philippe.

“You could walk probably just about almost to the Gulf of Mexico,” says Sylve.

When Sylve and Philippe were children, houses had yards, and there was enough land to raise goats and plant peach orchards. The wetlands provided nurseries for fish and shellfish. Add to that the game and foraged plants, and there was little reason to visit the mainland other than for staples like rice and flour.

Here, self-sufficiency meant interdependence. If someone’s bulkhead had loose planks, there would be an announcement at one of the tribe’s regular gatherings or from the pulpit at church. Neighbors would then make plans to fix it. Without ready access to physicians, even health care was a communal effort. The tribe had traiteurs, traditional healers, who used medicinal plants from the marshlands. Older residents talk about “making the veillée,” or holding vigil, at the home of sick neighbors: cooking, cleaning, and brewing coffee so the immediate relatives didn’t have to.

With a social fabric so deeply tied to the wetlands, it’s hard to separate identity from geography. “It’s like we’ve incorporated our very DNA into what’s around us in the land, the air, the water, the other life forms that share the space with us,” says Philippe. “We see ourselves as having our pail full because we have the history of cohabitation, the history of the knowledge of place, of belonging.” Leaving, she says, would upend that relationship. “We would be somewhere else, in a different place with an empty pail. And that’s a feeling almost like a death, like a bereftness.”

The fact that most of the tribe has already left doesn’t diminish that feeling. Loved ones return and pack their relatives’ houses for holidays, summer vacations, and biennial tribal reunions. Some own land in the village. “My grandkids, even though they were born in Tennessee, they claim Grand Bayou as their heritage,” says Geraldine Phillips Ancar, the village’s oldest resident. Ancar, who is in her eighties, co-pastors Grand Bayou’s Light Tabernacle Church with her husband, Bennie. When their youngest grandson, a U.S. Marine, comes to visit, he spends entire days exploring and photographing the wetlands.

Those who stay feel responsible for maintaining the village for the diaspora. “We’re like place markers on the table,” Philippe says, “waiting for everybody else to come and dine.”

Defeats of Engineering

About a decade ago, when he was working on his Ph.D. at the University of New Orleans, Matthew Bethel collaborated with Grand Bayou residents to map the 27-square-mile “livelihood base” where they fished, trapped, and hunted. He studied aerial photos and quantified the landscape changes over four decades.

Bethel calculated a net land loss of 5,449 acres—the shedding of vast productive habitat even before the BP spill soiled so much of what remained. In 1968 there were 2.62 land acres for every water acre. By 2009 that had fallen to 0.48 land acres. Bethel, now the associate executive director of research at Louisiana Sea Grant, published his findings in 2011 in the Journal of Coastal Research.

These losses, all along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, are the cumulative byproduct of humanity’s attempts to engineer the land. Starting in the 1930s, the state’s oil and gas industry cut 10,000 miles of canals into the Mississippi River Delta to transport drilling equipment and lay pipelines. Scientists say the canals destroy wetlands by funneling saltwater into freshwater marshes. That, in turn, kills the freshwater plants whose roots hold the land together. The “spoil banks,” piles of dredged material that run parallel to the canals, also interfere with the natural water flow. In addition, the leveeing of the Mississippi River, particularly after the Great Flood of 1927, has blocked sediment-rich water from overtopping the riverbank during floods. The levees impede the natural process of rebuilding wetlands as they subside, or sink.

There are other causes of land loss, too, including oil from the BP spill, which harmed root systems, and hurricanes. As the climate continues to change, scientists expect sea level rise to increase exponentially, compounding the problem. According to the state’s master plan, sea level rise on the Louisiana Gulf Coast could exceed six feet by 2100.

In Grand Bayou, Philippe says the phrase “land loss” underplays the damage. “That’s habitat loss,” she says. “Those are the nursery for the young shrimp and for the animals around us.” The wetlands also offer protection from storms. As they disappear, communities become more vulnerable. Some people leave for safer harbors.

When Hurricane Katrina hit, Grand Bayou residents hunkered down in boats near the small city of Belle Chasse. They stayed for months, cooking and doing laundry together. It took almost five years to reconstruct their homes with the help of church and community-development groups. By the time returning became an option, some had built new lives on the mainland.

“My husband would like to move back,” says Philippe’s younger sister, LaDonna Sylve, an artist visiting Grand Bayou from her home in Belle Chasse. “But my grandbabies are right there”—in Belle Chasse—“and they’re a big part of my life. I want to be near them, to nurture them and teach them some of the ways that we had here.”

Feats of Resilience

Since their return to Grand Bayou in 2010, the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe has experimented with adaptations they hope will help them survive climate change, rising waters, and hurricanes.

They’ve turned a barge into a floating home. They’ve built portable gardens in canoes and small boats called pirogues. They’re working with the nonprofit Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana to protect sacred sites with reefs built from oyster shells recycled from New Orleans restaurants. Such reefs not only protect against erosion but also create new oyster habitat.

The tribe has also advocated for a low-tech coastal restoration project: backfilling those canals that were dug by oil and gas companies. In a 2018 study, coastal scientists R. Eugene Turner and Giovanna McClenachan concluded that filling the canals with spoil-bank material “could be a dramatically cost-effective and proven long-term strategy” for reversing land loss.

The scientists estimated that backfilling all the canals would cost about $335 million, less than 1 percent of the state’s $50 billion coastal master plan. “It’s really cheap. You can’t beat it,” says Turner, a professor of oceanography and coastal sciences at Louisiana State University. And yet, “if you go through the master plan and look for the word backfilling, you won’t find it.” (This is true.)

Brown, the CPRA official, agrees that backfilling works. But he also calls Turner’s paper “a little bit hyperbolic” and says that the state’s plan focuses on higher-impact projects.

The tribe is particularly worried about one of those projects: the $1 billion Mid-Barataria Diversion, which would add a series of gates to a Mississippi River levee 15 miles from Grand Bayou. Those gates would allow sediment and freshwater through, nourishing the wetlands and building an estimated 30,000 acres. According to a 2017 study, however, the diversion could increase flooding in Grand Bayou as it enhances wetlands elsewhere. CPRA’s Brown calls flooding a “reasonable concern” and says the state is preparing an analysis.

Beyond specific projects, Grand Bayou residents see a bigger problem with Louisiana’s master plan: When it was last updated, in 2017, they were never officially consulted. “People are making plans for our lives,” says Philippe. “And they’re not letting us self-determine and be a part of that conversation.” While individual members have met with CPRA to discuss specific concerns, all the tribe can do, she says, is speak at public meetings and submit written comments. These are inefficient ways to address existential policy concerns.

The coastal agency did convene a “community focus group” as it developed the 2017 plan, which included representatives from 11 organizations. They included three tribes that the state of Louisiana officially recognizes, though the federal government does not. (Three individual members of the focus group described it as perfunctory. Sandy Ha Nguyen, executive director of Coastal Communities Consulting, a nonprofit serving fishing families and related small businesses, called it a “waste of time.”) The Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha, who lack even state recognition, were not invited.

CPRA’s Brown acknowledges this communication shortfall. “I think that is a fair complaint,” he says. “We did have meetings with several tribes. Grand Bayou is not on that list.” As the state prepares to revise its master plan in 2023, “we are trying to be more intentional about how we reach out—not only to the tribe but to many folks who have not been involved in the process.”

Even open communication has limits, though. Coastal planning involves large state and federal bureaucracies with rigid policy options. Creative solutions like the ones Grand Bayou wants to develop—houses on barges, for example—are typically off the table.

“Nobody’s talked to them about innovative ways to stay,” says Cyn Sarthou, executive director of Healthy Gulf, a New Orleans–based nonprofit. “It’s just ‘You have to fit into our model, or you have to leave.’”

Brown concedes that the state can only consider conventional solutions, because government funding comes with strings. “They are 100 percent correct that programs that fund that work are not going to be nimble,” he says. “That’s a very legitimate criticism.” But he reiterates that no one is forcing the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha to relocate. “We don’t have a forever solution, but we don’t believe it’s unreasonable that Grand Bayou can continue to exist for 30 or 50 years,” he says. (The 25-year flood maps are ambiguous, but Grand Bayou appears to straddle the line between elevation and voluntary acquisition.) Any longer is beyond the state’s planning horizon, Brown notes, and the latter part of the century is likely to bring more land loss, sea level rise, and storm surge.

Coexistence

Grand Bayou’s biggest building is Light Tabernacle Church. Its size mirrors the importance of religious life here. “People still have that desire to put God first in their life,” says Ancar, the pastor. Inside is one of the tribe’s greatest treasures: a set of stained-glass windows depicting life on the bayou. There are images of shrimp boats, a burial site, and wildlife like a crab and an alligator, plus a large, abstract triptych suggesting a sunset over the marsh.

The story behind the stained glass tells a bigger story about place and resilience. The windows were produced by stained-glass artist Mary White, whose father, geographer Gilbert F. White, was the founder of the University of Colorado’s Natural Hazards Center. Until his death in 2006, he believed that behavioral changes, rather than building ever more levees and dams, were the best ways for humans to coexist with flooding.

The Natural Hazards Center convenes an annual workshop. At one of these events, a Grand Bayou resident named Paul Sylve approached the pioneering geographer and serenaded him in Louisiana French as a way of honoring his work. Mary White witnessed this tribute to her father and was moved. After Hurricane Katrina, she offered to craft the windows of the new church under construction. Grand Bayou residents provided drawings and photographs, and three young women from the tribe traveled west to help with the design.

Traditional built-in stained glass made no sense for the village; the next hurricane could level the church. The windows needed a bayou-appropriate adjustment. “What do you do with your treasure if you know that you’re housing it in an impermanent structure?” says Philippe. “You make it movable.” That’s what White created. The smaller images hang in front of the windows but are not permanently attached. The nine-foot-wide triptych is set into a light box over the pulpit and can be detached in sections.

The removable windows, which depict the tribe’s deep roots, embody Grand Bayou’s two competing realities: The tribe intends to stay. And, true to Gilbert White’s message, it recognizes that fragile landscapes require adaptation.

This is nothing new, Philippe says. Since her grandparents’ days, the tribe has adopted new home designs, new clothing, new motorized boats. Philippe knows that other communities are thinking about how to coexist with coastal erosion. “Those designs exist. We just need to find them and incorporate them in the new norm,” she says. “We intend to exhaust every adaptation designed in our quest to stay.”

119,119,"Sep 13, 2018",University of Rochester,Top investment lawyer presents ‘a new mindset’ on women and leadership,"At one point Diane Ambler ’71 started writing a book, a memoir of sorts. Every chapter began with a quotation of something that somebody had said to her.

But there was a hitch. Some of it was outright unprintable, all of it inappropriate, often demeaning. Ambler, who had graduated from Rochester in 1971, was trying to prove herself as a young lawyer in financial and investment law, a male bastion in the early 1980s when she first arrived on the scene.

“It was an outlet for my anger,” she admits. Eventually, she abandoned the book idea. “I guess I became less angry,” Ambler says. “Once I started writing it all down I realized it wasn’t the focus of what I was trying to achieve. In one’s career one has to be strategic how one spends one’s time. And anger is a waste of time.”

Clearly, the Jersey shore native has spent her time well.

Ambler became a pioneer in mutual funds governance. Today, some 40 years later, she tells her stories punctuated by hearty laughter. A highly experienced practitioner in financial institutions regulation and federal securities law, Ambler regularly makes prestigious lists of best lawyers in America and the world’s leading women in business law. In 2001, she moved her established practice to the international firm of K&L Gates, headquartered in Washington, D.C.

She’s the first to admit that she couldn’t have done it alone. That’s one of the reasons she likes being a mentor for young professionals—male and female. She is a member of the executive boards of both the Women in Law Empowerment Forum and the National Association of Women Lawyers.

As a young lawyer, Ambler says, she noticed that most of her male colleagues in securities law were preoccupied with capital formation and deal making. Ambler instead moved into the much less sexy mutual funds law. At that time a nascent field with very few experienced practitioners, it proved fertile ground for Ambler to make her mark.

A new mindset On Monday, September 17, Diane Ambler ’17 will be on campus to speak about “Women as Leaders: A New Mindset” in the Feldman Ballroom in Douglass Commons at 3 p.m. In her talk, part of an Arts, Science & Engineering discussion on topical challenges, Ambler will speak about historical changes and work that remains to be done in the area of women and leadership; how women see themselves as thought leaders; and how institutions are adjusting to these changes. The event is free and open to all students, faculty, and staff, and will be followed by a reception.

“Because of the complexities of these laws and the need to develop an expertise, I had a leg up having started early in this business. So, while the men were out doing deals I was learning the 40 Act [the Investment Company Act of 1940, part of the backbone of US financial regulation]. I became a leader in my field simply because of my tenure.”

At times her rise was lonely. Back then, she says, women were working in “parallel play.” They just didn’t see one another. “We simply didn’t know that there were a lot of women with the same struggles, trying to deal with the same issues.”

Needless to say, her career took hard work and dedication. But sometimes, she says, it simply took a leap of faith, even if opportunities came knocking at inopportune times. For Ambler that pivotal moment arrived in her early 40s. The American Bar Association invited her to chair their Investment Companies and Investment Advisers Subcommittee—a prestigious offer. But Ambler’s first impulse was to turn it down. She had just joined a large, international law firm to develop and lead their new 40 Act practice at a time when the mutual funds industry was beginning to explode. Ambler also was a single mom with a toddler at home.

“I have a lot on my plate. I do not have time for that,” she recalls thinking. “It’s a terrible idea!”

When she mentioned the offer to a male colleague, however, he simply assumed she’d take it. That assumption got her thinking. Are there ways to make it work?

She did. Partially it was the realization that she didn’t need to be one of the firm’s top billers in order to succeed and that many of the 75 percent of partners who fell below the top quartile of billers were highly successful within the firm. And she hired a live-in nanny.

Taking the ABA’s offer turned out to be one of her best professional decisions, she says in hindsight.

“It completely accelerated my career in a way that I never would have anticipated, because it gave me exposure to everyone in the field.” Apart from giving her leadership opportunities in all the critical, developing legal issues, heading up the committee gave her a voice to appear before the regulators. Simply put, “it gave me a platform to develop my career.”

A circuitous route into law

Like many, if not most, advanced professionals, her path was by no means linear. When she graduated from the University of Rochester in 1971, college-educated women, despite their academic credentials, were routinely asked in job interviews how fast they could type. Ambler, who had studied math and physics at Rochester, graduated with a psychology degree. Initially she lacked career focus, she admits.

After landing serendipitously in the real estate business, Ambler noticed that tricky real estate questions often ended up with lawyers. Then, in 1974, the real estate market cratered. Ambler thought long and hard about her next move.

Four years later, with a newly minted JD from Villanova under her belt, she headed to Jackson, Mississippi, where she worked as a law clerk for the Honorable Charles Clark on the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, Louisiana.

“It might just as well have been another country,” she says of her Deep South experience. The judge at one point had been told he should branch out and hire Yankee and female law clerks. Being able to work in the federal courts system proved a valuable experience throughout her career.

Her year in Mississippi and Louisiana is one reason she tells mentees to take chances and plunge right in.

“We fixed the women, now we have to look at the institutions,” she says. That entails helping men understand how to relate to professional women in the era of the #MeToo movement, while simultaneously figuring out ways to prevent women from leaving the workplace, just as their careers begin to take off. At times, Ambler wonders if the movement will be able to keep up its momentum.

She works to make sure it does. More than fifteen years ago, Ambler began building a women’s group at her law firm, which employs some 2,000 lawyers worldwide. Many of the initiatives developed by this group have since been adopted as a firm-wide vision to help their female lawyers succeed.

It's only January, but it's never too soon to start talking about a rivalry game.

In this week's edition of the Clarion Ledger Ole Miss mailbag, we answer questions about the biggest news of the week, which happens to be about what happened in Starkville, not Oxford.

We will make arguments for whether Ole Miss or Mississippi State made the better coaching hire, discuss how Mike Leach and Lane Kiffin will recruit in Mississippi and then touch briefly on basketball.

As always, if you ever have questions you'd like to submit for the mailbag, email them to nsuss@gannett.com or tweet them to our beat writer at @nicksuss.

The big question

Question: Was the Mike Leach hire at Mississippi State better than the Lane Kiffin hire at Ole Miss? --Travis Sigh

Well, Travis, we likely won't get a proper answer to this question for another four or five years. The honest truth is probably that both schools made good hires but neither hire immediately elevates either school to a championship level. But that opinion doesn't make for a compelling column.

So let's outline the arguments for both Kiffin and Leach. At the end, I'll let you — the humble reader — decide which argument is better.

The Kiffin argument

In Kiffin, Ole Miss has hired a coach with a championship pedigree. He has worked as an assistant on three national championship-winning staffs and won two conference championships as the head coach at Florida Atlantic. Two of his mentors include Pete Carroll and Nick Saban, two of the defining college football coaches of this century.

On top of that, Kiffin has a familiarity with the SEC from his three years at Alabama and his one-year stint as head coach at Tennessee. His time as Alabama's offensive coordinator proved his offense can work in the SEC. And his willingness to change that scheme depending on his personnel makes for an easier adjustment when playing with a different regime's recruits.

Finally, Kiffin's brand and confident attitude fits the Ole Miss fanbase and the Oxford personality well.

The Leach argument

In Leach, Mississippi State has hired a coach with a pedigree of production. Leach hasn't coached on a conference championship-winning staff since 1996 at Valdosta State, but he has changed the way offense is played in college and professional football.

In 18 years as a head coach, Leach's offenses have led the FBS in passing yards per game 10 times. Shredding the Big 12 and the Pac-12 is one thing, but Leach's scheme has also produced in the SEC. In 1998, Leach coached Tim Couch to a season with 4,275 passing yards, an SEC record that stood until LSU's Joe Burrow passed it this year.

Leach also has a track record of success and has twice shown he's willing to stay at a school to make it successful.

Beyond this, Leach has uniqueness on his side. Few SEC teams ever have to prepare for the pure, unfiltered Air Raid offense Leach will bring to Mississippi State. Opponents might find it more difficult to prepare for Mississippi State because of this.

And finally, Leach is also a good fit for Starkville. Kiffin's personality fits the culture of Oxford, but Leach's personality is perfect for Starkville. Leach gives off a down-home, blue-collar local boy personality. He appreciates nature and discipline. He likes to walk to work and has already complimented the cleanliness of Mississippi State's campus. Mississippi State fans have fallen in love with him just as much as Ole Miss fans have fallen in love with Kiffin.

The recruiting angle

Question: Can Leach recruit from Starkville? He eventually did at Texas Tech. Lane will recruit well at Ole Miss. -- @rpmjrOM on Twitter

Neither Leach nor Kiffin has directly emphasized in-state recruiting in their short tenures.

After the early signing period, Kiffin said he wanted to recruit like a national program. That means getting the players he and his staff identify as the best available, regardless of regional affiliation. Only if players from Mississippi are the best available or as good as players from other states will Kiffin and his staff consider them.

Leach, meanwhile, spoke at his introductory press conference about being a regional recruiter. He described the 350-mile radius from Starkville as the most fertile recruiting grounds in the country. And sure, that includes every inch of Mississippi. But it also includes Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville, Birmingham, Memphis and Pensacola, Florida.

Since Leach has never coached in this region before, it's hard to say how his recruiting style will translate. That said, Washington State ranked in the bottom five in the Pac-12 in recruiting in all eight of his seasons in Pullman, according to the 247Sports composite rankings. He still went to six bowl games. So the success of Leach's teams may not be particularly dependent on recruiting.

It'd honestly be a surprise if Leach out-recruited Kiffin. Kiffin's FAU classes ranked first, third and first in the Conference USA by the 247Sports composite rankings, and he built his staff to include nationally regarded recruiters like Chris Partridge and D.J. Durkin.

But how much will recruiting matter if Mississippi State has the schematic advantage under Leach?

More: Mike Leach, Lane Kiffin bring new flavor to Ole Miss, Mississippi State rivalry

A basketball thought

Question: This basketball team clearly has multiple issues, but how much is it missing Luis Rodriguez? -- @Ehutto on Twitter

There's definitely some of that. Luis Rodriguez was supposed to be the glue guy for Ole Miss basketball this year, passing and rebounding from the three-guard spot much in the same way Terence Davis did last season.

Without him, Ole Miss hasn't found a consistent middle guy for the lineup. Putting K.J. Buffen and Blake Hinson on the floor together has created defensive issues. Franco Miller, Austin Crowley and Dude Collum don't look ready yet. Bryce Williams has battled injuries.

More: Lane Kiffin's coaching staff at Ole Miss built from some of 2015's best teams

Rodriguez solves some of these issues by putting a role player in a role player's position. But that might not solve Ole Miss' offensive issues, which are the bigger problems now. Unless Rodriguez would've been scoring 12 points a game, bringing him back right now wouldn't fix everything wrong with this Ole Miss team.

Business 2021's Best Cities for Outdoor Jobs If you love the outdoors LawnStarter released its 2021 Best Cities for Outdoor Jobs report Reply

Among the best cities for outdoor jobs ranking 34th is Grand Rapids Michigan (Image Credit (GlacierNPS/flickr))

Would you rather be working outside in nature than indoors punching a time clock? Forest rangers, landscapers, and so many others who work outdoors prefer to do their jobs amid the fresh air, sunshine, and wide open spaces.

Outdoor jobs also have their challenges -- delivering the mail in the cold or installing a roof in the heat. But not every city is fertile ground for outdoor careers like gardening, pool cleaning, and ski instructing.

That's why LawnStarter took stock of the outdoor employment landscape, to bring you its 2021 Best Cities for Outdoor Jobs report. They compared the 200 largest employment markets in the U.S. across 26 key factors — from outdoor job opportunities to cost of living to average daily temperature.

Check out the winners (and losers), followed by some highlights and lowlights from their report. Highlights and Lowlights:

Out and About in the Southwest: Arizona dominated our ranking, with four cities in the top 10. While not topping the charts in any single category, Scottsdale, Tempe and other Copper State cities earned high marks in opportunity metrics, such as labor force participation, and in safety metrics, such as health insurance coverage.

While not topping the charts in any single category, Scottsdale, Tempe and other Copper State cities earned high marks in opportunity metrics, such as labor force participation, and in safety metrics, such as health insurance coverage. Wet in the Washington Wilds: Washington is another surprising winner with three cities in our top 10. The Evergreen State is known for being wet, but with a high transit score, a high minimum wage, and no state income tax, its cities are a pretty good place to settle in for your new outdoor career. For example, Seattle — at No. 3 — didn't do well on that rainy metric, but it outperformed in opportunity and affordability metrics.

California — Almost: Many California cities did well in the outdoor job opportunities metric, with six entries in the top 10. Despite this, these locales finished mid-range overall. Here's why: Cities with a multitude of outdoor opportunities like Fullerton performed poorly on other measures such as natural hazards, air quality, and of course, cost of living.

Sweating in the South: Southern cities fared the worst in our outdoor employment ranking with eight of the bottom 10 in Alabama and Mississippi. It's not difficult to see why: Cities such as Jackson have a low minimum wage, too many extremely hot days, and well above-average amounts of precipitation. Key takeaway: While we all would love a little more time outdoors, most of us would rather not spend it in a muggy swamp.

122,122,"Oct 27, 2020",SouthBMore.com,GoFundMe Launched to Help Save The 8×10 in Federal Hill,"The owners of The 8×10 live music venue in Federal Hill have launched a GoFundMe to raise money to keep this longtime Federal Hill business afloat. The 8×10 has been open in Federal Hill since 1983, but it has been closed since March 13th due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The GoFundMe aims to raise $100,000 and has already raised almost $40,000 just a day after it was launched. From the GoFundMe:

Unfortunately, it has come to this. The 8×10 needs your help.

For those that don’t know about The 8×10, we are a live music venue in Baltimore, Md. Under various owners, the location in Federal Hill neighborhood has been providing a home for live music since 1983. My wife Abigail Janssens and myself, Brian Shupe have owned and operated it since 2005.

The 8×10 is legendary for its intimacy, its pristine sound, and most of all, its rabid and fiercely loyal fanbase. We get told all the time by bands that we are their favorite venue east of the Mississippi. We have poured our souls into the venue to live up to those standards and provide a fertile ground for bands and audiences to connect seamlessly.

The 8×10 shut its doors on March 13th 2020 and has been dark ever since. Being an entertainment venue, we are going to be the last industry to recover. While bars and restaurants have been open for several months, we just have been permitted to open at 25% capacity.

The problem breaks down into two main issues. Safety and Revenue.

SAFETY ISSUES

The last thing we are going to do is create a situation where our family of customers, bands, and employees get sick. We have been going back and forth about when would it be safe to open, when the outbreak at The White House happened, that put everything into perspective. How fast it spread, How many people were infected from one little gathering. And that was outdoors. The 8×10 is a small venue. There is hardly any way to socially distance. Even with lower capacity, masks, temperature checks, if someone unknowingly came to a show, The 8×10 would be a super spreader. We couldn’t live with that.

REVENUE ISSUES

Right now we can open at 25% capacity. Do I want to put my staff at risk of bringing home COVID-19 to their children or elderly parents for 25% of their usual tips? Our doorman is going to have to interact with every single patron multiple times a night, what kind of risk is that? But that isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. Where are we going to get bands? Bands aren’t touring yet out of fear and simply not being able to find enough venues that are allowed to open. Is a band that usually plays to 300 people and makes a couple thousand dollars going to be able to cover the exact same expenses from 25% of their normal ticket sales? And are you the public going to risk coming to shows? What should we do? Should we start charging four times as much for the tickets to make up the difference? We just can’t stomach charging $60 to our faithful patrons for the same show they normally pay $15 to attend. There are no easy answers.

COST OF DOING BUSINESS

Meanwhile, we are still paying our expenses to the tune of $15,000 a month. Our rent alone is $10k a month. Every month. Our landlord has been very generous to offer us some relief and has promised us he will do everything he can to ensure The 8×10 survives this, but he is struggling too. The 8×10 is all about doing the right thing, and we can’t run out on our commitment to him or any of our other vendors and monthly responsibilities. Rent, Gas & Electric, Insurance, Telephone, Internet, yada yada yada.

We were lucky. We got an emergency relief loan through the government and we have been able to meet our responsibilities up to now. And we can still make it but probably only to the end of the year. But this is a loan, not a grant. It is not a forgivable package, but a loan. That means after working so hard and struggling to serve the community for 15 years, once we had finally pulled our head above water, COVID-19 struck and derailed our retirement plans and now were are once again in debt. The $150,000 dollars that has been keeping The 8×10 from bankruptcy is going to have to be repaid and it is going to come out of Abigail’s and my pocket. It’s the cost of doing business and we know it. But the government is not helping our industry. Live music venues, movie theaters, theaters for plays and musicals are all suffering the most and going to be the last industry to recover. Since there is no second round of loans or aid on the horizon, it has come to this. We have to turn to the people that come to, and play at The 8×10 for help.

We hate the fact that we are asking for charity, but if comes down to begging or letting The 8×10 disappear due to some pandemic…We have no pride. We will do whatever it takes to keep The 8×10 alive for our community of music lovers. There is no shame in that. If there was another way, believe me we would be doing it.

OUR GOAL

Honestly, we know 2020 has been a screw job on everybody and finances are tough for everyone. We are just hoping that Many Hands Make Light Work. There have been hundreds of thousands of people that have come through the doors of The 8×10. If we can spread the financial burden of keeping The 8×10 solvent over all the people who have come and had their minds blown by the magic coming off the stage, celebrated with their friends a marriage, birth, promotion, birthday, or just that it is a Friday night. If we can spread it out over the thousands of bands that have played there over the years and told us how much they love The 8×10. If everyone who has ever been touched by what The 8×10 does can just donate what they can afford then the burden won’t seem so heavy.

Our bare minimum goal would be to put six more months of expenses into savings. Maybe just maybe by then we will have a vaccine or some semblance of our normal lives back. But in March we were sure it would be over by June. In August we were saying it has to be better by October, yet nothing has changed.

Whatever we can raise we will be grateful for. I can tell you that every cent of the money will go to expenses at The 8×10 first and foremost. If by some miracle we are able to open soon, 100% of the remainder of the money will go to paying back the $150k loan.

We need your help. We need you to spread this website to every person you know. Do you have a contact with any of the big bands that played The 8×10 back when they were coming up? Send them a link, ask them to give back if they can. Do you have a contact with a music magazine or online community? Represent for us and tell them what we stand for and ask if they can throw us a few.

Please, please know that we are only asking for you to give an amount that makes sense for your situation. Every donation will add up, so please don’t try and be a hero and end up putting strain on your situation.

123,123,"Nov 14, 2020",NOLA.com,James Gill: Are Democrats Satan-worshipping pedophiles? Many Louisianans think so.,"Polls are widely, and justifiably, pooh-poohed these days, but we can probably trust one that finds Louisiana is fertile ground for QAnon conspiracy theories.

The three states with the highest concentration of QAnon adherents, at 12 – 14 percent, are Louisiana, Georgia and Mississippi. Nationwide, one in 10 Americans favor Qanon, a poll by a group called HOPE not Hate found.

That means there are many millions of people walking the streets of this country who believe that Satan-worshipping pedophile Democrats secretly rule the world, injecting themselves with adrenochrome, an elixir extracted from the children they abduct. Wayfair had been forced to issue statements denying that traffickers conceal children in the cabinets it manufactures.

Georgia has just gone one better than Louisiana by electing dedicated QAnonist Marjorie Taylor Greene to Congress. Another congresswoman-elect, gun-toting Lauren Boebert of Colorado, has somewhat backed off her earlier endorsement of QAnon.

With Clay Higgins about to begin his third term in Congress, Louisiana is no slouch when it comes to political paranoia, however. Higgins has voiced support for two gangs of deluded right-wingers — the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers.

Boebert won election after denouncing the incumbent in the primary as insufficiently devoted to President Donald Trump. Greene, meanwhile, believes Trump is uniquely qualified to rid the world of the cabal that runs our lives from the shadows. The QAnon faithful believe that, when Trump delivers mankind from bondage, cabal members will be shipped off to Guantanamo Bay and hanged.

Greene, whose many racist slurs include denouncing the Jewish financier and philanthropist George Soros as a Nazi bent on world domination, may be a repugnant spokeswoman for a deranged movement, but she is Trump's cup of tea. He has called her a “future Republican star,” and lauded QAnon as “people that love our country.” The FBI takes a different view, having dubbed QAnon a “domestic terrorist threat.”

President-elect Joe Biden is naturally at a odds with Trump over QAnon, having whimsically suggested last week that its adherents have a screw loose. He said they should take advantage of the mental health benefits provided by the Affordable Care Act, which Trump was hoping the U.S. Supreme Court would throw out.

Some fans must wonder why Trump doesn't just make it happen, for QAnon has taken on the trappings of a religion and he is widely credited with divine powers. When Trump was sick with the coronavirus, Brendan Dilley, a radio talk show host who doubles as a “Make-America-Great-Again life coach,” predicted he would soon recover on account of his “god-tier genetics.” From whom gods inherit their genes must remain imponderable.

It would be folly to write off QAnon believers as no-account suckers, however. There are so many of them that they must run the IQ gamut. What they believe may seem incompatible with sweet reason and scientific principle, but the same applies to the tenets of any faith. A Pew survey found that 80% of Americans believe in miracles, so whatever objections may be raised to QAnon, its adherents cannot be accused of unusual credulity.

Their emergence is alarming because their high priests do not preach peace and reconciliation. QAnon believers take their cues from a mysterious online source, purportedly a high-ranking government official with all the inside dope on the domestic threats to the American way of life. QAnon's version of Armageddon is the Storm, when Trump will vanquish the evildoers and — you've guessed it — make America great again.

Until that wonderful day arrives, militias inspired by QAnon and similar paranoid movements are evidently prepared to stage violent resistance to the government they believe is oppressing them. Six militiamen right now await trial on charges of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Trump's “Liberate Michigan” tweets in response to Whitmer's coronavirus lockdown order was a clear incitement to thuggery, and very much in character. He is too busy fabricating tales of election fraud to contradict goofy conspiracy theories.

125,125,"Jul 15, 2020",Yahoo News,"Mississippi Is Replacing Its State Flag, But a Confederate Emblem Still Flies Over Georgia","In late June, as many people across the United States took a renewed look at the nation’s history of racism, legislators in Mississippi voted yea on House Bill 1796, replacing the state flag. With that, theirs became the last state to remove a flying Confederate battle emblem from above their statehouse. The landslide vote, with 92 of 115 Representatives and 37 of 51 Senators opting for removal, was resoundingly heralded as a massive step forward for American equality.

However, even though the well-known design of a blue X with white stars criss-crossing a field of deep red, which featured heavily on Mississippi’s now-former state flag, often gets referred to as “the Confederate flag,” it wasn’t—and even though many people thought this was the last lingering official state symbol of the Confederacy, it isn’t.

The actual Confederate flag is almost identical to the current state flag of Georgia, and that’s not a coincidence. It was a deliberate choice, a way of forcing an emblem of the Confederacy onto the public by stealthily using a design that fewer people recognize, and it worked. A recent New York Times article on the removal of the Mississippi flag, when referencing other state flags with designs some consider to be “obliquely referencing Confederate iconography” did not call out the symbol in use by Georgia. The official Confederate flag, hiding in plain sight, still flies over an American capitol building.

Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter

When the Southern states decided to secede in 1861, their Provisional Congress established a Committee on the Flag and Seal to decide on a new flag design. The Committee leader, William Porcher Miles, was inundated with letters from citizens and leaders expressing attachment to the Stars and Stripes of the United States. They were loath to give up their favorite symbol of freedom, which was ironic given their primary goal was preservation of slavery. As a compromise, the Confederate flag-makers settled on an imitation design they called the Stars and Bars: three horizontal stripes, two red and one white, with a blue corner in the upper left containing a circle of 13 brilliant stars.

Story continues

But in their efforts to make the flag similar to the American banner, the designers inadvertently did too good of a job. During the first major battle of the war, the First Battle of Bull Run, commanding officers couldn’t tell which flag was which when they hung limply on their poles. At least one Confederate regiment fired on another, and multiple officers left written records of the confusion.

Thus, the Confederate battle flag was born. Even hanging on a pole, the new banner was easy to distinguish from the Stars and Stripes, and flag-related conundrums faded from combat. The battle flag too largely disappeared in the decades after the end of the Civil War—but, like clockwork, each time Black Americans began to agitate for less systemic oppression, it popped back up again, a not-so-subtle symbol of rebellion against the fight for equality. In 1894, during the ramp-up to the formal Supreme Court legalization of segregation in 1896, Mississippi incorporated it into their state flag. When the Supreme Court ended school segregation with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Georgia replied with a bill adding a large battle flag emblem to their state’s banner.

Now, in the face of new protests for racial equality, one at a time the Confederate symbols have come back down. However, some stealthy racists of the past have ensured that, so far, at least one symbol has remained overlooked by the national conversation.

Georgia shrank the battle flag emblem from its dominant position on its state flag in 2001 in a move led by the Georgia House Black Caucus and supported by Democratic then-Governor Roy Barnes. However, direct backlash from conservative white voters helped lead to Barnes’ ouster from office. In 2003 the new leadership swiftly replaced the 2001 flag with a second, more clandestine, but nonetheless gigantic emblem of the Confederacy, a so-called “compromise flag.” The compromise flag, which is still Georgia’s current state flag, is literally the Stars and Bars Confederate flag, but with a small yellow insignia added in the center of the circle. At the time, members of the Georgia Black caucus supported the move as being some version of progress, although admittedly imperfect, stating that at least this symbol of the Confederacy had not been used as commonly to intimidate and terrify Black Americans during the Civil Rights era.

Now we have made even more progress, and the current reckoning should not overlook the “compromise” for which activists had to settle in the past. The Confederate government existed solely to keep Black Americans in unwilling bondage, and its primary symbol still flies over every resident of the state of Georgia. If Americans want to remove what is truly the last Confederate flag, Georgia will have to follow in the footsteps of Mississippi.

126,126,"Jan 7, 2021",The Detroit News,"After years of work, Abrams takes victory lap in Georgia","Atlanta – Stacey Abrams spent years crisscrossing Georgia, working to convince Democratic leaders, donors and prospective candidates that a vast, untapped well of potential voters could upend Republican domination in the state. There was no national media spotlight or constant praise from national political players to ease the slog.

That’s over now.

After disappointments including her own narrow defeat for governor in 2018, Abrams is being credited with laying the organizational groundwork that helped Democrats capture the state’s two Senate seats. Those victories this week propelled the party into the Senate majority and follow Joe Biden’s win in November, the first time a Democratic presidential candidate has taken the state since 1992.

The turnabout leaves Abrams as perhaps the nation’s most popular, influential Democrat not in elected office. It gives the 47-year-old voting rights advocate considerable momentum for whatever comes next – most likely a rematch with Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022.

“I think what’s next for Stacey is whatever Stacey wants to be next,” said Leah Daughtry, a former chief of staff at the Democratic National Committee. “She’s clearly demonstrated her political prowess, her ability to plan – Georgia didn’t happen overnight.”

Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Noam Lee previewed the potential matchup in a brief statement: “Gov. Kemp, you’re next. See you in 2022.”

Former President Barack Obama called Georgia “a testament to the tireless and often unheralded work of grassroots organizing” and credited Abrams with “resilient, visionary leadership.”

The praise came fast and furious, especially from her fellow Black women who, collectively, saw their stock rise in Democratic politics in 2020 after spending decades as an underappreciated anchor of the party. “Stacey Abrams (that’s the tweet),” wrote Karine Jean-Pierre, incoming deputy White House press secretary.

“She’s earned her spot as a party elder and a party wise-woman,” said Karen Finney, one of Abrams’ advisers in her 2018 campaign.

Former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean called her the “LeBron James of American politics.”

“She has just an enormous amount of talent, and the ability to focus that talent in a very intense way,” Dean said. “And so when you get somebody like that, of course you want them elevated as much as possible.”

On Monday, Abrams had stood at Democrats’ election-eve rally where Biden gushed that “nobody in America has done more” for voting rights and the party.

“Stacey, you’re changing Georgia,” Biden said. “You’ve changed America.”

Abrams, a Mississippi native with degrees from historically Black Spelman College and Yale Law School, attempted to deflect.

“Let’s celebrate the extraordinary organizers, volunteers, canvassers and tireless groups that haven’t stopped going since November,” Abrams tweeted as the Rev. Raphael Warnock’s victory became apparent. “Across our state, we roared. A few miles to go … but well done!”

But Georgia’s shift in 2020 is a reflection of her willingness to see a new coalition in Democratic politics – and to fight even her party’s old guard in the process.

“This is a lot of work, but people need to believe in building multiracial, multigenerational, geographically diverse coalitions – and that means believe in Black people in the South,” said Lauren Groh-Wargo, who managed Abrams’ 2018 campaign for governor and now leads her Fair Fight Action political organization.

“For years, that just wasn’t a thing,” Groh-Wargo continued. “People told us year after year, no, Black people don’t vote in the South and white people are too hard.”

Essentially, Abrams was telling the mostly white, older power brokers in Georgia Democratic politics that they were on a fool’s errand trying to convince older white voters to return to the party after decades of a Southern shift toward Republicans. The path to closing the gap with Republicans, she insisted, was drawing new voters to the polls. In her vision, that would include everyone from transplants to metro Atlanta to older Black voters who just didn’t vote and younger white Georgia natives who simply aren’t as conservative as their parents and grandparents.

It almost worked in 2018.

Abrams won the Democratic nomination over a fellow state legislator recruited by the party’s white power brokers who weren’t convinced a Black woman could win in Georgia. In the general election, she finished less than 20,000 votes shy of forcing a runoff against Kemp, a small fraction of the usual Democratic shortfall of 200,000-plus votes. She turned her loss, and her insistence that Kemp had used his post as secretary of state to make it harder for Georgians to vote, to double down.

Transitioning her campaign into Fair Fight, the group continued registering tens of thousands of Georgians. The close loss drew in plenty of money, including a seven-figure investment from billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Other groups followed, seeing Georgia as fertile ground for Democratic organizing.

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer more or less openly begged Abrams to run for the Senate in 2020 – at the same time some supporters urged her to run for the presidency. She demurred, continuing her work in Georgia and expanding Fair Fight into 19 other battleground states. According to Democrats with knowledge of their conversations, it was Abrams who helped persuade Warnock to run.

At the same time, Abrams never stopped pushing Democrats to support her Georgia efforts and copy them nationally.

“Any decision less than full investment in Georgia would amount to strategic malpractice,” Abrams and Groh-Wargo wrote in a 2019 memo sent to presidential candidates, Democratic National Committee leaders and top party strategists and pollsters. They wrote that Abrams’ 2018 coalition of nonwhites and whites from the cities and suburbs was a blueprint “to compete in the changing landscape of the Sun Belt.”

It was a national replay of the same tussle she’d had years before with Georgia power players, as she argued for an expanded electorate rather than chasing former Democrats and GOP-leaning independents.

Groh-Wargo emphasized this week that one difference between 2018 and 2020 was the success at turning out Black voters in rural areas. “This is the model for states like Mississippi and Alabama … even Ohio,” she said.

Abrams was among the 11 women whom Biden interviewed to be his running mate, a process that led to Kamala Harris becoming the first Black woman nominated and elected to that office. As Biden considered his options, Abrams again managed to rewrite some of the rules.

While some contenders, including Harris, sidestepped questions about being in the mix, Abrams was unapologetic about the possibility.

“The issue of being able to serve as lieutenant and possibly to step in is a question of competence, (and) I would put my resume against anyone else’s,” she told The Associated Press in May.

Days later, she explained her self-assurance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“As a young Black girl growing up in Mississippi,” Abrams said. “I learned that if I didn’t speak up for myself, no one else would.”

(Alexandra Marvar/Chicago Tribune/TNS)

GREENVILLE, Miss. — Along the mighty Mississippi lies a 200-mile diamond-shaped swath of fertile farmland and floodplain known as the Mississippi Delta. It's a region rich with blues music, civil rights sites and agribusiness (especially cotton). It's also the spiritual home of a beloved snack called the hot tamale.

Similar to the Mexican version but pocket-sized, the Delta hot tamale is spiced cornmeal and meat, often pork, rolled up in cornhusk or parchment paper — portable, delicious and rich in history.

When Memphis, Tenn., native and Chicago restaurateur Eldridge Williams opened his Wicker Park bar and eatery, The Delta, in 2017, he wanted a theme evocative of his Southern roots, but something different and unexpected, too. Today, the menu is an homage to the Mississippi Delta hot tamales he grew up with.

""Who doesn't like tamales?"" Williams asked. ""But no one really knows the significance tamales have in African American history and Southern culture. What I love most about hot tamales is the history.""

There are several theories about how tamales came to the Delta. But the most accepted one goes back to the early 20th century, when plantation owners brought migrant workers from Latin America to work in the cotton fields, joining a largely African American workforce of laborers and share croppers.

""Mexican workers would travel with tamales in coffee cans,"" Williams said. ""Other families working in the same cotton fields were introduced to tamales and started to develop their own recipes, passing that tradition down generation to generation.""

Recipes are closely guarded, and good tamales are a point of family pride.

""Most of the people we met who are great at what they do in the tamale game, they're old and they've been doing this for decades after their parents and their grandparents,"" Williams said.

""Of course they're not going to tell us their recipes, so we just ate our way through the Delta until we figured out what we were going to do.

""The Mississippi Delta is a hidden gem,"" Williams added. ""You get more than just good eating. You get amazing stories to go along with it.""

Just down the street from the famed Crossroads, where bluesman Robert Johnson is said to have sold his soul to the devil (before penning his 1930s ode to the hot tamale), you can find Hicks' World Famous, 305 S. State St. Williams calls it ""arguably the best tamale joint in the Mississippi Delta.""

At the Crossroads proper, Abe's Bar-B-Q, 616 N. State St., no longer makes tamales in house. But it still serves the recipe the original Lebanese proprietor derived after falling in love with tamales from a local street cart in the '40s.

Round out the night with live blues at Red's, 395 Sunflower Ave., or at Delta native and actor Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero Blues Club, 387 Delta Ave., where the tamales are served fried instead of boiled. And then call it a night at the Shack Up Inn, 001 Commissary Circle Road, a good-vibes-only makeshift village of reclaimed cotton shacks decorated with thrift store finds.

Halfway between Clarksdale and Greenville is Cleveland, which debuted its $18 million Grammy Museum in 2016. Less polished sites such as Dockery Farms, 229 Highway 8, an old cotton plantation that claims to be the birthplace of the blues, are just as sacred, if not more so, to music pilgrims, history buffs and locals.

You'll find tamales at the rustic billiards-and-blues bar Airport Grocery, 3608 Highway 61. And if you swing by James Beard Award semifinalist Cole Ellis' Delta Meat Market for breakfast, lunch or bustling Friday happy hour, you can find them vacuum-packed to take home. The grocery store and restaurant are conveniently located in the Cotton House hotel, 215 Cotton Row.

Whether at Scott's Hot Tamales, 304 Highway 1, Hot Tamale Heaven, 1427 Highway 1, or a number of other spots around town, tamales are easy to find in this city of 30,000. In fact, it's the self-proclaimed Hot Tamale Capital of the World.

In an old, wooden house on the former blues thoroughfare of Nelson Street, seek out Doe's Eat Place, 502 Nelson St., winner of myriad culinary accolades and often called one of the country's best steakhouses. The James Beard Foundation named it one of America's Classics. Despite these titles, it's unassuming and unpretentious. The scent of grill smoke hangs in the air, and the odd retired steak knife might be found leveling uneven furniture. Tamales, steak and salad on the side make the quintessential Doe's meal. ""And let's just say it has tons of character,"" Williams said.

Plan ahead for the Delta Hot Tamale Festival the third weekend of October, when dozens of hot tamale makers come from hundreds of miles around to compete in a variety of categories. Other highlights include a hot tamale-eating contest.

On the town's main drag, the new Lofts at 517, at 517 Washington Ave., are a posh spot to spend the night.

In this town an hour southeast of Clarksdale, Giardina's, 314 Howard St., has been hosting Deltans for fine dining since the mid-1930s. In addition to the beloved steaks and fresh fish, try the baked oysters, homemade Italian sausage and, of course, hot tamales.

At The Crystal Grill, 423 Carrollton Ave., tamales are a great opener to fried quail, chicken livers and meringue pies. And Steven's Bar-B-Q, 208 Fulton St., is a classic meat-and-three (pick your meat and two traditional Southern sides) with hot tamales on the menu and, weekly, hot tamale pie.

Overnighters, check out the Delta's only upscale independent boutique hotel, The Alluvian, 318 Howard St.

If you head back north to Clarksdale from here, you'll pass through Money, Glendora, Sumner and Tutwiler, towns full of blues and civil rights sites. More tamale-tasting opportunities can be had by following the Southern Foodways Alliance's map to eateries in Rosedale, Yazoo City and Vicksburg.","— Along the mighty Mississippi lies a 200-mile diamond-shaped swath of fertile farmland and floodplain known as the Mississippi Delta.
Today, the menu is an homage to the Mississippi Delta hot tamales he grew up with.

Carola Penn, a leading Pacific Northwest artist whose paintings were rooted in landscapes both political and personal, has died. She was 74.

Penn, who was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, spent most of her life in Portland, where she lived quietly, dedicating her days to her work. She was laconic by nature; prolific and disciplined.

Educated in the 1960s at the University of California at Berkeley, Penn studied under the leading midcentury California artist Elmer Bischoff. She was influenced by German Expressionism, Paul Klee and Van Gogh, but also absorbed much of the work happening around her at the time, most notably Bay Area artists David Park, Richard Diebenkorn and Joan Brown.

Penn’s activist bent took root during the Civil Rights Movement, when she was arrested for participating in a sit-in in Washington D.C. to unseat the Mississippi delegation during the 1964 Democratic National Convention. At the height of the Vietnam War, she and her husband, Dennis Anderson, decided to move to Canada. En route, they stopped in Portland, where they took up residence and never left.

Penn worked tirelessly, creating multiple series of paintings with subjects ranging from Lair Hill neighborhoods to inner-city Portland; from patches of grasses and weeds to Washington State’s Yale Valley forest; from politics to the inner landscapes of childhood. Painting on panels of wood, she experimented with cutting and rearranging the pieces. The resulting juxtapositions were occasionally jarring, often unexpected and always provocative.

Her last show, Disruptions, was curated by Dr. Sheldon Hurst and exhibited in 2018 at ArtReach Gallery in Portland. The exhibition, a culmination of her life’s work, would be her last. Soon after, she had to use a wheelchair and was unable to continue working in her studio.

Critic Carol Mazer wrote in 2018 of Disruptions: “Penn’s connection to place—Portland and its environs, where she has lived for some fifty years—is palpable. She is respectful, perhaps awed by the power of the forest and paints natural beauty lovingly. The brush strokes and colors she employs to paint its destruction evoke deep sadness … this show presents a very critical eye on what we have lost/gained in environmental terms, in human bonds, in the cohesion of communities. But, as Penn states in her brief notes, ‘I want to bring disparate elements together in order to stimulate thinking about mending problems and finding answers through on-going dialog.’ … Sheldon Hurst, curator of this show, chose a few quotes by writers whose concerns are germane to what you’ll see here, notably John Berger. ‘Hope,’ he wrote, ‘is not a form of guarantee; it’s a form of energy, and very frequently that energy is strongest in circumstances that are very dark.’ And in that sense these paintings most certainly are conceived and propelled by hope.”

Art Critic Randy Gragg wrote in 1994: Penn’s “thick, energetic brushwork builds to a climax of heavy grays and browns. She slices up her paintings, as she puts it, using the ‘jigsaw as a cubist weapon.’ The way she presents the finished pieces—spread across the wall and sometimes the floor—is a belligerent defiance of painting as ambient decoration . . . As so many other landscape painters keep the lawns orderly . . . [Penn] is digging at the uneasy beauty of the weeds.”

Art Critic Lois Allan wrote in 1995: “For Carola Penn, urban life yields images that are like mental snapshots . . . rundown storefronts, bridge girders, parking lots, even manholes in the pavement. All unremarkable fragments within the city’s kaleidoscopic movement, they form an ongoing, open-ended narrative . . . [Compartments] freezes these fragments in thickly layered, low-key colors and stark images—visceral responses to emotional as well as architectural divisions, and to the gritty streets and their inhabitants.”

On April 2, after a 3-year struggle with cancer, Penn died peacefully at home surrounded by her loving family. She was pre-deceased by her husband, Dennis Anderson, who died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Zoë Anderson; son, Lev Anderson; three grandchildren, Emma, Daniel and Dennis; three siblings, Roxie, Roy and Sue; and her 100-year-old mother, Miriam Silverman.

The family is hoping to have a memorial at Penn’s studio in the North Coast Seed Building this summer.

134,134,1 month ago,LSU Wire,Best LSU football recruit from every state since the year 2000,"LSU is fortunate to be in a hotbed of football recruiting in the state of Louisiana. LSU has traditionally been able to keep much of the state’s top talent close to home, but sometimes the Tigers have to go on the prowl beyond the state’s borders if they want to build the best recruiting class possible.

With another recruiting cycle in the books, now is a good time to take a look at the LSU recruiting efforts since the turn of the century and see who the best LSU recruit in each state has been.

To put together this list, the 247 Sports composite rankings are referenced. In all, 20 states are included in LSU’s recruiting efforts since 2000. The most fertile grounds for LSU recruiting are close to home in Louisiana and Texas. Those two states have produced players like Derek Stingley, Grant Delpit, Jarvis Landry, and Joseph Addai, just to name a few. LSU has also claimed some recruiting victories in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi and brought a recruit home from California, Michigan, and Ohio.

For the purposes of this list, JUCO players are included, and they are specifically noted. Keep in mind JUCO recruiting rankings are not necessarily the same as the traditional recruiting class rankings.

135,135,"Mar 25, 2018",TechCrunch,Here are the top Midwestern states and cities for startups – TechCrunch,"The American Midwest has a long history of making stuff. During the 20th century, it was the manufacturing center for the nation, and indeed much of the world. It’s still where a surpassing majority of agricultural commodities are grown and processed. But is it also a major producer of technology startups? Maybe not as much as the coasts, but the Midwest’s bustling metropoli and vast expanses of rural land prove to be fertile ground for quite a bit of startup activity.

And that’s what we’re going to take a look at here. In a similar vein to our recent analysis of startup fundraising in the South, we’ll break down the region into its constituent parts, assessing deal and dollar volume trends in the Midwest’s two primary sub-regions, some of its individual states and the most active metropolitan areas in the U.S.’s midsection.

And, to be clear, this is not Crunchbase News’s first foray into the region. We’ve covered the region’s seed-stage interest in AI and hard tech, a few notable rounds and have always included the Midwest in all manner of data-spelunking expeditions. And to this, we’ll add a deep dive into the numbers.

Defining the midwest

Borders and boundaries are a deep well of disputes. To preempt debate, we use the U.S. Census Bureau’s definition of the Midwest region which, unlike its definition of the South, shouldn’t be too controversial. If you have something against Kansas or Ohio being included in this group, take it up with the Feds.

The good folks at the Census Bureau split the Midwest into two distinct — and rather unimaginatively named — sub-regions: the West North Central and East North Central states, which are separated by the Mississippi River. We’ve included the map below.

By splitting the Midwest into two distinct parts, we’ll be able to see where most of the startup and funding activity is concentrated. Spoiler alert: The farther west you go, the startup population (and the population itself) grows more scattered.

Capital flows into Midwestern startups

Based only on reported data in Crunchbase, the Midwest appears to be affected by the same phenomenon as the rest of the country. Crunchbase News has previously found that the number of seed and early-stage deals has gone off a cliff in the U.S., resulting in a top-heavy market featuring many large, late-stage deals. And this wouldn’t be a problem if it weren’t for a shortfall in new startups to fill the next cycle of early-stage funding. The “hollowing out” of the Midwestern venture deal pipeline becomes readily apparent when you look at funding data for the past several years, which you can find in the chart below.

To wit, deal volume is down markedly since 2014, as Crunchbase News reported in its Q4 2017 report of startup funding activity in the U.S. and Canada. But somewhat counterintuitively, the amount of money being invested into startups is on the rise in the Midwest and throughout many other parts of the country, reaching fresh multi-year highs in 2017. Almost one full quarter into 2018, the trend appears to continue unabated.

But this chart abstracts away a lot of nuance, so let’s take a closer look at the region and its states.

Focusing in on Midwestern deal and dollar volume

We’ll start first with deal volume, because that’s a fairly decent indicator of a geographic region’s level of startup activity. Below, we’ve plotted venture deal volume, divided by sub-region.

Again, based on the reported data from Crunchbase, we found that deal counts have been on a downward trend for several years. And though some of this may be attributable to reporting delays, projected deal volume data for the whole of the U.S. and Canada (fourth chart down in the Q4 quarterly report) shows a years’-long downtrend. There’s no reason to believe that startup activity in the Midwest is materially different from the rest of the U.S. and Canada.

But what about the relative “balance of power” between the two sub-regions? At least when it comes to deal volume, has one sub-region waxed while the other waned? To a limited extent, the answer is yes. Between 2012 and 2017, the percentage share of all Midwestern dealflow going to West North Central states like the Dakotas, Minnesota and Missouri has grown from 25.4 percent to 31.2 percent, up by nearly one-fifth in relative terms.

Now let’s check out dollar volume. The chart below displays aggregate reported venture capital dollar volume raised by startups in the Midwest.

As far as the amount of money Midwestern startups have raised over time, the trendline is generally up and to the right. But that’s not the only way this differs from the deal volume data we looked at earlier. For dollar volume, there appears to be no appreciable change in the “balance of power” between the two sub-regions since 2012. Depending on the year, East North Central states like Illinois, Michigan and Ohio raked in between 70 and 78 percent of total dollar volume, but that variance doesn’t appear in an orderly trend.

Where are most Midwestern deals done?

We started first at the regional level, then compared smaller groupings of states. Now, let’s see how deal and dollar volume is distributed on a state-by-state level. Doing so will point to the states that lead the region in venture-backed startup activity. Below, you’ll find a chart of how deal volume is split between the top five Midwestern states.

And here is how dollar volume is distributed.

As we saw with our analysis of the South, the top five Midwestern states for deal volume are the same five top-ranked states for dollar volume. But there is some notable variation in how these states rank among each other and the amount of deal and dollar volume they account for.

Considering that Illinois is home to Chicago and a number of downstate universities with deep tech startup roots, the fact that it places first for both metrics shouldn’t come as much of a surprise.

What might be more of a head-scratcher is Minnesota, which ranks third in deal volume but second in dollar volume. Why does it switch places with Ohio? The answer could lie in the industrial mix which, in the case of Minnesota, includes a disproportionately high number of medical device and other life sciences companies, which typically take a lot of capital to get off the ground.

The top Midwestern startup cities

Longtime readers of Crunchbase News may remember a ranking of Midwestern startup cities we wrote back in August 2017. However, here we’re just focusing on deal and dollar volume over the past 15 months, since the start of 2017.

Let’s start first with the top 10 Midwestern cities as measured by number of startup funding rounds.

And in the chart below, you can see the top cities, as ranked by venture dollar volume, from the same period of time.

In both rankings, four of the top five cities are the same, but the odd one out appears to be Columbus, Ohio. Although there were a fairly large number of rounds raised by startups in that metro area, most of the rounds were fairly small by national standards. And one of the main reasons why Kansas City, Missouri jumped so much in the dollar volume rankings was a $100 million Series F round raised by C2FO.

But, again, as far as the Midwest goes, everything pales in comparison to Chicago alone.

For many, the Midwest is in a kind of Goldilocks zone. The East and West coasts seem to hold more or less equal sway over the culture and economy and most of its cities are neither too big nor too small. The only extreme it seems to occupy is its winter weather.","As far as the amount of money Midwestern startups have raised over time, the trendline is generally up and to the right.

136,136,"Apr 6, 2019",KING5.com,Puppy named Apple sets ASPCA relocation milestone,"With her move from Mississippi to New York, the floppy-eared puppy is the 100,000th homeless animal relocated by the ASPCA.

A floppy-eared puppy named Apple has a new home in New York, courtesy of an animal protection group and an overcrowded shelter in Mississippi.

Two weeks after being rescued from the streets of Starkville, Mississippi, Apple arrived in New York City on Thursday as the 100,000th homeless animal relocated by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

About 100 people cheered as a relocation van arrived in Manhattan. Apple rode north in a crate with Curry, a Chihuahua mix that was with her when she was found in Mississippi.

Apple is cute and workers doubt the brown, short-haired mutt with hints of a black mask will spend much time in her temporary home at an adoption center before finding a permanent home.

""Apple isn't going to be around very long,"" said Laura Nelson, director of relocation outreach for the nonprofit organization.

Similar to a program that rounded up and moved homeless animals after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, the relocation effort began in 2014. It sends animals from areas with lots of strays or unwanted animals to areas where there's a large demand for rescue animals but a small supply.

In the West, the organization said, animals are typically relocated from Southern California to the Northwest; animals from Texas are sent as far north as the Great Lakes. A large number of animals come from the South, a fertile breeding ground for strays because of the verdant landscape and warm temperatures.

Since many communities in places like Mississippi and Alabama lack funding for programs to spay or neuter lots of animals, the relocation program frequently moves animals from there to places including New York and New England, where stray populations aren't as large but demand for animals is huge.

Holding Apple in her lap, board member Michele Anderson of the Oktibbeha County Humane Society in Mississippi said the transportation program saves the lives of animals that otherwise could wind up being euthanized.

""Until aggressive spay and neuter programs actually make a dent in reducing the large number of unwanted and neglected animals in our community, animal relocation is the only life-saving option for many of our animals,"" Anderson said.

ASPCA said 2018 was the program's busiest year yet, moving 29,360 dogs, 10,610 cats and 344 other animals across the country to make them eligible for adoption.

Apple and about two dozen other dogs made the 1,100-mile (1,770-kilometer) trip from Mississippi to New York over two days with an overnight stop in Virginia. They rode in a truck with a cargo area that includes individual crates, a climate control system and video monitoring.

Trisha Deaton, who has been driving a relocation truck for about a year, said the trips seem like an endless cycle, with so many homeless animals in some places and so much demand for animals in others.

""I couldn't give you an exact number, but I normally do about two a week,"" she said.

After a health check in New York, Apple and the 16 other dogs in her shipment will be put up for adoption. Any of them could get new names as they move to homes with new families, and that's fine with the workers and volunteers at the Mississippi shelter.

""We hope they get adopted quickly,"" Anderson said.

Alex Coats

by Brinda Fuller Willis

As a box-office manager for Ardenland, Alex Coats likes the challenges of his job, such as helping bring a variety of acts to the Jackson area and aiding in the creation a vibrant music scene in the city.

""I love the fact that I get to be a part of bringing live music to Mississippi while challenging myself to put the spotlight on a place that is so culturally rich and important to the global stage,"" he says.

The 24-year-old grew up in College Station, Texas, and earned a bachelor's degree in communications with a concentration in public relations from Mississippi State University in 2017. While studying at MSU, he helped organized concerts and other events such as Bulldog Bash, so after graduation, Arden Barnett of Ardenland offered him the box-office manager position.

Through his work there, Coats has helped bring a number of performers to the Jackson metropolitan area. Most recently, he and Ardenland worked with Cathead Distillery to organize Cathead Jam, which included acts such as Jackson-based Young Valley, The Revivalists, Aaron Lee Tasjan and more.

Outside of work, Coats enjoys spending time with friends, getting to know people and spending time with his girlfriend, Katie Demetz. He's an avid Houston Rockets fan, but he says, ""I'm pulling for the Raptors, but the Warriors will probably win the NBA championship.""

Arthur 'Reggie' Dampier

by Dustin Cardon

Arthur ""Reggie"" Dampier had initially wanted to become an orthopedic surgeon because of his love of sports; however, his plans changed when he participated in a health-career opportunities program at Jackson State University while attending the former St. Joseph Catholic School in Jackson. There, Dampier met Dewey Handy, an optometrist who currently practices at Merit Health Central in west Jackson.

""I wanted to be able to get to know each patient on a one-on-one, direct basis. I saw optometry as a great way to accomplish my goals of being an entrepreneur with my own practice and giving back to my community. I also knew I wanted to (come back to) Mississippi to do it,"" Dampier says.

He received his bachelor's degree from Xavier University in New Orleans, and then his Doctor of Optometry degree from the Southern College of Optometry in Memphis in 1997. He opened Ridgeland Eye Care Center in 2000. The practice has been in its current location in 2008.

Dampier likes to give back to the community. One way is through Optometry Giving Sight, a global fundraising initiative that helps train eye-care professionals and open optometry schools in countries that lack them. Dampier's clinic also collects donated glasses to send overseas with missionary groups, and in the past, he has given free eye exams through the Madison Lions Club. He is the secretary and vice president for the state board of optometry.

""Taking care of eyes is something I think I could do for free,"" Dampier says. ""It's fulfilling to help people with the precious gift of sight.""

D'Artagnan Winford

by Mauricio J. Quijano

It was during D'Artagnan Winford's senior year at Leflore County High School in Greenwood, Miss., that an art teacher gave him a book about jobs in art.

""Before then, I didn't know what I would study,"" Winford says. ""My mom told me to go with my God-given talent so I went with art.""

After graduating from high school in 1996, Winford enrolled in Mississippi Valley State University in his hometown, Itta Bena. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in art in 2002. That year, he began working for MVSU as a graphic designer.

Winford went to work at Jackson State University as its art director in 2013, and then started as senior art director for Ramey Agency in 2016, where he works on projects for clients from around the world.

In his spare time, Winford, 41, likes to help artists and those who promote the arts gain recognition.

""If I'm browsing through social media, and I see someone trying to get off the ground, and I like what they are doing but see that they could use some creative help, I'll offer my services,"" he says.

Winford designed the logo for local nonprofit Feed Jackson, which organizes Dining with Dignity, an annual event that feeds the homeless.

Lately, Winford has been using his photography to help promote local artists, including painters, dancers and singers. He opened a studio for his art and photography in Jackson in 2018.

""I just want to shine a light on the creative community. Jackson is full of talented artists,"" he says.

Winford has been married to Cheryl Winford for 14 years and has four children. While he does not force his children to follow similar paths, they have chosen to be involved in the arts as well.

""I like helping them to explore their creativity,"" he says of his kids.

Finley had connections to a nonprofit helping people with disabilities in finding jobs. In 2009, the group asked him to help them start a basketball program for Special Olympics.

""(Helping with) something like that was something I had never considered doing before,"" he says. ""But ... I decided to go along with it. Then, once I got involved and saw the wonderful experiences the athletes were having, I knew it was something I wanted to do.""

Finley, 45, was born in Michigan and attended Albion College in Albion, Mich., where he received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1995. He later received a master's degree in business administration from the University of Michigan in 2006. He worked as a supply executive for various automotive manufacturers after college, and then moved to Jackson in 2012.

In 2013, Finley helped Special Olympics Mississippi establish a track-and-field program, and a basketball program in 2014. He became an assistant coach in softball and flag football for the organization in 2015. He also serves on Special Olympics' statewide board of directors and as chairman of the board.

""It's great to see athletes, especially from low-income areas without a lot of experiences with structured sports, become more well-rounded, thrive and excel after being exposed to it,"" he says.

Wayne Ferrell

by Mike McDonald

Wayne Ferrell once worked a case litigating a plane crash in Iceland. The plane was refurbished as a former vessel for drug runs in South America.

""The plane was involved in a crash before and should never have flown again,"" the attorney says.

Ferrell negotiated a sizeable settlement for the people killed in the crash.

""We got very close to the families,"" he says. ""We invited them over to the states, went to a baseball game.""

For the most part, Wayne Ferrell has remained in Mississippi all his life. He was born in Pascagoula in 1946 and, shortly afterward, he moved to Iowa when he was six months old.

""I was raised as a farm boy,"" he says. ""I knew I didn't want to stay there long because I didn't like the cold.""

Ferrell attended high school in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and then moved back to Pascagoula in 1962.

After earning a bachelor's degree in business and economics in 1969 from Millsaps College, he joined the U.S. Air Force.

He graduated from Jackson School of Law, now Mississippi College, with his law degree in 1975. He then received his Masters of Law degree in air and space law from McGill University in Canada in 1981.

""It seemed right to go into aviation law after the Air Force,"" he says.

Ferrell has owned his solo practice in downtown Jackson since 1995. His firm focuses on litigation, product liability law, commercial law, aviation law and environmental law.

He has also served with Team JXN since the beginning of the group.

""I've been working downtown since the '80s,"" he says. ""You go to Nashville, and it has a vibrant downtown, very clean. This area should be the center of activity.

""I have (acquaintances) who won't come down here. But I haven't had any problems. We're close to Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta, New Orleans. ... Jackson should be the crossroads of the South, there's no doubt in my mind,"" Ferrell adds.

Hugh Hollowell Jr.

by Mike McDonald

Hugh Hollowell Jr. had a job in Memphis, Tenn., earning a six-figure salary. He even dropped out of college because the employment opportunity was so lucrative. However, he began to wonder about his legacy.

""I had one of those quarter-life crises,"" Hollowell says.

The Byhalia, Miss., native had gone north to attend the University of Memphis from 1993 to 1996. He worked at New York Life and ING from 1996 to 2003, when he decided to quit, choosing instead to open used bookstore Midtown Books there. ""I went from earning $100,000 to about $18,000 so it was a big change,"" he says.

During his time in Memphis, Hollowell also got to know some of the homeless people in the city.

""That's one of the reasons I got interested (in that problem),"" he says. He wanted to help them.

Hollowell moved to North Carolina, where he had the opportunity to tackle homelessness. He lived there during his 30s and founded a nonprofit, Love Wins Ministries, dedicated to the intertwined struggle of hunger and homelessness.

He worked and lived in Raleigh for 12 years and then moved to Jackson in 2018 to be closer to his family. When he came here, he also wanted to use his background and knowledge to help solve a problem. Now, Hollowell continues his work to alleviate hunger and food insecurity within the capital city. He directs and operates Jackson City Farm, a collective of land plots in west and south Jackson. One is near the Metrocenter Mall, another near George Elementary and the third off Highway 18. The overarching goal of Jackson City Farm is to feed people in need.

""We're partnering with Stewpot to bring those served by the Stewpot organization healthy food which they use to serve meals,"" Hollowell says.

Jackson City Farm currently has two plots with fruits and vegetables, and the organization is working to clear a third one.

""I want people to know they have options when it comes to fresh food,"" Hollowell says.

Lance Wheeler

by Dustin Cardon

Lance Wheeler, curator of exhibits at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, credits his love of history to his late great uncle, Clarence Ball, who passed away at age 104 in 2016. Wheeler spoke with Ball, who was a World War II veteran, at length for a college senior thesis about the obstacles African Americans faced during the Jim Crow era.

""My uncle had to combat Jim Crow every step of the way, and having him share his experiences first-hand gave me a deep appreciation for our history,"" Wheeler says of the eye-opening experience.

""Sometimes stories can be lost if we wait too long to hear them, so I'm glad to have gotten that history, the oral history, of my family from him while I could.""

Wheeler has held his position since Oct. 1, 2017. He is primarily responsible for maintaining the museum's permanent galleries, as well as overseeing the creation and installation of temporary and traveling exhibitions.

He also organizes programs to accompany exhibits in the permanent galleries. In January 2019, he created MLK Poetry Night, which featured poetry performances honoring civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Wheeler also developed a program for young visitors titled ""Read,"" in which the museum brings in special guests such as Jackson first lady Ebony Lumumba to read books for children.

""Many think history is boring because they think it's about dates and dead people,"" Wheeler says. ""It becomes much more personal when you can find personal connections in it.""

Travis Crabtree

by Dustin Cardon

Travis Crabtree, who has served as a city planner for the City of Jackson since 2018, says he has been fascinated with the idea of public and outdoor spaces since he was a child.

""I've always been interested in the variety of different places and geographies in Mississippi's landscape and how they all differ, with everything from pine forests to wetlands,"" he says. ""Public spaces and urban design connect everything you see and how you interact with your environment.""

Crabtree was born in Dallas and moved to Jackson with his mother as a teenager in the early 2000s. He attended St. Joseph Catholic School and received his bachelor's degree in landscape architecture from Mississippi State University in 2014. He moved to Detroit after graduating and received a master's degree in urban design from the University of Michigan in 2016.

He fiancee Salam Rida, who is also a city planner, moved to Jackson in 2017.

Crabtree has dedicated his time in Jackson to developing public spaces such as parks and working to bring more public transportation into the city.

After he took office, Crabtree partnered with Rida and City Department of Planning and Development Director Mukesh Kumar to establish the city's long-range planning division.

Crabtree has overseen the transformation of a parking area on Congress Street into a small park called a parklet; a bike and foot traffic-friendly transportation corridor called ONELINE; and the Fertile Ground initiative, which created murals and art installations throughout the city to raise awareness about food access.

Crabtree, Rida and others are also developing the Ecoshed near Fondren.

""I want to help people be engaged with their city and create places that can be both be productive and serve as a place where people can gather and interact,"" Crabtree says of his passion.

Joshua Wright

by Donna Ladd

Joshua Wright was a Clinton High School sophomore when he showed up for the Mississippi Youth Media Project, which I founded, in 2016. Over two summers, I watched Wright grow into a leader. Then last summer, he was a paid video mentor for other YMP students, modeling more than technology.

""I'm learned how to not always push my ideas,"" Wright says. ""I learned to listen to other people's ideas, get constructive criticism. Let people get their ideas out. To step back."" He now confronts problems head-on, such as talking directly to students who don't act ethically or fairly.

Now 18, and headed to Rust College on a full scholarship, his mother Venetia Miller raised him alone, and well. ""I was trying to find who am I as a person—who do I want to be and what do I want to accomplish after high school?"" he says.

Wright will study broadcast communications, then work in radio or TV. He prepped by taping football games and practices, livestreaming events, and working on yearbook and newspaper staffs.

""I started growing as a person,"" he says. ""I started speaking in churches. I got the call. I also got the call that I wanted to do media work, camera work.""

Wright also had to find a way to pay for college. ""School is expensive,"" he says.

He landed at least six scholarship offers, four of them full rides. He plans to get involved in Rust student government and the local NAACP chapter, and is already selected to sing in the a capella choir.

""It's good to get away and branch out,"" Wright says. ""At the same time, I hate to leave my mom alone.""

Wyatt Waters

by Brinda Fuller Willis

Wyatt Waters's favorite way to paint is plein air, or on location.

""I like looking at life as it is,"" Waters says.

Jacksonians often see him in different locations in the city, painting different scenes, whether it be the Walker's Drive-In sign or even on location at events such as the annual WellsFest Art Night.

Eudora Welty's book ""One time, One Place,"" was an inspiration for Waters when he was studying art at Mississippi College.

""She took photographs of people and places just as they were, no frills, no added prompt and circumstance,"" he says.

The Brookhaven, Miss., native moved to Florence and then Clinton as a teenager. He received a bachelor's degree in art from Mississippi College in 1980. While at MC, Waters studied under Sam Gore, who inspired him to experiment with watercolor.

Waters' need to paint ""en plein air"" has led him to different places, including cities around Mississippi such as Oxford and other countries such as Italy. His work has been featured at locations such as the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art in Laurel, the Meridian Museum of Art and the Jackson Municipal Art Gallery.

Waters collaborated with chef and friend Robert St. John on four books: ""A Southern Palate,"" ""Southern Seasons,"" ""An Italian Palate"" and ""A Mississippi Palate."" His new book ""An Italian Travel Journal"" arrives in October 2020.

""I take pleasure in just looking at things as they are,"" Waters says. ""Things are never the way we think they are; there's always a story inside of what you are looking at.""","He graduated from Jackson School of Law, now Mississippi College, with his law degree in 1975.

138,138,"Feb 6, 2020",Key West Florida Weekly,Laissez Les Bons “Conchs” Rouler At SOUTHERNMOST MARDI GRAS,"On Monday, March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorers Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, and Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, landed on the west bank of the Mississippi River about 60 miles downriver from New Orleans. The following day was cause for double celebration — not only had the brothers discovered new(ish) territory, but it was also Mardi Gras, the Roman Catholic French tradition that encouraged the faithful to indulge in a bit of revelry prior to the 40-day ascetic fasting period of Lent. On the night before Ash Wednesday in the old country, the lack of refrigeration meant that all of the meat, cheese and milk had to be consumed, lest it go to waste while the household fasted. Hence, Mardi Gras, or, as we know it, Fat Tuesday.

Back in the New World, Bienville went on to found Mobile, Ala., the first capital of French Louisiana, where French settlers began to celebrate Mardi Gras in 1703. In 1723, the capital was moved to New Orleans and the growth of the city plus its Creole connections made fertile ground for Fat Tuesday to take root, grow and mutate like a debauched weed. Today, Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans draw hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city to attend parades and parties and pack the Big Easy from end to end.

Key West may not sit on a bayou or have deep French roots, but it’s been said on more than one occasion that New Orleans and Key West are kind of like sister cities. For starters, the oppressive humidity is overwhelming, whether you’re on Smathers Beach or strolling the Garden District. The Southernmost and Crescent cities are both known for their laid-back, live-and-let-live vibes. Our literary histories run deep, with Key West laying claim to Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway, both of whom were known to tipple in the Big Easy. And above all else, we both love a good time.

Now, Key West certainly isn’t looking to steal anyone’s Fat Tuesday thunder, but if you know anything about this fun-loving town, you know that we can’t resist a good party — especially if that party includes music, mirth and more than a little giggle juice. We don’t have 300-plus years of masquerading tradition to build upon, but Key West’s is finally ready to host is first Mardi Gras festival on Sunday, Feb. 9, at the Coffee Butler Key West Amphitheater — but we’re doing it our way.

To lend things that jubilant Mardi Gras air, Rams Head is bringing in New Orleans musician Troy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews, who will represent the Krewe of Freret as the Grand Marshall of their Mardi Gras parade next week in the Crescent City. Along with a performance by Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue, you can expect the likes of Big Sam’s Funky Nation and Grammy nominees Tank and The Bangas. Returning to Key West for the first time since 2018 will be Rebirth Brass Band, who are known for combining the traditional New Orleans brass band sound with hip hop, jazz, soul and funk.

According to Anthony VanDaley, director of operations and marketing for Rams Head and the acting manager of the Coffee Butler Amphitheater, the music was just the first building block in creating a Mardi Gras party that will cement our New Orleans connection. “We booked these four really great New Orleans bands and then realized that Key West doesn’t have any type of Mardi Gras celebration,” he says. “We have Fat Tuesday’s and that’s about it. People always compare Key West to New Orleans, so we thought it would be perfect to turn this concert into a festival, especially now that we have the space at the amphitheater. These musicians are really going to bring the feel of New Orleans right to Key West.”

Unlike some of the New Orleans Mardi Gras activities (Google Krewe du Vieux — we’ll wait), this family-friendly event will include fun for all ages. Children 10 and under are free and the whole family can enjoy face painting, a bounce house and a masquerade mask decorating station.

“We’re really committed to making this a family-friendly community event,” Van- Daley emphasizes. “Between the bounce house, the face painter and the Mardi Gras mask creation station, we’re really hoping to provide activities for kids of all ages in a safe and comfortable environment.”

No Mardi Gras festival worth its salt happens without beads (environmentally unfriendly though they usually are), so local organization MARC House will be selling and distributing beads at the amphitheater all day. In order to avoid waste and eco-destroying disposal so close to the Gulf of Mexico, MARC will also be collecting and recycling all bead necklaces in designated bins when the festival comes to an end.

For this midnight snacker, the best part of New Orleans is the food — crawfish, étouffée, beignets, bananas foster … sigh. The organizers of the Southernmost Mardi Gras Festival agree, so you can expect a great mix of NOLA-inspired fare from multiple food vendors. Chef Michael Torres from Tempt at The Saint Hotel restaurant will be on site cheffing up authentic Cajun bites like pulled pork in a Creole sauce, NOLA-style gumbo, king cake and more. Joey’s Bag o’ Donuts will be switching things up and serving beignets from their food truck while Endless Summer Grill is perfecting andouille sausage with all the fixings. Clemente’s will be rolling in its trolley with an across the board favorite: hand-tossed and wood-fired pizza.

For the drink connoisseur in your group, Fat Tuesday’s is donating frozen hurricanes and piña coladas, which will be served in a collectible and reusable cup, Multiple pop-up bars will be offering surprise craft beers (fingers crossed for Abita Purple Haze!), mixed drinks and domestic beer. The vendor marketplace will feature exclusively local vendors, including Lost Boy Creations, Concrete Ship Mercantile, An Elegant Touch Art & Engraving and Sandbar Clothing.

Though Key West’s one-day festival is a mere fraction of the weeklong celebration that consumes New Orleans, the goal is to grow the Southernmost Mardi Gras to be a complement to its Creole counterpart, if not in size, then at least in heart. “We’re really hoping to build and evolve year over year,” VanDaley says. “This year we have four bands, Cajun food, a partnership with The Saint Hotel (which has a sister property in New Orleans) and an after-party Fat Tuesday’s. Next year, we’d love to be able to plan a parade — even if it’s just down Duval Street to the amphitheater. Each year, we’ll change up the bands and get bigger and bigger, which will hopefully put us on the map of Mardi Gras celebration destinations. ¦","Hence, Mardi Gras, or, as we know it, Fat Tuesday.

0,0,"Dec 4, 2019",The New York Times,Hundreds of Thousands Are Losing Access to Food Stamps,"Under the rule, effective April 1, 2020, an area eligible for a waiver would have to have a 24-month average unemployment rate that is not only 20 percent above the national average but also at least 6 percent.

Anti-poverty groups said the administration’s focus on the unemployment rate was misleading.

“The overall unemployment rate is really a measure of the whole labor market and not people without a high school diploma who are incredibly poor and may lack transportation,” said Stacy Dean, the vice president for food assistance policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We’re talking about a different group who just face a very different labor market.”

The rule is the first of three Agriculture Department efforts to scale back the food stamp program, and so far, Trump administration officials appear unmoved by the protests flooding in. More than 140,000 public comments were submitted on the rule that was made final on Wednesday, and they were overwhelmingly negative.

“The Trump administration is driving the vulnerable into hunger just as the Christmas season approaches,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday. “It is heartless. It is cruel. It exposes a deep and shameful cruelness and hypocrisy in this administration.”

The department has also proposed a rule that would close what it calls a loophole that allows people with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four — to receive food stamps. The rule would also prevent households with more than $2,250 in assets, or $3,500 for a household with a disabled adult, from receiving food stamps. Those changes would strip nearly three million people of their benefits, the department said, and nearly one million children would lose automatic eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals.

-----------

Following the massive ICE operation in Mississippi on Aug. 7, many children are left without a mother or father and have nowhere to go.

But a community in Forest, Mississippi, is coming together with a temporary solution.

The children, some who are just toddlers, were relying on neighbors and even strangers to pick them up outside their homes after school and drive them to a community fitness center where people tried to keep them calm.

But many kids kept crying for mom and dad.

Fighting back tears, 11-year-old Magdalena Gomez Gregorio expressed to us her devastation being alone without her dad.

""Government please show some heart, let my parent be free and everyone else,"" she said.

This came after ice agents raided several food processing plants in Mississippi, arresting 680 people believed to be in the country illegally.

""While we are a nation of immigrants, more than that we are first and foremost a nation of laws,"" said Southern District U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst.

But those children and families impacted by each raid stressed their parents and friends are good people.

""I need my dad and mommy. My dad didn't do anything, he's not a criminal,"" said Magdalena.

""The children that I'm with, their moms been here for 15 years and she has no record. A lot of people here have no record they've been here for 10-12 years,"" said Christina Peralta, godmother of kids impacted.

For Christina Peralta, who's the godmother of two children who's mom was arrested, she's helpless as she watches the boys wonder when they'll see their mother again.

""He said his mom is gone, that he's upset with Trump. He said he just wants his mom back and they've been crying all day long since they got home from school,"" Peralta.

But with the help of Clear Creek Boot Camp owner Jordan Barnes and other community leaders, the kids will have a roof to sleep under at his gym for the night with donated food to eat.

""We're going to have bedding available for them and we're going to have food available for them just to get them through the night and if they need transportation to school tomorrow we'll also take care of that,"" said Barnes.

And in times like these, he stresses that you cannot forget the children through this.

""I understand the law and how everything works and everything needs to have a system, but everybody needs to hold the kids first and foremost in their minds. And that's what we've tried to do here is give them a place to stay and ease the pain a little bit,"" Barnes said.

According to the Associated Press, dozens of immigrant workers have already been released.

Officials had said Wednesday that they would release detainees who met certain conditions, such as pregnant women or those who hadn't faced immigration proceedings previously.","But a community in Forest, Mississippi, is coming together with a temporary solution.

2,2,"th · Aug 9, 2019",Reuters,Allegations of labor abuses dogged Mississippi plant years before immigration raids,"(Reuters) - Long before U.S. immigration authorities arrested 680 people at agricultural processing facilities in Mississippi this week, one of the five targeted companies faced allegations of serious labor violations including intimidation, harassment and exploitation of its largely immigrant work force, according to a federal lawsuit.

Last August, Illinois-based poultry supplier Koch Foods settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of more than 100 workers at the Morton, Mississippi, plant over claims the company knew - or should have known - of sexual and physical assaults against its Hispanic workers.

Mark Kaminsky, chief operating officer at Koch, said the company admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and maintains, after fighting the matter in court for more than eight years, that all the allegations contained in the lawsuit are false.

The workers’ complaints spanned 2004 to 2008, when the plant employed more than 500 people. They alleged that a manager would grope women from behind while they were working, punch employees and throw chicken parts at them. Workers also alleged that supervisors coerced payments from them for everything from medical leave and promotions to bathroom breaks.

Privately held Koch Foods, run by billionaire Joseph Grendys, in court filings called the claims of abuse and harassment “baffling” and “outrageous.” Kaminsky said a third-party review of 9 months of 24-hour video surveillance at the plant found “absolutely no evidence” of their veracity. Koch said the plaintiffs made uncorroborated claims against the company as a means to obtain U.S. visas for crime victims who collaborate with U.S. authorities that would allow them to stay legally in the United States.

The company settled the allegations last year by paying $3.75 million and entering a three-year consent decree to prevent future violations. It agreed to implement new policies such as creating a 24-hour complaint hotline and publicly posting anti-discrimination policies, according to the EEOC.

Some workers at the Mississippi plant who lacked legal immigration status alleged in court documents that supervisors threatened to turn them in to authorities if they spoke out about their concerns.

Former federal officials and immigration attorneys said mass deportation operations like the ones conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday in Mississippi can have a chilling effect on future labor complaints.

“If workers are being threatened with being turned over to ICE, and then here comes ICE and arrests workers,” people could be more reluctant to speak up, said John Sandweg, a former acting ICE director during the Obama administration.

In the EEOC lawsuit, one Koch Foods employee without legal immigration status alleged that a manager sexually harassed his wife and made him pay to use the bathroom, once waiting until he had soiled himself to give him permission to leave his spot on the production line.

“If he found out that I had talked about anything that he was doing, charging money, the way he mistreated us, the dirty words he used; he told me that if I went to complain in the office that he had contacts in immigration,” the worker said in a 2012 deposition that was filed as part of the suit. “And that he knew where I lived.”

Maria Cazorla, a Cuban immigrant and lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the company that was wrapped into the EEOC case, said in an interview on Thursday that a manager inappropriately touched her and hit her then-husband, also a co-worker, in the ribs while he was working.

According to Cazorla’s interview and court documents, her husband at the time was targeted by management and fired over his immigration status after she filed her lawsuit against the company in 2010. Cazorla, now a U.S. citizen, left the company and Mississippi and now renovates houses in Florida.

She said immigrants are often fearful of reporting abuse. “People are afraid to come forward because they think, ‘What will happen if I say something? I’ll be separated from my family, I’ll lose my job,’” Cazorla said. “They prefer to say nothing and suffer.”

The EEOC enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and can investigate employee complaints. The agency tries to settle the claims but, if unsuccessful, it can file a lawsuit against employers for workplace discrimination.

Marsha Rucker, EEOC Regional Attorney based in Birmingham, Alabama, who oversaw the lawsuit, said she did not believe the ICE action this week was connected to the EEOC’s civil complaint.

SCENES OF MASS ARRESTS

The dramatic operation on Wednesday was the biggest workplace immigration sweep since December 2006, when ICE targeted meatpacking plants in six states and arrested almost 1,300 people.

Some children of workers were left traumatized by their parents’ detention on what was for many the first day of school, according to local media reports.

“Government, please,” an 11-year-old girl said on a CBS News segment, weeping in front of a community center where she and other children were sent to spend the night. “My dad didn’t do nothing. He’s not a criminal.”

President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration and said on Friday that actions like the one this week served “as a very good deterrent” to those in the country illegally. “When people see what they saw,” he said, “they know that they’re not staying here.”

ICE officials told reporters on a call on Thursday that they had released 303 people for humanitarian reasons - if they were pregnant or a primary caretaker of children, for example. Among those released pending a hearing before an immigration judge were 18 “juveniles” who had been working in the plants, including one 14-year-old, ICE said.

Koch Foods said in a statement on its website dated Thursday that it was cooperating with the government’s ongoing investigation following the ICE arrests. Koch said the Morton, Mississippi, plant employs more than 1,000 people and that the company is “diligent about its compliance with state and federal employment eligibility laws.”

The company has been the target of ICE work site enforcement in the past.

In August 2007, immigration agents arrested more than 160 employees of a Koch Foods chicken plant in Fairfield, Ohio, and was fined around a half a million dollars. At the time, ICE said Koch Foods was being investigated for federal crimes including encouraging, inducing or harboring immigrants in the United States illegally.

Koch Foods, which according to its website is not affiliated with Koch Industries or the Koch brothers, started with 13 employees deboning and cutting up chicken in one room in 1985. It now counts more than 13,000 employees and bills itself as one of the biggest poultry processors in the United States, with facilities in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and Illinois, as well as Mississippi.

In a letter to the White House, the National Chicken Council - a lobbying group - said the poultry industry “uses every tool available to verify the identify and legal immigration status of all prospective employees.” But it said there was no government system available to “confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in the United States.”","Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Handout via REUTERS/File PhotoLast August, Illinois-based poultry supplier Koch Foods settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by the U.S.

4,4,"Feb 26, 2020",Jackson Free Press,Jackson's Food Insecurity Focus in April Expo,"In a state where one in four children go to bed hungry at night, solutions to the food insecurity that plagues Jackson and other southern cities are the goal of a series of public art installations and workshops. The Fertile Ground Expo, scheduled for April 9-11, aims to address the history and future of food access in Mississippi and beyond.

""We know when you are hungry, you can't perform at your best,"" Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at a press conference Tuesday in downtown Jackson. ""Hunger is a problem that reaches beyond one's belly but affects every aspect of a person's way of life, which ultimately impacts how we function as a society.""

Agriculture may be the state's leading industry, but Mississippi remains one of the hungriest in the country, Salam Rida pointed out at the presser. She is a program manager for the expo and an urban designer for the City of Jackson.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" In a recent report, the department revealed that more than 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2018.

Mississippi has consistently ranked as one of the most food-insecure states in the nation. Between 2010 and 2018, the state ranked No. 1 in food insecurity. It also has the highest poverty rate.

One in four Mississsippians—more than 600,000 people—experience food insecurity. The issue is especially profound for the state's elderly population and children. Half the state's senior population does not have enough to eat, and about 25% of Mississippi's children go to sleep hungry.

The Mississippi Food Network reports that in Hinds County alone, nearly 62,000 people have too little to eat—more than the entire food-insecure population of North Dakota.

Food insecurity has multiple adverse health impacts, ranging from developmental problems for young people to difficulties concentrating in school. Given that nutritious foods tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods, families struggling with food access are more likely to eat foods that are detrimental to their overall physical health. Experts also link food insecurity to additional problems such as housing access and inadequate access to medical care.

The USDA notes that a number of state-level factors affect the degree to which a state experiences food insecurity. These include wages, housing costs and unemployment as well as ""State-level policies that affect access to unemployment insurance, the State Earned Income Tax Credit, and nutrition assistance programs.""

""The goal of the expo weekend is not only to be critical of our existing food system, but to provide new ideas and solutions for developing a more food-secure environment for southern cities,"" Rida said.

Scheduled to take place in various Jackson neighborhoods experiencing food-access issues, the Fertile Ground Expo will bring together prominent area and national chefs, nutritionists, farmers, activists, artists, and policy makers for workshops, dialogues and exhibits related to food. More than 30 events will tackle topics including the history of food insecurity, how to ferment food, urban farming, food waste, the food traditions of Farish Street, the impact of food insecurity on families and more.

The event is free.

Participants include acclaimed artist Kara Walker, chef and food writer Mark Bittman, local chef Nick Wallace and interdisciplinary Mississippi artist Adrienne Domnick.

The mayor thanked Bloomberg Philanthropy for its $1-million gift to organize the expo. In 2018, Jackson became one of five cities that the philanthropic organization selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants as part of its Public Art Challenge competition. At the Feb. 25 press conference, Lumumba added that Bloomberg Philanthropy work was independent of Mike Bloomberg's campaign for the presidency, while emphasizing the need to focus on the problem of hunger.

""We live in a world of abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity. In our society, there is no room or justification for anyone to go hungry, for anyone not to have access to healthy food options,"" the mayor said at the press conference, adding that food is how Mississippians show love in their communities.

""Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. In spaces where people often have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you and provide you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. As a city, we should return the love,"" he said.

Mississippi Clarion Ledger

As thousands of Mississippians face layoffs or income cuts from the economic fallout of coronavirus, the state's welfare agency is taking action to support families on food assistance programs.

The Mississippi Department of Human Services announced on Monday that recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will begin receiving the maximum amount of SNAP funds allowable — regardless of what they were entitled to receive under normal circumstances.

A press release from the agency explained if a single person was currently getting $100 in SNAP benefits, that person will now automatically get the maximum monthly amount for a single person: $194.

This emergency supplement will apply to March and April benefits, according to the release.

“Our primary commitment is, and always will be, helping Mississippi families when they need it most, especially during this time when so many lives are being affected,” MDHS Executive Director Bob Anderson said in the release. “We will continually make every effort to provide assistance to children and families who need it, especially in the face of the unprecedented effects of this pandemic.”

COVID-19: We are answering your questions about the coronavirus pandemic

If you or your family is already receiving SNAP benefits, this bump will happen automatically.

Families who qualify for SNAP benefits and are not currently receiving them are encouraged to apply by going to www.mdhs.ms.gov/applications. Applicants can also apply via mail, the press release said, though this will delay the process.

Here are the amounts of monthly SNAP benefits available under the emergency supplement, broken down by the number of people in the household:

1: $194

2: $355

3: $509

4: $646

5: $768

6: $921

7: $1,018

8: $1,164

9: $1,310

9,9,"Aug 13, 2019",Atlanta Journal Constitution,Poultry company raided by ICE in Mississippi also operates in Georgia,"ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said he would not discuss if and when his agency would carry out similar enforcement in Georgia.

“While we cannot speculate to the future, at present it does not encompass any locations in Georgia,” he said.

Federal authorities executed search warrants at seven sites across Mississippi last week, arresting 680 people suspected of being in the country illegally. Of those, 303 were placed in deportation proceedings and released from custody and 377 are still detained at facilities in Louisiana and Mississippi. The arrests, according to ICE, stemmed from a yearlong investigation.

ICE said in court records that the Koch Foods plant in Morton drew the agency’s attention after it tracked unauthorized immigrants to that location, using coordinates from federal electronic monitoring ankle bracelets.

In 2006 in Georgia, federal authorities raided a chicken processing plant in Stillmore and several homes in and around Emanuel County in east Georgia. More than 120 people suspected of being in the country illegally, mostly men, were arrested.

Afterward, many people went into hiding or left town, failing to show up for their jobs at the lumber yards, steel mills and produce companies across the county and in neighboring communities. Many women and children were left behind, some without resources. Small local businesses reported suffering losses.

Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, fears Georgia could experience something like that again following the events in Mississippi.

“If we were to remove undocumented workers from the picture, our poultry industry would collapse in Georgia,” he said. “Our economy would take a serious hit, and it would be destructive to families all around this state.”

Georgia's poultry industry — it employs tens of thousands of workers across the state and generates billions of dollars in economic activity — follows state and federal employment laws, said Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation, a trade association.

“My members are literally doing everything they can with the tools they have at their disposal to ensure they are hiring a legal workforce,” he said.

The National Chicken Council, a nonprofit trade group that represents the broiler chicken industry, sent President Donald Trump a letter Friday, saying ""the government does not provide employers with a reliable verification method to prevent identity fraud and document falsification and confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in the United States.""

Also on Friday, three Democratic congressmen — including Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi — asked the Trump administration to turn over documents about the costs of the raids, how many people were detained and how many families with children were split up.

The issue has already resonated among several of the Democrats running to represent Georgia’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses Cumming and rural portions of Forsyth County. Some shared stories on social media of the children whose parents were taken by federal agents during the Mississippi raids. And some, including party activist Nabilah Islam and state Rep. Brenda Lopez Romero, said what happened in Mississippi underscores the need for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.

""If you like to eat vegetables or any meat, you're relying on the fact that that food is available because of undocumented labor,"" said Lopez Romero, an immigration attorney who has put the issue at the heart of her bid for Congress. The way to ""minimize the effects on U.S. citizen children is by making sure we have a pathway to regularizing one's status (for their parents) so there's an actual line to get into.""

U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, who represents a largely rural southwest Georgia district, said he is concerned because “Georgia produces more poultry than any other state in the nation, and the poultry industry, and most of agriculture, rely heavily on immigrant and guest worker labor. We need a comprehensive immigration bill that will ensure agriculture employers have the legal workers that they need to keep American agriculture the most productive in the world.”

10,10,"Apr 6, 2020",The Guardian,"In the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, a virus hits home: 'Hunger is rampant'","On the cracked country roads of Lexington, deep in the Mississippi delta, an empty yellow school bus drives slowly, making life-sustaining drop-offs on the way.

Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection. There has been one recorded Covid-19 death in the county, Clinton Cobbins, Lexington’s first African American mayor. But even now the coronavirus still poses a serious threat to life.

In Holmes county consolidated – the school district to which Lexington belongs – every single child qualifies for free school meals, a marker of pervasive poverty. For many, said the superintendent, Dr James L Henderson, breakfast and lunch at school are the only nutritious meals a student will eat in a day. For a few, they are the only meals.

When the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.

Many children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.

“We absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,” he said. “We have to do it on behalf of our children. It’s just that simple. Families are suffering here.”

“If there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we’re providing for all children.

The novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America’s most food-insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food-insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.

As the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages – two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.

His mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.

“With the money that we do have we’ve got to try and pay the bills,” she said. “And when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.”

At the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.

Quick Guide How you can help US food banks in the Covid-19 pandemic Show How to help Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help. Donate money or supplies The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families. If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund. Volunteers Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice. Social media Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.

“This is getting so much harder,” she said. “We’re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.”

Holmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.

Zelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call-in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices – in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.

“I couldn’t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,” she said. “So I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said ‘I’m not paying’. My brain just melted because I was so upset.”

In a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington’s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.

“If people have a problem they should report it to the attorney general of Mississippi,” he said. “We’re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.”

Mississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared with other hotspots in the US – particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.

As the school bus food drop-offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.

“I pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,” Reeves said.

But the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.

“Hunger is rampant here,” said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. “Six hundred thousand were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.”

The network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state’s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.

“We have more phone calls than we can handle,” Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.

‘It’s like a scavenger hunt’

In Jackson, the state’s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods.

Like Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pickup meal service there are no drop-offs here.

April Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.

Volunteers from the Poor People’s Campaign, and Operation Good – a local collective of activists – have been organizing hot food drop-offs at this low-income apartment complex, for the past week.

“It’s like a scavenger hunt,” Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. “People are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.”

She lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.

“I just took it,” she said. “I bought a block of cheese. That was it.”","Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection.

11,11,1 week ago,Direct Relief,"In Mississippi, Working to Treat Food Insecurity","At one of the oldest community health centers in the country – that’s Delta Health Center in Mississippi – there’s a story about a famous doctor who used to write prescriptions for food.

Dr. Jack Geiger, the founding father of the community health center movement, would send his patients to the grocery store to get healthy food. The grocer would fill the order and send the bill to the health center.

Someone told Geiger that food couldn’t be prescribed. Geiger retorted that the best cure he knew for malnutrition was food.

Robin Boyles, who’s now the chief program planning and development officer at Delta, said that treating food insecurity “really does go back to our very, very early days…You can treat someone for an illness or infection, but if you’re sending them home and they don’t have food to eat and they don’t have clean drinking water and they don’t have sanitation, they’re not going to get well.”

Food insecurity is on the rise across the United States. In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average. A 2019 study from the USDA’s Economic Research Service found that the state had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country – 15.7% of the population experienced it.

And the state’s community health centers are coming together to do something about it – together with the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi and Direct Relief. Direct Relief provided the health center association with a $250,000 grant designed to fight hunger among Mississippi’s most vulnerable.

The result is the Cornbread Cooking Series, a program that’s designed to both increase access to food and teach people how to buy and prepare food that’s healthy and good to eat. Six Mississippi health centers will introduce or build on existing programs around food access and education.

“It’s Southern and everybody loves cornbread…it’s winter and it’s comfort,” said Janice Sherman, the association’s CEO.

But despite the homey name, Sherman is focused on new cooking techniques as well as food access. “I thought it would be an opportunity to really introduce some new areas of spices and things that will really be better for our diets,” she said.

Patients are screened for food insecurity. If they qualify, they’re referred to the program, which provides a combination of education, activities, and food vouchers or other access to healthy, nutritious food.

Sherman explained that health centers, as trusted community resources, are in an especially good position to deliver help and education. “For a provider who’s your doctor to address the fact that you need food is pretty powerful,” she said.

Three health centers participating in the program sat down with Direct Relief to talk about hunger, healthy cooking, and how they’ll use the funding.

For Patients with HIV, Closing the Cracks

At G.A. Carmichael Family Health Center, dietician Kyskie Bolton explained that there are a number of patients who are “dramatically food insecure, but don’t fall into any category where they would get significant assistance.”

In participating in the Cornbread Cooking Series, G.A. Carmichael wanted to focus on the patients who most needed intervention – in this case, by focusing on patients dealing with both food insecurity and HIV/AIDS.

Some of those patients have comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes as well.

Bolton explained that HIV-positive patients often don’t want anyone to know their diagnosis. “They will protect it at all costs, even at the cost of their hunger or nutritional health,” she said. “These are the type of patients who are going to fall through the cracks.”

G.A. Carmichael is preparing videos of healthy cooking techniques – how to prepare vegetables, for example – and a supermarket tour, to show patients who qualify for the program how to shop around the edges of the grocery store for the healthiest food.

The goal, Bolton said, is “increasing their literacy and empowering them to make better decisions so they can utilize what they have.”

The health center is also working with nearby farmers to acquire and distribute produce to patients with chronic diseases – a long-term enterprise that the funding will help them continue. Active participants in the program will also receive vouchers and gift cards to nearby grocery stores.

For Bolton, part of the challenge is reaching a diverse patient population – one that’s both rural and relatively urban, and that includes a range of ethnicities and backgrounds – and produce materials and messaging that will appeal to everyone.

However, the population does have one thing in common: “Most people here are extremely technologically advanced and don’t have much to do with cornbread,” Bolton said.

Reducing Childhood Obesity

For Dr. Wendy Williams, a pediatrician at Coastal Family Health Center, an interest in increasing food access came about when she noticed a correlation between food insecurity and obesity in the children in her practice.

“Until we started asking the questions, I had no idea how pervasive [food insecurity] is down here,” she said. “You can’t get to the bottom of pediatric obesity until you conquer that, or at least make some dents.”

The health center started by planting a vegetable garden to teach kids about healthy food. It met an enthusiastic reception: Williams said that one child described a radish as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen before putting it in his pocket to preserve it. Another was anxious to learn to grow food – his uncle, he told Williams, didn’t have enough to eat.

The Cornbread Cooking Series grant will help Coastal Family Health Center expand its program, reaching out to local farmers to acquire excess produce for patients, and launching a cooking education series.

“Down in the South we like to do things with a lot of fat and salt, so really being cognizant of that and teaching them to use other things to make food taste good,” such as herbs, will be a priority, Williams said. “It’s definitely a mindset. You have to change how people view it.”

The health center also plans to develop food boxes, working with a local food bank to get protein sources for patients and with a produce distributor to get fruits and vegetables.

But throughout it all, the community garden remains a fixture.

“You don’t even think you’re making that big a difference in the community,” Williams said. But feedback from patients – and enthusiasm for what the garden produces – have changed her mind.

“We’re teaching kids that, from the very beginning, they can be self-reliant,” she said.

Going back to the beginning

Between the pandemic and the winter storms that blanketed large swathes of the U.S. in February, need is especially high among Delta Health Center’s patients, said Neuaviska Stidhum, the health center’s chief operating officer and chief nursing officer.

“Right now, we’re in crisis,” she said. “We really want to be able to just get the hunger out, to provide for them so they won’t have that hunger.”

Since the 1960s, Delta Health Center has played a role in alleviating hunger among its patients. The health center currently has six acres of land – cultivated by a local university – that it uses to provide a range of fresh produce, from greens and sweet potatoes to fresh fruits.

Stidhum explained that, while many of their patients qualify for public assistance, it’s often not enough, or too far away to be accessible for people who don’t have transportation.

“It’s really difficult for some of our more rural patients…especially if they don’t have transportation and have to depend on someone else,” Boyles said.

The grant will be used to provide much-needed food vouchers to patients, and health providers will give patients supplemental information about how to choose and eat healthy food that won’t break the bank.

Stidhum has hopes for a kitchen in the health center someday. For the time being, providers will refer patients to cooking videos, health services, and other resources.

“We’re just going back to the beginning, to help the people any way we can,” she said.","In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average.
A 2019 study from the USDA’s Economic Research Service found that the state had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country – 15.7% of the population experienced it.
And the state’s community health centers are coming together to do something about it – together with the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi and Direct Relief.
Direct Relief provided the health center association with a $250,000 grant designed to fight hunger among Mississippi’s most vulnerable.
“Until we started asking the questions, I had no idea how pervasive [food insecurity] is down here,” she said."

15,15,"Jun 10, 2020",Civil Eats,"‘Fertile Ground’ Explores How Jackson, Mississippi, Is Charting a Better Food Future","Obesity. Poverty. Food Insecurity.

Mississippi has the dubious distinction of ranking high nationally in each of these interlinked categories. With the exception of New Mexico, the Magnolia State is the most food insecure place in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents. The film, directed by Alex Warren, with executive producer Robby Piantanida, airs tonight at 7 p.m. Central Time on Mississippi PBS and is also available online at PBS.org.

“There is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement about the film. “In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people.”

Fertile Ground, which was funded in part by a grant from the Bloomberg Foundation, shows how historic redlining—a practice in which banks prevented people of color from buying mortgages in white neighborhoods—resulted in the mostly Black and impoverished neighborhood of South Jackson having few grocery stores but several convenience stores with low-quality food. The city’s car culture and lack of sidewalks and bicycle lanes add to the problem, making it a herculean task for residents without vehicles to obtain nutrient-rich food. And children in Jackson’s most economically disadvantaged areas rely on school cafeterias to get balanced meals. In Mississippi, 1 in 4 children experiences hunger, compared to 1 in 5 adults.

In the wake of these challenges, urban farms, city planning projects, farm-to-table restaurants, and efforts to provide residents with locally grown food offer hope that food equality in Jackson is possible. Fertile Ground isn’t just a film, but an initiative that aims to shape policy and public dialogue about food access and nutrition through art, workshops, panel discussions, and other events.

Civil Eats spoke with Jackson chef Enrika Williams, a Fertile Ground workshop facilitator, and Travis Crabtree, a Jackson-based urban designer and Fertile Ground project manager, about the new documentary, redlining, urban farming, and the food inequities their city faces.

How does the layout of Jackson contribute to food inequality?

Travis Crabtree. Travis Crabtree.

Travis Crabtree: Whenever you have a city that is extremely car oriented, obviously you have accessibility issues, especially when you have neighborhoods that don’t have good public transportation, low car ownership, and no sidewalks—which is the reality for a lot of Jackson. Jackson started being built from the core, which is downtown Jackson, and then over time, you had white flight and people started to leave the city. That’s when all the grocery stores left.

It’s a very typical pattern in American cities. It has happened all over the country, but Jackson is a place that’s already dealing with extreme poverty, racial tensions, and [less] access to resources. When it comes to food insecurity, it’s super exacerbated here.

The documentary discusses how poverty in some Jackson neighborhoods played a role in supermarkets leaving. Why do you think that is?

Enrika Williams. Enrika Williams.

Enrika Williams: You can find plenty of convenience stores that have decided to take EBT because people in the community who are using food assistance need a place to spend their money so they can eat. But the larger grocery store chains are in the business of making money, and capitalists are not empathetic to anything but . . . making money. So, if the majority of the people who come into your stores are on some sort of public assistance, you look at the bottom line and think, “I’m not making any money.”

I also think there’s a stigma attached to public assistance recipients. Stores don’t want to appear to be accommodating to a demographic of EBT recipients. There’s also an insurance standpoint: It costs more to put your grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. It’s like another form of redlining.

How does the history of redlining play a role in the city’s present-day food landscape?

Crabtree: It’s really clear what lines divide Jackson—the train yard, the interstate, and these other sorts of urban barriers, even institutions like colleges or hospitals. They act as really large barriers that are disconnecting the white neighborhoods from Black neighborhoods. And generally the white neighborhoods are the ones that have the grocery stores and are more affluent.

Redlining obviously exists in most American cities, but it’s so apparent here. One thing that we’ve done outside of the documentary is we have a major public art component. We’ve tried to position our public art installations at the intersections of the redlines to bring the two communities together. We’re putting them right up against the railroad tracks and the different sort of segregation points to try to have conversations about what an integrated Jackson would be like.","The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents.

16,16,"Jun 9, 2020",CNN,Groceries were hard to find for millions. Now it's getting even worse,"New York (CNN Business) The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and limited delivery slots for online groceries.

But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

In 2015, an estimated 39 million people, or 12.8% of the US population, lived in ""low income and low access areas,"" according to the USDA's most recent data

The areas are defined as those where a ""significant"" portion of the population lives more than a mile from the nearest supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles away in rural areas. The poverty rate is either 20% or greater, or the median-family income is below or equal to 80% of the statewide median family income.

Such areas are commonly known as food deserts, even though the term has no official meaning. it's increasingly difficult for the people who live in them to buy food.

During the pandemic, grocers have cut back their operating hours. Public transportation has been reduced, and riders who once traveled to stores in other neighborhoods or cities can no longer do so. Some older or higher-risk populations are fearful of traveling during the pandemic.

There's also evidence that food accessibility challenges are growing. In Georgia, the number of residents now living in ""food insecure"" areas has jumped 69% since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data firm Urban Footprint. The firm uses an index, including jobless claims, pre-existing health conditions, and access to grocery stores and healthy food, to measure food security — or ""reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritionally adequate food.""

In Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky the number of residents living in food insecure areas has spiked 43%, 36% and 118% respectively, driven by the rise in unemployment, according to the analysis

The pandemic has made it ""very cumbersome"" to buy groceries, said Yolanda Jackson, who lives 1.6 miles from her nearest grocery store in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2018, 23.5% of Baltimore residents lived in an area where access to healthy food is limited.

Jackson usually takes the bus to Shoppers grocery store, but stopped during the pandemic in part because of the long waits. She has been going to corner stores and bodegas ""where the selections are low and the prices are high,"" she said.

Online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who rely on food stamps.

s minorities. The problem of food access disproportionately affectminorities. Research from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that lower-income minority neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores compared with similar white neighborhoods.

""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data.

'Online grocery shopping is not equal'

Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce, public health experts say.

Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.

""With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than processed items,"" said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes.

During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online.

Amazon AMZN Walmart WMT In states that do allow recipients to use their benefits online, their options are usually onlyor, which have gaps in where they deliver groceries to customers' home. And some deliveries have minimum purchase requirements or added shipping fees, which can be a barrier for low-income customers.

""Access to online grocery shopping is not equal,"" said Caitlin Caspi, assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Rep. Sanford Bishop, chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Subcommittee, wrote to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue last week urging the department to expand the number of grocers eligible to participate in the online program. ""Of the approved retailers, only two are national chains and only one of the national retailers can reach our most rural communities,"" Bishop said.

As food access challenges swell during the pandemic, cities, food banks, schools and community organizations are trying to find creative solutions.

""The public school system and many charter and private schools are continuing to offer meals to children and some of our urban farmers and chefs are teaming up to make meals for people in their neighborhoods who are in need of food,"" said Winona Bynum from the Detroit Food Policy Council.

In Baltimore, the city has developed an emergency response strategy. It's working to expand residents' participation in the food stamp program, which allows for online purchasing in the state of Maryland. The city has also ramped up delivering boxes of shelf-stable groceries and produce to residents' homes.","But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

About 13% of Americans, or 27.4 million people, reported they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat on a weekly basis, according to the latest Household Pulse Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 16. About 14 million households with children report not having enough to eat.

It's a situation lawmakers hope to improve. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a hunger crisis that has touched every part of our nation,"" Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry said in a statement Sunday. ""I am relieved that help is on the way and I look forward to continuing to do more in the new year to help Americans through this continuing crisis.""

Sunday's funding deal includes a 15% increase to the maximum SNAP benefits for six months through June 30, 2021, a move that many advocates were calling for. The increase amounts to a boost of about $25 per person each month.

The average SNAP benefit per person was $125 per month during the fiscal year 2020, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's about $1.39 per person per meal.

Roughly 6 to 7 million more people have applied and been approved for SNAP benefits since February, according to available data analyzed by CBPP. Nationally, that's about a 17% increase. About 25.3 million Americans total reported currently receiving SNAP benefits in the latest Census Household Pulse survey.

The latest relief package also expands SNAP eligibility to college students and excludes unemployment benefits from being counted as income when it comes to SNAP benefits. Additionally, U.S. territories including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa — which are not eligible for SNAP — will receive $614 million for nutrition grants.

The bill will also expand food access for children, including allowing any child under 6 to be deemed ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits under the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program. The program provides families with a voucher to purchase groceries to replace the breakfasts and lunches their children miss when schools and child-care centers are closed or only offering remote learning.

Congress reauthorized the program on Oct. 1, but it took the U.S. Department of Agriculture six weeks to establish the new guidelines for the program, meaning that states only started applying for funds this month.

Under the latest bipartisan deal, food banks also will receive $400 million in funding through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, will receive $175 million.

""Our network of member food banks across the country are witnessing unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for charitable food assistance,"" Kate Leone, Feeding America's chief government relations officer, said in a statement last week. ""Families are making impossible decisions between paying the rent and putting food on the table while food banks are working tirelessly to keep up with the increased need.""

The $13 billion in funding would provide ""limited but immediate help,"" Leone said, adding that more federal funding and assistance would likely be needed in the future. ""As always, and especially during this crisis, the simple truth is that charity alone cannot solve food insecurity.""

Read Stateline coverage of the latest state action on coronavirus.

Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify the California Department of Food and Agriculture's role in the Farm to Family program.

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a longstanding initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and supported by the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

“All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,” said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. “When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.”

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts Quick View Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts A U.S.-China trade deal is falling short on its commitments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don’t have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic’s early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

“If food banks can’t take more product [from the California program], farmers are going to go out of business,” Linkhart said. “That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.”

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

“That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,” said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. “It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.”

Raudabaugh said the state’s dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers’ distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don’t make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

“We’re providing many hundreds of percents more [to food banks] than pre-pandemic,” Raudabaugh said. “Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these [partnerships]. It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.”

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

“The money has to be there to justify the harvest,” Michael said, “and this solves some of that problem.”

Washington’s Work

On Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen’s small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers’ pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

“It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,” Van Laanen said. “It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.”

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he’s already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi’s Farm stay afloat.

“It was really timely,” Chichester said. “It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early timeframe.”

Karen Affeld, the development group’s executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

“Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,” she said. “That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.”

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state’s Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California’s that launched in 2014.

It’s a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they’re harvesting crops bound for food banks.

“Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,” said David Bobanick, the group’s executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another four pounds are donated by farmers.

“Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,” he said. “It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.”

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

“Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,” said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets’ food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she’s heard from parents who couldn’t otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

Making Connections

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture — known as CSA — in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program’s website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

“You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,” said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. “People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.”

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

“We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,” Lebeaux said. “Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.”

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

“We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,” said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. “One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.”

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

“If there’s one silver lining,” she said, “it’s that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.”","And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

JACKSON, Miss. — Mississippi is considering new rules that let companies continue to use food-labeling terms such as “veggie burger” and “vegan bacon,” as long as the terms are prominently displayed so consumers understand the products are not meat.

The state agriculture department on Thursday proposed new regulations for plant-based products that are sold as alternatives to meat.

The regulations were published weeks after a nonprofit organization that advocates plant-based foods and an Illinois food company sued Mississippi over a labeling law. The suit was filed on July 1, the same day the state enacted the law saying that “a plant-based or insect-based food product shall not be labeled as meat or a meat food product.”

................................................................

Meat producers have been trying to protect meat terminology by pushing for state laws that restrict labeling of products such as meatless meatballs.

Makers of plant-based foods have also sued Missouri and Arkansas over labeling laws.

The proposed Mississippi regulations say terms such as “plant-based” must be clearly displayed on packaging of products such as vegetarian hot dogs. The rules will be open for public comment for nearly a month. Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson told The Associated Press on Friday that if there are no changes needed after the comment period, he will issue an order for the regulations to take effect.

“They’re commonsense rules,” Gipson said. “We’re doing exactly what we intended to do.”

Gipson said the regulations do not weaken the food labeling law, and he said terms like “veggie burger” were never going to be illegal. He said while many products are already clearly labeled, the law is aimed at those that are designed to deceive consumers.

“That whole lawsuit has been a waste of time,” Gipson said. Speaking of groups that filed it, Gipson said: “They’re just trying to raise money.”

The lawsuit was filed by Plant Based Foods Association and Illinois-based Upton’s Naturals Co., which makes vegan products and sells them in many states. Both are represented in the suit by the Mississippi Justice Institute and the Virginia-based Institute for Justice.

The lawsuit is still active, but the two groups issued statements Friday saying the proposed regulations are a victory for the First Amendment.

“It shouldn’t be a crime for plant-based food companies to describe their products in a way that everyone understands,” Mississippi Justice Institute director Aaron Rice said.

Institute of Justice attorney Justin Pearson said: “Our lawsuit made it clear that subjecting plant-based food companies to possible criminal prosecution for using common terms on their labels would be a violation of their free speech rights.”

Spokesmen for both groups said the lawsuit could be dropped if the regulations take effect as currently written.

The Mississippi law also says “cultured animal tissue” made in a lab from animal cells may not be labeled as meat or a meat product.

21,21,"Jun 21, 2018",CNBC,House narrowly approves farm bill that could cut food stamps to millions of low-income Americans,"The House narrowly approved an $867 billion farm bill with controversial provisions that could stop millions from receiving food stamps and toughen work requirements for program participants.

The House's 213-211 vote means the legislation will go to conference with the Senate version of the bill. This marked the second attempt by the House to pass the farm bill after it failed to approve the legislation last month, due to an immigration squabble among Republicans.

There are nutritional program cuts in the House farm bill that could face problems in conference with the Senate version. The Senate Agriculture Committee's farm bill passed out of the panel June 13 and didn't include major changes in food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

""This bill does nothing to actually strengthen agriculture programs or help farmers caught in the president's trade war,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass, in a release. ""I hope the bipartisan process in the Senate leads to a better bill that strengthens our farm safety net and anti-hunger programs so this attack on our most vulnerable never reaches the president's desk.""

But the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture hailed at passage of the 2018 farm bill.

""Today's vote was about keeping faith with the men and women of rural America and about the enduring promise of the dignity of a day's work,"" Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, said in a statement. ""It was about providing certainty to farmers and ranchers who have been struggling under the weight of a five-year recession and about providing our neighbors in need with more than just a hand out, but a hand up.""

The House farm bill includes cuts of more than $20 billion in SNAP benefits over 10 years. The legislation also contains provisions that could see more than 2 million low-income Americans lose their benefits or experience declines in financial assistance. Critics of the legislation also contend the legislation could result in nearly 265,000 children losing access to free school meals.

Total benefits paid out last year by SNAP exceeded $63 billion, and went to more than 42 million participants.

The House's farm bill — formally known as the so-called Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 — includes new work requirements for SNAP participants that tighten existing rules. The White House also has been pushing for tougher work requirements for public assistance programs that target low-income Americans, including food stamps and public housing assistance.

""They're trying to find ways to cut back on people who have access to SNAP, and frankly they're trying to do it by putting in new work requirements"" said Steve Taylor, senior vice president and counsel for public policy with United Way Worldwide, a global nonprofit based in Virginia. ""United Way agrees in the value and dignity of work. We want people to be able to be able to work and pull themselves out of even needing services and needing things like food stamps.""

Taylor said there was United Way staff from all around the country on Capitol Hill on Thursday ahead of the farm bill vote in the House.

""What we found was there were a lot of congressional offices voting on this bill that didn't know that SNAP already has work requirements,"" he said. ""So I think there may be some misunderstanding about exactly what the requirements are in SNAP, which is unfortunate when you're vote on a bill that is just creating obstacles for needy people.""

However, some Republican members of Congress applauded the SNAP changes in the bill.

""I am especially supportive of the reforms made to SNAP, which require able-bodied individuals aged 18-59 to participate in employment training or work a minimum of 20 hours a week,"" said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., in a statement. ""By refocusing reforms on work requirement, those who depend on SNAP, like the elderly and disabled, still have access to the support they need, but significant steps are taken to ensure that Americans are entering the workforce and no longer dependent on federal government assistance.""

The farm bill also contains changes that have angered environmentalists who claim the new rules would undermine clean water rules and exempt pesticide pollution.

The farm bill covers everything from farm subsidies and food stamps to trade and rural development policy. Farmer assistance includes commodity payment programs, as well as subsidized crop insurance. The bill is usually renewed every five years, and the current version is set to expire Sept. 30.

""Passage of a long-term Farm Bill allows farmers and ranchers to plan ahead and make decisions to improve their business,"" said Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., in a release. He represents a congressional district in California's Central Valley, a region known for its extensive agriculture production.



""Passage of the House farm bill today is a big win for America's farmers and ranchers,"" American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. ""Our grassroots Farm Bureau members clearly made their voices heard. By approving the 2018 Farm Bill today, members of the House recognized the serious economic challenges facing farmers and ranchers across the country.""

Duvall said the farm organization will now turn its attention to the Senate version of the farm bill and work with Senate Agriculture Committee leaders. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated he wants to get the farm bill through the upper chamber before the July Fourth recess.

""The Senate bill also addresses the challenges our farmers and ranchers are facing today,"" said Duvall. ""We will also continue to focus our attention on other areas important to farmers, such as finding a solution for the very serious ag labor shortage, increasing market opportunities through trade and cutting the burdens of regulations that have piled up during previous administrations.""

The Sierra Club issued a press release after the farm bill's passage slamming what it called ""a package that weakens the SNAP anti-hunger program and includes provisions undermining bedrock environmental safeguards for clean water, wildfire and forests.""

Specifically, environmentalists say farm bill includes rollbacks on the Clean Water Act requirements as it relates to pesticides by easing rules on permits. They also called out provisions in the legislation that would speed up logging and mining in forests.","The House narrowly approved an $867 billion farm bill with controversial provisions that could stop millions from receiving food stamps and toughen work requirements for program participants.

22,22,"Jul 9, 2019",ProCon.org,Mississippi Bans Meat-Related Names for Vegetarian Product Labels,"Source: miikkahoo, “Veggie Burger with Zucchini/Feta/Pea Patty,” wikimedia.org, June 13, 2018 A new law in Mississippi (SB 2922) bans the use of certain descriptive words traditionally associated with meat products on labels for vegetarian and vegan plant-based products. As of July 1, 2019, words such as “burger” and “hot dog” can only be used if the product is made of animal meat. That means the name “veggie burger” is no longer permitted on labels for plant-based patties. The ban also applies to food made from insects and meats made in a lab from cultured animal cells (as opposed to slaughtered livestock). Andy Berry, Mississippi Cattlemen’s Association Executive Vice President, stated last year, “We’re concerned about how those products are labeled… People have a choice, and we don’t want them to be mislead or maybe even tricked into buying something that is ‘meat’ that has no meat in it.” The new law is meant to protect consumers from confusion and manufacturers from unfair competition with plant-based products, according to proponents. The ban is being challenged in court by the Institute for Justice and the Plant Based Foods Association, among other groups. Missouri passed a similar law in 2018, which is also being challenged in court as a First Amendment violation by groups including the Good Food Institute and the ACLU. Jessica Almy, Director of Policy at the Good Food Institute, said, “There is no evidence that consumers are confused by plant-based bacon or veggie burger labels, and federal laws are already in place that prohibits consumer deception. This law is a tremendous overstep of state powers.” Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson defended the law, saying, “It’s not a free speech violation to require the truth in consumer products. And to claim that something is meat that isn’t meat is not true.” A US District Court in California previously ruled that consumers were not being tricked into mistaking plant-based products for animal-based products in a 2013 case regarding the use of the word “milk.” The ruling stated, “The crux of the claims is that a reasonable consumer might confuse plant-based beverages such as soymilk or almond milk for dairy milk, because of the use of the word ‘milk.’ The Court finds such confusion highly improbable because of the use of the words ‘soy’ and ‘almond.’ Plaintiffs essentially allege that a reasonable consumer would view the terms ‘soymilk’ and ‘almond milk,’ disregard the first words in the names, and assume that the beverages came from cows. The claim stretches the bounds of credulity.” Vegan and vegetarian products have come under labeling scrutiny in other places as well. In Canada, Blue Heron Creamery can no longer use the word “cheese” for their plant-based dairy-free products as of Feb. 2019. Words like Cheddar and chèvre are also prohibited. A German court ruled similarly against cheese-substitute manufacturer TofuTown in 2016. In the European Union, “veggie burgers” may soon be called “veggie discs” following the European parliament’s agriculture committee approval of a ban on using meat-related terminology on vegetarian food. Sales of plant-based “meats” increased 42% from 2016 to 2019; the market for these products is worth an estimated $12.1 billion in 2019 and could reach $27.9 billion by 2025. Beyond Meat, a plant-based food manufacturer, almost doubled its net revenue from $32.6 million in 2017 to $87.9 million in 2018. Fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Del Taco now offer plant-based “fake meat” substitutes in some locations.","Source: miikkahoo, “Veggie Burger with Zucchini/Feta/Pea Patty,” wikimedia.org, June 13, 2018 A new law in Mississippi (SB 2922) bans the use of certain descriptive words traditionally associated with meat products on labels for vegetarian and vegan plant-based products.

23,23,"Dec 7, 2020",Associated Press,Millions of hungry Americans turn to food banks for 1st time,"Millions of hungry Americans turn to food banks for 1st time

The deadly pandemic that tore through the nation’s heartland struck just as Aaron Crawford was in a moment of crisis. He was looking for work, his wife needed surgery, then the virus began eating away at her work hours and her paycheck.

The Crawfords had no savings, mounting bills and a growing dread: What if they ran out of food? The couple had two boys, 5 and 10, and boxes of macaroni and cheese from the dollar store could go only so far.

A 37-year-old Navy vet, Crawford saw himself as self-reliant. Asking for food made him uncomfortable. “I felt like I was a failure,” he says. “It’s this whole stigma ... this mindset that you’re this guy who can’t provide for his family, that you’re a deadbeat.”

Hunger is a harsh reality in the richest country in the world. Even during times of prosperity, schools hand out millions of hot meals a day to children, and desperate elderly Americans are sometimes forced to choose between medicine and food.

Now, in the pandemic of 2020, with illness, job loss and business closures, millions more Americans are worried about empty refrigerators and barren cupboards. Food banks are doling out meals at a rapid pace and an Associated Press data analysis found a sharp rise in the amount of food distributed compared with last year. Meanwhile, some folks are skipping meals so their children can eat and others are depending on cheap food that lacks nutrition.

Those fighting hunger say they’ve never seen anything like this in America, even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The first place many Americans are finding relief is a neighborhood food pantry, most connected to vast networks of nonprofits. Tons of food move each day from grocery store discards and government handouts to warehouse distribution centers, and then to the neighborhood charity.

The Crawfords turned to the Family Resource Centers and Food Shelf, part of 360 Communities, a nonprofit 15 minutes from their apartment in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When needed, they receive monthly boxes of fresh produce, dairy, deli, meat and other basics — enough food to fill two grocery carts. If that runs out, they can get an emergency package to tide them over for the rest of the month.

Crawford’s wife, Sheyla, had insisted they seek help; her hours had been cut at the day care center where she worked. At first, Crawford was embarrassed to go the food shelf; he worried he’d bump into someone he knew. He now sees it differently.

“It didn’t make me a bad man or a terrible husband or father,” he says. “On the contrary, I was actually doing something to make sure that my wife and kids had something thing to eat.”

The history books are filled with iconic images of America’s struggles against hunger. Among the most memorable are the Depression-era photos of men standing in breadlines, huddled in long coats and fedoras, their eyes large with fear. An overhead sign reads: “Free Soup. Coffee and a Doughnut for the Unemployed.”

This year’s portrait of hunger has a distinctively bird’s eye view: Enormous traffic jams captured from drone-carrying cameras. Cars inching along, each driver waiting hours for a box or bag of food. From Anaheim, California to San Antonio, Texas to Toledo, Ohio and Orlando, Florida and points in-between, thousands of vehicles carrying hungry people queued up for miles across the horizon. In New York, and other large cities, people stand, waiting for blocks on end.

The newly hungry have similar stories: Their industry collapsed, they lost a job, their hours were cut, an opportunity fell through because of illness.

Handwritten “closed” signs appeared on the windows of stores and restaurants soon after the pandemic arrived. Paychecks shrank or disappeared altogether as unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7 percent, a rate not seen in almost a century.

Food banks felt the pressure almost immediately.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, scrambled to keep up as states locked down and schools — many providing free breakfasts and lunches — closed. In late March, 20 percent of the organization’s 200 food banks were in danger of running out of food.

The problem with supply subsided, but demand has not. Feeding America has never handed out so much food so fast — 4.2 billion meals from March through October. The organization has seen a 60 percent average increase in food bank users during the pandemic: about 4 in 10 are first-timers.

An AP analysis of Feeding America data from 181 food banks in its network found the organization has distributed nearly 57 percent more food in the third quarter of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

There will be no quick decline as the pandemic rages on, having already claimed more than 280,000 lives and infecting 14.7 million people across the nation.

Feeding America estimates those facing hunger will swell to 1 in 6 people, from 35 million in 2019 to more than 50 million by this year’s end. The consequences are even more dire for children — 1 in 4, according to the group.

Some states have been hit especially hard: Nevada, a tourist mecca whose hotel, casino and restaurant industries were battered by the pandemic, is projected to vault from 20th place in 2018 to 5th place this year in food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America.

In four states — Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana — more than 1 in 5 residents are expected to be food insecure by year’s end, meaning they won’t have money or resources to put food on the table, the report said.

In New Orleans one recent Saturday morning, Donna Duerr was waiting to pick up food in a drive-through donation — something that has become part of her routine since COVID-19 swept in last spring.

Her husband was laid off from his job as a pipefitter and she’s unable to work, having undergone two surgeries — one on her spine, the other on her arm — in the last two months. She also has two grown children who’ve moved home since the pandemic began.

“This is a hard thing to accept that you have to do this,” says a weary-sounding Duerr, her throat covered with bandages as the result of a recent operation. Every morning she monitors the local news for announcements of the next food donation; she tries to attend as many as she can, sometimes sharing the food with less-mobile neighbors.

Duerr, 56, faces painful choices. “I either pay bills or get food,” she says, though these donations have brought some relief.

Norman Butler is another first-timer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he and his girlfriend, Cheryl, arrived at 3 a.m. at a drive-through food bank in a suburban New Orleans sports stadium. They joined a pre-dawn procession of mothers with their kids, the elderly and folks like him — unemployed workers.

“You can see the look of uncertainty on their faces,” he says. “Everybody’s just worried about their next meal.”

Before the pandemic, Butler, 53, flourished in the tourism-dominated city, working as an airport shuttle and limousine driver, a valet and hotel doorman. Since March, when the bustling streets turned silent, jobs in the city have been scarce.

“A lot of people are in limbo,” he says. “The main thing we need is to get back to work.”

Low-wage employees, many in the service industry, have borne the brunt of economic hardship. But the misery has reached deeper into the workforce.

A September report commissioned by the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, found 1 in 4 of those reporting they didn’t have enough to eat typically had incomes above $50,000 a year before the outbreak.

In Anchorage, Alaska, Brian and Airis Messick were coasting along in full-time jobs for companies that support the state’s oil industry. They were moving toward buying a house.

When March arrived, everything unraveled.

Brian, 28, the newest hire at an electrical wiring company, was laid off. Within a week, Airis, an office worker at an oil well testing firm, lost her job, too.

Then it became a monthly game of deciding who gets paid first with their unemployment checks — the landlord or one of the many bills. They kept their car filled with gas in case they had to move.

The Messicks and their 9-year-old son, Jayden, tried to survive on $50 to $75 a week because, she says, “that’s all we could squeeze.” They turned to a food bank for only the second time — they’d sought help after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.

After that devastation, the Messicks, who’d met in Florida, decided to get a fresh start and move to Alaska, where Airis had grown up.

Airis, who just turned 30, found work in August, ironically, at the state unemployment office. “I hear people’s stories all day,” she says. “I listen to moms cry about not having money to take care of their kids. My heart aches for the people who get denied.”

Brian stays home with Jayden, who is autistic, helping him with school and driving him to appointments. Also part of the family are Cleo, a pit bull-lab mix, and Daisy, a bearded dragon.

Airis earns too much for the family to receive state financial aid. Anchorage’s high cost-of-living, partly fueled by the expense of shipping goods to the nation’s most northern state, makes it harder to economize even with coupons and careful shopping.

She says the family will continue to go to the food bank until the economy improves, which she expects won’t be soon.

There should be better systems in place, she says, to help families.

“I feel great knowing that we’re not alone, that we’re, you know, not out here being the only one suffering but,” she says, “it makes me mad to know my government failed us.”

For communities of color, the pandemic has been a compound disaster with Blacks and Latinos reeling from disproportionately high rates of deaths, infections — and joblessness.

Unemployment surged among Latinos to 18.9 percent this spring, higher than any other racial and ethnic group, according to federal statistics. Though it has since fallen, many are still struggling.

More than 1 in 5 Black and Latino adults with children said as of July 2020 they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat, according to the commissioned report. That was double the rate of white and Asian households. It also found that women, households with children and people of color are at greatest risk of hunger.

Abigail Leocadio, 34, first approached the nonprofit Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, Arizona, during hard times about a decade ago. Her family rebounded and she completed training to become a phlebotomist, landing a job drawing blood specimens for a local lab.

Leocadio was just 7 when her family brought her to the U.S. from their native Cuernavaca, Mexico. She currently is protected from deportation and has a work permit through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

When her husband, a restaurant cook, was laid off earlier in the pandemic, her income — barely more than the $11 state minimum wage — wasn’t enough to cover their expenses.

Though they own a two-bedroom trailer, they pay $500 a month to rent the lot. Add to that as much as $450 in monthly electric bills and internet service so their four kids, 9 to 15, can attend class remotely. Before schools closed, the kids received free breakfasts and lunches on campus.

“It has been hard feeding all the kiddos daily,” Leocadio said outside the trailer after a recent delivery from the charity of two boxes including canned tomatoes, dried beans, rice, breakfast cereal and the kids’ undisputed favorite: specialty Oreo cookies.

The food, she says, provides less than half of what her family eats in four weeks, but significantly reduces their monthly bill to about $250. Before the pandemic, the family was saving to buy a house, but that money has been wiped out. Her husband, though, is back at work.

“We always figure out things one way or another,” Leocadio says, though she’s worried about the surge in coronavirus cases and what lies ahead. “We really don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Briana Dominguez had been depending on food pantries in the Chicago area since last fall to supplement her groceries. With two sons, ages 3 and 14, it was hard to keep up, even though she and her boyfriend both worked full-time.

“I never thought it would be me,” she says of her visits to the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois. “But you do what you gotta do to survive.”

A series of misfortunes brought them to a turning point.

Dominguez had a miscarriage, and her father lost his job, due to the pandemic. So did her boyfriend, a trucker. In November her company, which sells ceiling tiles for hospitals and other business, eliminated her job with little notice.

Dominguez, 34, who has a small severance, has decided to move to Georgia, where she has family and living costs are lower. Her boyfriend has found work as a customer service representative that he can do from anywhere, though it’s only $13 an hour. She traveled there in early December to scout job possibilities.

“If I don’t do it now,” she says, “I’ll never do it.”

While food banks have become critical during the pandemic, they’re just one path for combating hunger. For every meal from a food bank, a federal program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, provides nine.

Anti-hunger groups have lobbied Congress for a 15 percent increase in maximum food stamp benefits, A similar measure went a long way in digging the nation out of the Great Recession. A stimulus bill passed by the House this spring includes such a provision, but it has been bogged down in partisan squabbling.

“Food banks and food pantries are doing great work,” says Luis Guardia, president of thee Food Research & Action Center. “But they simply cannot do enough to be something of the order of magnitude that we’re seeing right now. ”

Many going to food pantries also are receiving food stamps, though eligibility varies among states.

Aaron Crawford says the addition of $550 in food stamps the family started receiving last summer has made a significant difference in their lives.

Others have discovered they couldn’t make it without food help, even with Social Security or other benefits.

(AP Video/Martha Irvine)

Phyllis Marder, 66, had both Social Security and unemployment when she arrived at the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois, where she’s lived in the same bungalow for 20 years.

She’d been supplementing her benefits as an Uber drive, and when the pandemic hit, she helped workers bring home their computers and office gear. After that, she ferried medical and other front-line workers, but that came to an abrupt end with a COVID-19 scare.

At first, Marder, didn’t tell anyone about visiting food pantries. Then she had a change of heart. “Keeping a secret makes things get worse,” she says, “… and makes me feel worse about myself, and so I decided that it was more important to talk about it.”

Marder sometimes shared her food with neighbors and a panhandler on a freeway ramp. But she expects her food bank visits will end soon.

In a few days, she starts a job — courtesy of the pandemic.

She’ll be a coronavirus contract tracer, working remotely for a nearby county.

___

As the year nears its end, Crawford is more confident.

The months have been filled with setbacks and successes. Both Crawfords developed mild cases of COVID-19. Sheyla had hysterectomy surgery and was out work without pay for six weeks.

But they’ve rebounded, too.

Crawford has two part-time jobs, one at United Parcel Service, the second as a maintenance worker at a home for the elderly. His wife is back at work at the day care center. And their boys are receiving breakfast and lunch at their school that provides day care.

The financial troubles that brought them to the food bank haven’t disappeared. They still have overdue bills and a car that needs repairs.

But after many dark months, there have been moments of relief. This fall when the couple contracted COVID-19, their sons’ school sent meals and milk to help,

And a friend had an 18-pound turkey delivered for a Thanksgiving feast. It was so big the Crawfords had to figure out how to find room for the leftovers in the refrigerator now stocked with food.

A full fridge, Crawford says, is a welcome sight.

“It just kind of puts you at ease,” he says. “There’s a sense of peace.”

25,25,"May 4, 2018",Mississippi Today,Mississippi still the hungriest state,"For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

“We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.

27,27,"Mar 12, 2020",Civil Eats,Congress Addresses Food Insecurity in Its Legislative Response to COVID-19,"Editor’s note: This is a developing story; Civil Eats will update as the news evolves.

March 27, 2020 update: The U.S. House of Representative overwhelmingly passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus recovery and stimulus bill today, sending it to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it.

March 26, 2020 update: The Senate’s stimulus bill includes nearly $16 billion for SNAP, but not the additional 15 percent boost that Democrats were seeking. Also included in the bill is a $9.5 billion emergency fund for producers of specialty crops and support for local food systems, including farmers’ markets. In addition, the bill directs $285 million to USDA agencies to support emergency operations during the pandemic.

March 25, 2020 update: The Senate and White House early on Wednesday reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion spending bill aimed at supporting businesses, workers, and individuals during the pandemic. The bill text is not yet public, but once it is made public, the House of Representatives will review and vote on the bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats earlier this week offered their own version of a stimulus / support package.

March 18, 2020 update: The Senate on Wednesday afternoon voted 90-8 to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, aimed at providing some support and benefits to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

March 16, 2020 update: Early on Saturday, March 14, the House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with strong bipartisan support, and with many of the provisions described in the original article below included.

The final text includes language that gives USDA the ability to waive various requirements that are preventing districts from feeding hungry children while schools are shuttered. As of March 15, at least 64,000 schools have closed, affecting more than 32.5 million students.

On SNAP, the final bill prevents eligibility restrictions during a public health emergency and gives states some flexibility to ask for emergency allotments, but does not directly increase benefits. It also provides an additional $500 million in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and an additional $250 million for food programs for low-income seniors, through September 2021.

The Senate is expected to take up the bill today. While some Republicans and President Trump have signaled support, its fate is still uncertain.

March 13, 2020, 3pm ET update:In a press conference at 2:00pm ET, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be “passing a bill” today. “Our bill takes aggressive action to strengthen food security initiatives including student meals as well as SNAP, senior meals, and food banks,” she said. However, Civil Eats has yet to see a final version of the legislative package, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. So it remains unclear which of the provisions on school meals and SNAP benefits (described below, as provisions of separate marker bills) will make it into the final legislation.

March 13, 2020, 11am ET update: As of early Friday, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate the package of legislation; a vote in the House of Representatives is expected today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned for the weekend on Thursday, but canceled the Senate’s scheduled recess next week, so a vote on the legislative package could happen next week if the House passes the bill.

At least 10,600 schools have closed across the U.S., affecting at least 4.9 million students. Five states have closed their schools entirely: Ohio, Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and Washington.

28,28,"Apr 9, 2020",The New York Times,‘Never Seen Anything Like It’: Cars Line Up for Miles at Food Banks,"Based in Las Vegas, Three Square Food Bank previously distributed food through 180 pantries across Clark County. Since the outbreak — and the sudden closing of nearly all of the city’s gambling and tourism attractions — the organization has restructured, with 10 pantries and 21 new drive-through distribution sites.

Larry Scott, Three Square’s chief operating officer, said that the group had expected 200 to 250 cars a day at each drive-through. They’re getting up to 500 to 600 cars instead, with lines up to four miles long. “Every day, we distribute everything that we bring to a site,” Mr. Scott said.

An initial glut of high-quality food from shuttered casinos is basically gone, Mr. Scott said. Now his food bank is burning through an extra $300,000 to $400,000 a week in cash to buy food.

He said that he saw no relief in sight. “What we do today has to be repeated again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day,” Mr. Scott said. “Hungry people are hungry each and every day.”

Ericka Smrcka, an official at Food Bank for the Heartland in Nebraska, went to a recent mobile food distribution at a middle school in neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. She and a colleague arrived nearly an hour before it was scheduled to start to find the streets jammed in every direction and the police directing traffic.

“We were overwhelmed with tears,” Ms. Smrcka said. “Oh, my gosh. Everywhere we looked, there were just cars.”

The delivery truck had enough boxes of food — produce, bread and milk — for 200 vehicles. Some 400 showed up. Ms. Smrcka recalled feeling apprehensive at the prospect of walking car to car with nothing more than a flier describing alternative resources, thinking she might get yelled at.

But that’s not what happened. “After sitting in their car for an hour and not receiving any food, they still said thank you,” she said, recalling in particular a father who had left work early and picked up his three daughters, and who departed empty-handed.","Based in Las Vegas, Three Square Food Bank previously distributed food through 180 pantries across Clark County.

29,29,"Jan 26, 2021",Civil Eats,The Pandemic Reveals Racial Gaps in School Meal Access,"As an attorney working on school desegregation cases in the South, GeDá Jones Herbert is intimately familiar with inequities and discrimination that Black families face on a regular basis. And when schools began shutting down in-person instruction last March due to the pandemic, she heard from many of her clients.

“We knew that [the pandemic] was going to have a huge impact on the lives of our clients and students across the country,” said Herbert, who is based in New Orleans and works primarily on cases in Louisiana and Alabama. “As we were assessing the closures, the things we were really looking at were access to distance learning . . . and food and nutrition.”

Her team at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) zeroed in specifically on the connection between meal access and race. The education lawyers knew many students from low-income families depended on school meals for adequate nutrition. In 2019, more than 29 million children ate free and reduced-price school lunches daily. In the communities LDF was working in, they also knew that a disproportionate number of those students were Black.

Once COVID-19 began its spread early last year, school nutrition departments across the country began scrambling to continue serving meals in various ways. After waivers from the federal government allowed them to make changes like packaging meals to go, some districts set up pick-up sites, and others used bus drivers to deliver meals. But many districts began going broke in the process, and others faced COVID outbreaks. In response, some districts limited pick-up site operation to just a few hours a week, and others stopped serving meals altogether.

Herbert and her team argued that several districts that ceased meal service were violating civil rights laws, because such a high proportion of students eating the subsidized meals were Black. Even in places where meals were offered, limitations like site location and pick-up times prevented many Black families from accessing them.

LDF sent letters to the governors of Louisiana and Alabama detailing their legal arguments and sharing what they were hearing from clients. “A child without access to transportation by car in the Four Corners neighborhood in St. Mary Parish [southwest of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico] would have had to walk four hours each way to get to the nearest ‘Grab n Go’ site, each of which was open for a mere hour and a half,” one letter read. “Even after the district eventually added a Baldwin site, children in the Four Corners neighborhood still would have had to walk two hours each way to pick up their breakfast and lunch.”

“A child without access to transportation by car in the Four Corners neighborhood in St. Mary Parish would have had to walk four hours each way to get to the nearest ‘Grab n Go’ site, each of which was open for a mere hour and a half.”

In Leeds, Alabama, schools stopped providing meals entirely on April 2. LDF sued the district there, forcing it to restart meal service. LDF’s efforts caught the attention of researchers at Columbia, Harvard, and the University of North Carolina. They began working on several projects that looked at whether access to school meals during the pandemic was affected by race.

The situation gained the attention of several members of Congress as well. In June, Representative Bobby Scott (D-Virginia), chairman of the Committee On Education and Labor, sent a letter to former Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “I am concerned that during this pandemic, many Black and other children of color are left hungry due to inadequate access to school meals,” he wrote, noting a dire statistic: During March and April, the rate of food insecurity for Black households was double that of white households.

Since then, districts across the country—including those LDF is monitoring—have gotten better at streamlining pandemic meal services, giving more students access to food. And schools are back in session in some areas. But racial discrepancies still exist.

In December, the Urban Institute reported 40 percent of Black families with school-age children were food insecure in September, compared to 15 percent of white families. Meanwhile, nearly two thirds of all families reported that their children were not receiving meals from schools. “These data suggest that a significant portion of vulnerable children may not be benefiting from school-based nutrition resources amid the shifting mix of virtual and hybrid instruction,” the report noted.

And while school meal access may not be as stark an issue as it was just months ago, Herbert and other experts say questions of how to guarantee equitable access to school meals—and whether the current system does enough to consider race—are more pressing than ever.

“Just because a system has been put in place and people are maintaining it for now doesn’t mean that the problem is solved,” she said. “This is going to continue to be an issue, so we really have to develop some longer-term solutions.”

Mapping Meal Sites

When schools shut down, researchers around the country who focus on school meal programs began sharing resources and chatting online about what they were seeing. Julia McCarthy is the interim deputy director of the Laurie M. Tisch Center for Food, Education & Policy at Columbia University. She formed a research team with Caroline Glagola Dunn at Harvard and Jared McGuirt at the University of North Carolina Greensboro to begin studying school meal access across the country.

When she saw LDF’s letter to the governor of Louisiana, McCarthy was shocked. To help document evidence of possible disparities in southern Louisiana districts, McCarthy, Dunn, and McGuirt used U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and district data to visually depict where meal pick-up sites were located in relation to the percentage of the neighborhood population that was Black.

“In the westernmost part of St. Mary Parish, the census block tract there is 72 to 88 percent Black. There wasn’t a single meal distribution site there.”

Based on those maps, “It was pretty consistent across the board that sites were more conveniently located for white families,” Herbert said. She anticipated that the problem would be exacerbated by the fact that based on the most recent data, 17 percent of Black residents in Louisiana don’t have access to a car, compared to 5 percent of white residents.

“In the westernmost part of St. Mary Parish, the census block tract there is 72 to 88 percent Black. There wasn’t a single meal distribution site there,” McCarthy said.

St. John Parish, about 30 miles northwest of New Orleans, is an area known for a history of environmental racism, with Black communities bearing the brunt of toxic air pollution from chemical plants and oil refineries. The parish has the highest risk of cancer due to air pollution in the entire country.","and food and nutrition.”Her team at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) zeroed in specifically on the connection between meal access and race.

31,31,"Nov 23, 2020",,"Survey: Food Insecurity, Lack of Support Remain Top Challenges for Mississippians Receiving SNAP","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic. A new state survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients finds that Mississippi families need help with food, housing and utilities, especially since government assistance for many families expired earlier this year.

The survey was released by the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP). It found that 66 percent of those surveyed were having trouble buying enough food at some point during the pandemic. Child care issues were cited by 32 percent and the loss of jobs were also cited by 29 percent.

“Food security was a challenge for many Mississippians well before the pandemic, whether it was people struggling to make ends meet in low wage work or who lacked access to fresh food where they lived,” said Sara Miller, policy analyst at the Hope Policy Institute. “As the pandemic brings these issues to a crisis point, families and communities need both near-term recovery efforts and improvements to food systems in our state overall.”

Government assistance has made a real difference, with 51 percent of respondents saying programs or assistance helped. But most of that aid has expired. Organizations like the SPLC Action Fund, Hope Policy Institute, Children’s Defense Fund, Hope Delta and Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Mississippi, Mississippi Center for Justice and the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative are calling for the state and federal government to take these concerns into account and move immediately to provide more assistance.

“What this survey shows is that people need help,” said Brandon Jones, Mississippi policy director for the SPLC Action Fund. “We need the government, both at the state and federal level, to do more to help the people who are suffering because of the pandemic.”

Of the 12 Southern states surveyed, Mississippi was the only state to have SNAP and P-EBT application issues as the greatest challenges. All other Southern states had problems with unemployment insurance or stimulus checks as the top challenge. The share of Mississippi respondents who had problems applying for or receiving SNAP was 10 percentage points higher than the share for all Southern respondents (23% vs. 13%).

“The pandemic has exacerbated poverty in Mississippi and the need for holistic systems of support is urgent,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative. “Mississippians need access to food, child care, housing and employment assistance to rebuild their economic security. Mississippians who received pandemic unemployment benefits were priced out of SNAP and consequently lost food assistance, a glaring example of our fractured safety net.”

The data came from 297 anonymized surveys in Mississippi in August and September. Respondents were invited to answer a mixture of multiple choice and open-ended questions about challenges and changes in the wake of the pandemic, experiences using and applying for government benefits, and recommendations and requests for policymakers.","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic.

32,32,"Sep 10, 2019",The National Law Review,Mississippi Reverses Stance on Plant-Based Meat Labeling,"Tuesday, September 10, 2019

As previously reported on this blog, Upton’s Naturals Co. and the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA) filed a lawsuit challenging Mississippi’s law prohibiting cell-based, plant-based, or insect-based foods from being labeled as “meat” or a “meat food product” (i.e., “hamburgers,” “hotdogs,” etc.). The lawsuit was filed on July 1, 2019, the same day that the law took effect. The plaintiffs claimed that the Mississippi law violated their First Amendment right to free speech, among other things. The Institute for Justice (IJ) later joined the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Last week, the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce proposed new regulations to implement the law that would allow the use of meat and meat product terms on the labels of plant-based food if certain conditions are met. More specifically, the proposed regulations specify that a plant-based food product will not be considered to be labeled as a “meat” or “meat food product” if one or more of the following terms, or a comparable qualifier, is prominently displayed on the front of the package: “meat free,” “meatless,” “plant-based,” “veggie-based,” “made from plants,” “vegetarian,” or “vegan.”

After the proposed regulations were revised, Ag Commissioner Andy Gipson issued a statement on September 6, stated that the law “is constitutional and has not changed.” He added, “Our proposed rules support the law and make it clear these products cannot be false or misleading and cannot be labeled as meat or as a meat food product, but must use the qualifiers set out in the regulations.” He also claimed that there “was no need for a federal lawsuit.”

Expressing an opposing view, IJ issued a press release stating that the recently proposed regulatory changes were in response to the lawsuit. “Our lawsuit made it clear that subjecting plant-based food companies to possible criminal prosecution for using common terms on their labels would be a violation of their free speech rights,” said IJ Senior Attorney Justin Pearson.

Upton’s Natural and PBFA will consider dropping their federal lawsuit if the proposed regulations are adopted after the 25-day public comment period, according to the press release. We will continue to monitor and report on legal and regulatory activity in this area.","Tuesday, September 10, 2019As previously reported on this blog, Upton’s Naturals Co. and the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA) filed a lawsuit challenging Mississippi’s law prohibiting cell-based, plant-based, or insect-based foods from being labeled as “meat” or a “meat food product” (i.e., “hamburgers,” “hotdogs,” etc.).

Eventually, the state legislature came around to the idea that making it illegal to use ""meaty"" terms on plant-based foods wasn't the greatest idea. This week, Mississippi's revised labeling rules—which allow meaty terms as long as they are accompanied by qualifiers like ""meat-free,"" ""meatless,"" ""plant-based,"" ""vegetarian,"" ""vegan"" or similar terms—officially went into effect, and as a result, Upton's Naturals and the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA) have officially dropped their lawsuit against the state.

""This is a total victory,"" Justin Pearson, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice (IJ) and the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in the announcement. ""Our clients simply wanted to continue using clear labels with the terms consumers understand best. In response to our lawsuit, the Mississippi Department of Agriculture has done the right thing, so there is no need to move forward with the lawsuit."" As IJ points out, Mississippi already had laws against misleading labels, so Mississippi's new rules—which had taken effect one July 1—specifically discriminated against plant-based meat, allegedly at the behest of the Mississippi Cattlemen's Association.

""We are thrilled with this common-sense outcome of our lawsuit,"" added Michele Simon, the PBFA's executive director. ""We hope that other states considering similar legislation will follow Mississippi's lead in allowing clear qualifying terms that our members are already using to communicate to consumers."" Recently, we've seen similar fights and lawsuits in states like Arkansas and Missouri.

But it turns out the next fight could happen on a federal level: Last week, Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, proposed a piece of bipartisan legislation—the Real Marketing Edible Artificials Truthfully (MEAT) Act—which states that ""any imitation meat food product, beef, or beef product shall be deemed to be misbranded unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word 'imitation' immediately before or after the name of the food and a statement that clearly indicates the product is not derived from or does not contain meat.""","Probably not often, but that was one of the concerns behind an initiative in Mississippi (and similar moves in other states) to bar plant-based meat companies from using butcher-like terms to label their products.

STARKVILLE, Miss. —More than a dozen high school students participated in the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute on Friday [March 23] at Mississippi State University.

Hosted by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, students from across Mississippi spent the day engaged in conversation about global food security with their peers, teachers, MSU faculty and administrators and various food security experts.

Attendees were officially designated Borlaug Scholars for their participation and are eligible for scholarships to Mississippi State University. The Borlaug Scholars pay tribute to the World Food Prize’s founder Norman E. Borlaug. To become a Borlaug Scholar, each student wrote a research paper about a developing country and a food security topic. Each project included innovative ways to improve global food security. The students presented their findings at the on-campus event.

“The Mississippi Youth Institute is a partnership program with the World Food Prize. It challenges high school students to explore the world’s most pressing issues related to food security,” said Libby Crimmings, the World Food Prize’s national education program director. “The World Food Prize’s founder, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was passionate about working with students. He believed if you want people solving these challenges when they are 60 years old, they have to be thinking about it when they are 16 years old.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a global food security champion, welcomed the students in an opening session.

“By 2050, the world population will surpass 10 billion. That means we will need to feed an additional 3 billion people at our global dinner table by the time this class of Borlaug Scholars reaches their 40s,” Keenum said. “That’s why we need young talented students like this who take an interest in the future of the world to try and make a difference, serve humanity and address these critical challenges.”

“It’s also why Mississippi State, as a leading land-grant research institution trained on improving food security on a global scale, is tackling many of these problems today. We are trying to address these challenges through science and research to figure out how we can advance productivity so we can feed the world.” Keenum added.

Scott Willard, associate dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, along with support from the entire MSU Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine administration, has been instrumental in seeing this institute come to fruition.

“Our college is thrilled to host the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute. Achieving global food security is essential as it becomes evident that we must feed more people with fewer resources,” Willard said. “This program provides a platform for high school students to formulate novel solutions to help solve one of the most pressing needs of their generation.”

Students also attended the college’s Charles E. Lindley Lecture. Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, presented on hunger in the Magnolia State. His presentation, “Mississippi: The Hungriest State in the Nation” explained how MFN is addressing food insecurity.

Top students from World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute will be invited to the Global Youth Institute in Iowa in October. Participating students also are eligible to apply to the Borlaug Ruan International Internship and the USDA Wallace-Carver Fellowship.

36,36,5 days ago,GazetteNET,Food & Farm: A ‘HIP’ way to bolster food security,"A few weeks ago, I went with my friend, Kathleen Chapman — or KC, as she’s called — to the February Winter Farmers’ Market at the Northampton Senior Center.

KC is a Southerner, a smart, funny artist and teacher who moved to Northampton from Mississippi in 2019. Shopping with her is always a good reminder of how blessed western Massachusetts is with relative abundance. Mississippi is a state that consistently ranks as the most food insecure in the nation, with a good many of its residents living miles from the nearest grocery store.

KC always remarks on the plenty of the Pioneer Valley, joking sometimes that someone needs to set up a swap between this area and the South, in which the South will ship dogs to Northampton in exchange for food.

The catch, however, is that food, along with everything else, is so much more expensive here than in Mississippi. KC, who lives in senior housing downtown, uses a combination of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — what people used to know as food stamps) and Survival Center groceries to help her stretch her fixed budget. At the Farmers’ Market, she also has access to an additional tool in the form of HIP benefits.

HIP is the Healthy Incentives Program, a state- and USDA-funded program that provides monthly incentives to SNAP households when they purchase fresh local vegetables and fruit at farmers markets, mobile markets, farm shares and farm stands. HIP automatically adds back any SNAP money spent at one of the above outlets, up to a certain amount. So, for instance, the SNAP money KC spends on local produce at the Winter Market is immediately added back to her Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, and, as a household of one, she can spend up to $40 a month on local produce via HIP.

It’s not hard to see how this might benefit the health and well-being of households with limited means. Nutrition research can be fickle and biased, but to my knowledge, there is no study that argues that increasing your daily intake of vegetables will do anything but improve your health outcomes.

And people have been using HIP. Since the program began in 2017, SNAP sales at farm retail outlets increased by a whopping 1,250%; to date, 88,000 families have used their HIP incentives, 45% of whom include seniors, and 30% of whom include children.

The program has been popular enough that the state has periodically had to halt its disbursement of HIP funding because it underestimated the demand for fresh, local produce among its low-income citizens. And besides produce, HIP can also be used to purchase edible plants, so that people who have a bit of growing room can spend their HIP allowance on veggie and herb plant starts, thus increasing their access to fresh produce for an entire season.

If these were the only benefits that accrued to the community via HIP, the program would already be an asset, but its value extends beyond the customers. HIP does a good amount of legwork in the effort to create a more sustainable food system by supporting local farmers as well.

For growers, the cost of organically raising, picking, washing, packaging and distributing produce while stewarding land in a holistic, sustainable way while paying themselves and their workers a living wage is undeniably high.

According to Olivia Pettingill of Wingate Farm, the HIP program has permitted farmers like her to cover their costs while feeding a more economically diverse range of people.

“HIP has significantly enabled a more equal distribution of high-quality produce to our local community,” she says, “and it’s done this while allowing small farmers to stay in business and even thrive.”

She points out that HIP has more lasting effects as well on the kind of general thinking and public curiosity that lead to greater food security. Local farmers try to grow produce and fruits that do well in our local climate, but that doesn’t always mean growing the vegetables that are the most conventionally recognized.

HIP incentivizes people to try different kinds of veggies that are more locally sustainable, and in doing so, it builds a marketplace that relies less on foods from far-flung places, thus reducing the carbon footprint of shipping.

SNAP Match

The program is not without its issues. As mentioned, there have been periods when it shut down for lack of funding, which is confusing and frustrating for those attempting to use their benefits. This inconsistency also limits farmers’ ability to plan, as well as HIP’s ability to make a sustained difference in people’s eating habits.

Also, if you don’t have any SNAP money left on your EBT card, you can’t access your HIP benefits, even though the two amounts are not dependent on each other. And a further issue is that the benefits are pretty specific: You can buy local vegetables and fruit, but other farm products such as eggs or meat aren’t covered.

In an effort to fill that gap, Grow Food Northampton, which operates the Tuesday Farmers’ Market and the current Winter Farmers’ Market, offers SNAP Match, a system in which Grow Food matches the amount of SNAP money an individual spends at the farmers market. (SNAP Match also doubles the match for the first $10 people spend.) In this way, farmers who sell products other than veggies aren’t left out, and people doing their shopping with SNAP benefits are given a wider selection of choices.

It’s rare, I think, to find elegant solutions where food access is concerned, and even rarer when food access, environmental stewardship and the local economy work together in any kind of synergistic fashion, which is why the combination of HIP and SNAP Match — and their potential to help further a smaller, more sustainable, and more equitable food system — is so ingenious.

The majority of SNAP Match is even funded locally, by Valley Home Improvement, which, over the last four years, has doubled the amount of assistance that Grow Food can provide to customers. Steve Silverman, Valley Home Improvement’s founder, says the company is keen on supporting local business and addressing food insecurity as well — values that are complementary and aligned in SNAP Match.

While SNAP Match will continue as long as Grow Food has the money to support it, the proposed state budget for the next fiscal year cuts HIP funding from this year’s $13 million to $5 million in 2022. Given the many benefits to both local farms and families who would otherwise lack access to sustainable fresh local produce, this seems short-sighted from every angle.

Why not keep the momentum going on a program that has demonstrated great potential to positively affect the health of the commonwealth’s most disadvantaged citizens while also allowing local farm businesses to thrive and grow food in a way increases our food security and decreases our carbon footprint?

After the events of the past year, with scary disruptions to the national supply chain due to COVID, it’s in everyone’s interest to take a closer look at the steps we can take to ensure that the bounty that KC remarked upon isn’t jeopardized — and the continued funding of HIP is one of them.

KC, by the way, came away from the Winter Market with beets and onions, eggs, a small amount of bacon for cooking with some dried lima beans, and a jug of maple syrup, which she uses to sweeten her coffee — a nice balance of items good for both body and spirit.

While on occasion the complexity of figuring out the various different systems available to help her access better quality food has been frustrating, she believes absolutely in SNAP Match and HIP as valuable resources that should be funded, and not just for her own sake.

“The vegetables are so expensive at the store that I’m hesitant to buy them,” she told me, “but here [at the Farmer’s Market], I can get these delicious fresh organic vegetables, and it’s helped me a lot. And the fact that the farmers are being supported is the biggest thrill to me.”

On Monday, the same day the law took effect, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant was sued by Upton's Naturals and the Plant Based Foods Association for violating manufacturers' First Amendment rights.

According to the new regulations, food made from plants—or insects—cannot be labelled as meat or ""a meat food product."" The law also bans food using animal tissue created from laboratory cultures from being labeled meat.

""They tell me that fake steak looks just like our real meat,"" Billy Hudson (R-Hattiesburg), told the AP. ""I don't want to eat meat grown by a test tube in a laboratory. If my constituents do, they ought to know what they're getting.""

Launched in 2006 ""with a focus on meat alternatives and vegan values"" Upton's Naturals offers a variety of vegan products, including seitan burgers and Ch'eesy Bacon Mac (made with wheat gluten). In court filings, the company claims using terms like bacon and burger ""increase consumer understanding of the foods' characteristics and communicate how the foods should be prepared and eaten.""

The Plant Based Foods Association adds that ""no reasonable consumer would be misled"" by the packaging.

But the $49.5 billion beef, poultry, pork and lamb industry isn't taking any chances: ""Our marching orders were to protect beef nomenclature,"" Danielle Beck, director of government affairs for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, told the AP in 2018.

According to GlobalData, 70% of the world population is reducing meat consumption. There's been 600 percent increase in Americans identifying as vegan over the last three years. And sales of plant-based meals shot up 20 percent between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to Nielsen.

The restaurant industry is taking notice: By the end of the year, the plant-based Impossible Whopper will be available at Burger Kings nationwide.

It's millennials who ""are most likely to consider the food source, animal welfare issues, and environmental impacts when making their purchasing decisions,"" says GlobalData consumer analyst Fiona Dyer.

But as consumers are turning to meatless alternatives, meat producers are pushing back: Twelve states have laws similar to Mississippi's—Louisiana's also bars non-rice products from being described as rice and sugar alternatives from being marketed as sugar. Tofurky Co. sued Missouri over its labeling law, though the case was settled out of court this year for an undisclosed amount.

And they're not the only ones with a beef: The dairy industry is balking at using labels like ""milk"" and ""mayonnaise"" in vegetarian and vegan substitutes like soy milk, oat milk and Hampton Creek's egg-free Just Mayo.","A new law in Mississippi bans vegetarian and vegan meat substitutes from using meat-related terms like ""bacon"" and ""meatballs.""

The story and summary were updated on November 30, 2020 to explain that Peco Foods disputes that it broke any laws. It says some workers detained in immigration raids failed to pick up paychecks and the money was later transferred to the Department of Labor so they could find the workers and pay them.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Three Mississippi chicken processing plants among those targeted in one of the largest workplace immigration raids in the U.S. in the past decade have agreed to pay back wages after federal officials found they failed to pay minimum wage and overtime to their workers.

The U.S. Department of Labor announced Nov. 20 that three plants have paid $45,719 in back wages to 129 employees.

The plants targeted in the investigation were a Canton complex owned by Peco Foods of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; a Morton complex owned by Koch Foods of Park Ridge, Illinois; and Pearl River Foods of Carthage, a company headquartered in Gainesville, Georgia.

The Labor Department’s Wage and House Division found the employers failed to issue final paychecks to multiple workers.

Peco denied violating minimum wage laws. It said 15 workers detained in the August 2019 raids failed to retrieve paychecks worth a cumulative $6,215.97. The company said it gave the money to federal officials so they could look for and pay the workers. The Labor Department said failing to pay the workers was a violation.

Officials also found that Pearl River Foods deducted so much money for uniforms that employees were illegally paid less than minimum wage. Investigators also determined Koch failed to include production bonuses when calculating overtime, another legal violation.

The Labor Department assessed a civil fine of $1,693 against Koch for employing a 15-year-old to work in meat processing. Children under 18 aren’t allowed to do that work under federal law.

Officials also raided A&B in Pelahatchie, PH Food in Morton and additional Peco Foods plant in Bay Springs and Sebastapol in the August 2019 raids, which led to the arrests of 680 workers accused of being in the country illegally or using forged documents to gain work.

The raids brought an outcry from critics who said some children had their parents swept up and that workers were unfairly targeted without going after the companies that employ them. In August, on the anniversary of the raids, officials said more than 125 people had been indicted on criminal charges. An unknown number of additional people have been deported in administrative proceedings without facing criminal charges.

Also indicted are four executives from two plants who federal officials said had harbored people in the U.S. illegally and assisted them with obtaining false documents to enable employment or making false statements about hiring workers without proper documents.

Salvador Delgado-Nieves and Iris Villalon worked at A&B, while Carolyn Johnson and Aubrey “Bart” Willis worked for Pearl River Foods. All have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial next year.

Federal officials have said the raids were justified because people in the country illegally steal Social Security numbers to gain work. Mike Hurst, the U.S. Attorney in southern Mississippi, also argued that people in the country illegally take jobs from American citizens and depress their wages.","It says some workers detained in immigration raids failed to pick up paychecks and the money was later transferred to the Department of Labor so they could find the workers and pay them.

42,42,"May 6, 2019",The Architect's Newspaper,"In Jackson, Mississippi, architects are taking on a citywide hunger problem","By more than one measure, Jackson, Mississippi, is one of the nation’s unhealthiest cities. In 2017, it was named the fattest city in America based on 17 indicators, including obesity rates, levels of physically active adults, and access to fresh produce. In fact, nearly one-fifth of city residents are considered food insecure. The state of Mississippi does not fare much better—for the last eight years, it was reported as the most food insecure state in the country, even though agriculture is the state’s top industry.

It’s not just that Jackson has only 17 grocery stores for a population of nearly 170,000—that’s one per nearly 10,000 people. But the food that is available is disproportionately tipped toward fast food and gas station items. As one scholar of Jackson’s food culture told the Clarion Ledger, “Hunger happens in between bags of chips.”

All of this is compounded by the city’s lack of viable public transit options. Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one. Even those with groceries or farmers’ markets in walking distance are discouraged by the lack of sidewalks or crosswalks. These conditions are undergirded by decades of generational poverty and disinvestment due to white flight, unfavorable tax policies, and the state’s aggressive efforts to cut resources for Medicaid and limit food stamps.

But Jackson also has a long history of civil rights activism, and its residents in 2013 and again in 2017 elected mayors who promised nothing less than wholesale social and economic transformation. For Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, addressing Jackson’s food access challenge is part of his promise to make it “the most radical city in the world.” But rather than enlisting conventional strategies, the city has mobilized its long-range planning division to lead a new design-based initiative. Bolstered by a $1 million public art grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access” brings together architects and artists alongside chefs, gardeners, food policy experts, and local institutions to facilitate a year of community-engaged interventions at three sites in the city. The project will culminate in a citywide exhibition in the spring of 2020, but ultimately it aims to establish a nonprofit research lab on food access that will operate on a permanent basis to sustain the momentum that is created.

The city invited an intriguing roster of architects and designers from around the country to participate in the multidisciplinary initiative: Kathy Velikov and Geoffrey Thün, directors of RVTR; Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Akoaki; Walter Hood of Hood Design Studio, and Jonathan Tate, who runs his namesake practice, Office of Jonathan Tate. Architects are central to the project, said Travis Crabtree, a senior urban planner with the city and one of the project’s coordinators. “When we first got the grant, people asked, Why are we spending $1 million dollars on an art project when we could feed people for a million?” he said.

Looking more closely at what these designers bring to the table may illustrate what can be gained from this approach. The question of access is at the heart of practices like the Toronto and Ann Arbor, Michigan–based RVTR, led by Velikov and Thün, who are both associate professors at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. In their ongoing project, Protean Prototypes, they conceive of public transit systems as platforms to address access to mobility, food, education, and health. They do this by mapping the social and spatial opportunities for access, connecting underserved areas with local actors who can bridge access gaps and by proposing lightweight spatial prototypes that overlay onto public transit infrastructure, such as bus stops and metro stations. The prototypes might include emerging tech like mobile produce vending systems and bike-cart shares alongside other programs with a small footprint like exercise equipment and book lending programs. Applying this method to Chicago, San Francisco, and Detroit, this complex systems approach brings together architectural and urban scale in new assemblages that amplify the resources already on the ground and take advantage of the larger urban context to channel them where they are needed most.

In Jackson, Velikov and Thün will focus their efforts at the Ecoshed, a 15,000-square-foot, open-air building on a 2-acre industrial site that borders two very different neighborhoods—the rapidly gentrifying Fondren and Virden Addition, one of the poorest in the city. For Fertile Ground, the Ecoshed will demonstrate a self-sustaining closed-loop food system and host the food lab, and eventually host the Fertile Ground nonprofit.

Anya Sirota and Jean Louis Farges of Detroit-based Akoaki will also focus their efforts at the Ecoshed. Their practice has engaged with the problem of food access through four years of work with an urban farm in Detroit, the Oakland Avenue Urban Farm. Sirota is also an associate professor of architecture at Taubman. Detroit provides a uniquely fertile landscape for thinking about urban food access. According to Sirota, Detroit has 1,300 urban farms, but none of them are sustainable. At the 6-acre Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, sustainability for Sirota and Farges has meant strategizing beyond economics alone. To them, urban farms are hubs for urban regeneration, and they realized that multiple layers of activity and programming were needed to realize that potential. Like Velikov and Thün, they see architecture as a way of “amplifying the activity that’s already happening on the ground, to stitch together new and productive alliances.”

Detroit may be 1,000 miles from Jackson, but the connection between the two cities runs deep. Like Jackson, Detroit is a majority African American city, with many residents who have ties to Mississippi and other southern states. Thus, the Oakland Avenue farm grows many heritage products from Mississippi. Likewise, the association to agriculture is similarly fraught in both cities; as Sirota noted, “We are highly attuned to the idea that going back to the land isn’t necessarily representationally positive to everyone.” Rather than framing urban farming as a return to an idyllic past (and glossing over the history of slavery and policies that led to the dispossession or denial of land to freed slaves), Akoaki’s urban farm work is firmly sited in the urban. “We’ve become astutely aware that the neo-rural is not rural; it’s something that deserves an aesthetic that hybridizes all the aspirations of the city and combines them with the necessity to produce picturesque landscape and food.” Thus the practice’s design of pop-up performance spaces next to the farm’s kale fields for the Detroit African Funkestra is based on the colors and shapes of shuttered music venues across Detroit.

Another participating architect, Oakland-based landscape architect Walter Hood, has extensive experience designing cultural and urban landscapes. Hood, who is also a professor at University of California, Berkeley’s will focus his efforts at Galloway Elementary in Jackson. The 4.3-acre, publicly owned lot is currently a playfield for a local elementary school. According to the city’s planning department, this site is located in a lower-income residential neighborhood with little public space and bordered by a major street dominated by fast food establishments. The theme here will be on food and community.

This is a good fit for Hood. His projects in Charleston, South Carolina; Macon, Georgia; Detroit, and Philadelphia, among other cities, demonstrate a steady thread of incorporating community feedback, local culture, and collective memory into landscape and urban design. In his Water Table installation at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, Hood tapped into the ecology and history of rice production by mounting thousands of Carolina Gold rice plants in circular planters on a platform in a school courtyard, essentially recreating a rice paddy in downtown Charleston. The project resurfaced the link between rice production and the history of the slave labor that made Carolina’s rice industry possible. Afterwards, the project was dissembled and distributed, planter by planter, across schools and institutions in the area, and lived on to continue the conversation. This archaeological approach also surfaces in many other projects by Hood Studio, including its master plan for Detroit’s Rosa Parks neighborhood. Hood’s work has long engaged with the idea of “being a protagonist in design,” and, in reflecting on the future work in Jackson, asked, “How do we make a landscape powerful, so that once you do it, it has a resonance?”

Finally, at Congress Street, the third Fertile Ground site, New Orleans–based architect Jonathan Tate will bring his experience with food culture and exhibition design to a downtown storefront space. The Congress Street site is close to the heart of government and is intended to amplify the project to public officials and policymakers who work nearby.

For Tate, who designed the Southern Food and Beverage Museum in New Orleans, the task includes not only the adaptive reuse of an existing building but also the design of an outdoor parklet that invites the public in through greenscape and seating. The challenge will be to bring it all together—the art, the history, the contributions of numerous partners, and of course, engage critical feedback, in a downtown that goes quiet at 5 p.m. on weekdays. “Instead of a veneer you’re walking through, it’s about bringing the space of the building out into the street,” he explained.

The architects, along with other Fertile Ground team members, began site visits in April, and will develop their proposals until the citywide expo in 2020.","Jackson is designed around the car, but many residents, whose wallets are already stretched thin on federal food assistance dollars, don’t own one.

44,44,"Jun 10, 2020",Northside Sun,“Fertile Ground” Documentary Airing on Mississippi Public Broadcasting and Public Broadcasting,"June 01, 2020 – The City of Jackson announced today that Fertile Ground , a documentary examining the extensive impact the industrial food system has on Jacksonians, will air on June 10th at 7pm CST on the Mississippi Public Broadcasting television station and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) will make the documentary available online here. On June 21st at 5pm CST Mississippi Public Broadcasting will re-air the documentary on their television station.

The Fertile Ground documentary follows the life of local residents experiencing challenges accessing healthy food options, while also detailing the systematic policy failures that have allowed “food swamps” to thrive. Featuring interviews with local farmers, food activists and city leaders, the documentary also spotlights the growing possibility to transform Jackson’s local food system. This documentary is part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Art Challenge. View the trailer here.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said, “This project is so important because we live in abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity and in our society there is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options. In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. And, in spaces where people have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. And so, as a city we should return the love and show our citizens that we want them to have an abundance of healthy food alternatives. The Fertile Ground documentary does an excellent job of portraying just how prevalent the problem of food access is here in our city and I am proud to have members of this administration actively working to remedy this issue for our citizens.”

The documentary team is comprised of homegrown, a host of Mississippi talent including, Executive Producer - Robby Piantanida, Director Alex Warren, Director of Photography, Aaron Phillips, Producer - Jocephus “Skipp” Martin, Sound Mixer, Taiwo Gaynor, Set Photographer - Drew Dempsey. Salam Rida, City of Jackson Urban Designer said, “The documentary is an art project that inspires a larger conversation about the issues with our global food system. The COVID-19 crisis has brought a newfound awareness to Jacksonians about where their food comes from and how global supply chain volatility can disrupt our everyday lives. At the City of Jackson we hope communities can use this moment to move forward on how we would like to address food access and decentralize some aspects of our food system.”

The documentary is part of a larger initiative called “Fertile Ground: Inspiring Dialogue about Food Access”, which uses public art as a medium to inspire dialogue about food access in Jackson, Mississippi. The City of Jackson was awarded the grant from the Bloomberg

Philanthropies Public Art Challenge in November 2018. Mike Bloomberg said, “The Public Art Challenge is designed to strengthen communities like Jackson with moving works of art that highlight complex problems - and foster public discussion about solutions. Fertile Ground does just that, telling the story of a city that has too few healthy food options. It’s also the story of people – like Mayor Lumumba, artists, farmers, urban planners, and other local leaders – who are creating new opportunities to deliver better

options. As the Coronavirus proves especially dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, and as African-American communities suffer the highest death rates, Fertile Ground has taken on new power and urgency.”

In addition to this documentary, the project is made up of physical installations deployed within food deserts across the city, community engagement sessions, a podcast series, performance art, a food policy roadmap, and a project opening expo that has been postponed due to COVID-19. The project brings together an interdisciplinary network of artists, designers, architects, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, policymakers, and community members to discuss the complexities of the City’s food system.

45,45,"Nov 29, 2019",Mississippi Today,World class chefs making a name for themselves and Southern food culture in cities throughout Mississippi,"BILOXI — There was a time when great chefs were found only in the confines of great culinary cities, such as Paris, New Orleans, Rome, or New York City. But, those days are long gone. There was also a day when small town restaurants served exactly what your mom served at home, and a trained chef was nowhere to be found.

Those days, too, are of the past.

These changes and many more are a consequence of the amazing food revolution that has swept this country, all fueled by the Food Network, the 1980s slow food movement and the access to information the internet has made available to everyone.

Today, cities throughout Mississippi boast world-class restaurants and chefs. Some of the chefs you may have heard of — Chefs Vish Bhatt and John Currence, both from Oxford, Alex Perry of Ocean Springs, Cole Ellis of Cleveland, Derek Emerson and Jesse Houston of Jackson — are all James Beard Foundation nominees (the Academy Awards of the food world). But it doesn’t take a James Beard nomination to make a great chef.

Some chefs have built reputations with starts at prestigious culinary schools, such as the Culinary Institute of America, or apprenticed with well known chefs, but others worked their way up through the ranks, starting by prepping vegetables or washing dishes. For those who have made it to the top of their profession — starts humble or prestigious — the drive to get it right and be the best was in the end more important than the starting point. Names like Chef Ty Thames, Chef Kristian Wade, Chef Milton Joachim and Chef Adrian Halpaus come to mind of other very talented Mississippi chefs.

But these new and talented chefs are not serving traditional fare — not by a long shot. The slow food movement has inspired many chefs to go from farm and Gulf to table. That means fresher produce and ingredients and support for local farmers. New techniques, such as sous-vide and insistence to make everything from scratch has also had a major impact. Combine these attributes with many chefs’ desire to stay Southern, and the result is a new fusion of traditional and cutting edge menus in restaurants across the South.

It’s impossible to mention every chef in the state who is doing creative things, elevating Southern food (country cooking) into the art form that it really is, but two names come to mind that perhaps best exemplify the level of excellence today’s chefs display. Chefs Patti and Matt Kallinikos both work for the IP Casino Resort Spa in Biloxi. They are married, and both are chefs of remarkable merit.

Chef Matt is the room chef (casino-speak for chef de cuisine) at Thirty-Two (IP Casino Resort and Spa, Biloxi), one of the best fine dining restaurants in the South. It has been recognized by many awards, including being a AAA Four Diamond restaurant and Wine Spectator’s Restaurant Wine List Award. Thirty-Two could be described as the most romantic restaurant in Mississippi, for its beautiful appointments and stunning view (especially at sunset). But even without the beautifying ambiance, the food that chef Matt serves would be stunning in any environment.

Chef Matt started as a 15-year-old dish washer, was fascinated by the things he saw going on in the kitchen, decided to go to a culinary school and was accepted into the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park in New York City. It’s one of the most prestigious culinary schools in the country. He received an associate degree in culinary arts, a bachelor’s degree in hospitality and culinary arts and two post graduate degrees in kitchen and dining room management, all from the Culinary Institute of America. He spent time at the Top of the Hub, one of Boston’s best restaurants, then moved to the Thirty-Two in 2005.

Chef Patti took a different route, attending the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, where she studied in the culinary and pastry program. Her background is in stark contrast to Chef Matt’s, certainly less studied, but she is just as much a master in her skills. She joined the IP culinary team as the pastry chef just five years ago, and is the chef in charge of a pastry kitchen that runs full-speed seven days a week, 24 hours a day. If you have ever tried a dessert from Thirty-Two, Tien, Bay View Café or any of the other restaurants at the IP, you know just how talented she is.

Thirty-Two is a from-scratch kitchen. Chef Matt says, “If we need something, we make it,” and that includes all sauces, stocks, soups, bacon, tasso, Italian sausage, pasta, literally everything but the most basic of ingredients. Chef Patti doesn’t have the luxury of making many sauces or charcuterie, but absolutely every cookie, cake, and pie that comes out of her busy kitchen is made from scratch. There is never a short cut or cheaper substitution.

Both chefs design their own menus with approval from executive chef Shannon Johnson, of course. Chef Matt has seasonal menus to contend with, taking into account not only holidays and the spring to winter associations they make for the food they serve, but also the seasonality of ingredients. Chef Patti’s menu planning is a bit more complex, as she has to come up with a different dessert menu for each restaurant. It’s not a skill that is come by lightly.

Chef Patti has pound cakes, banana bread and pies by the score to make but don’t think it is all the traditional sweets you might be used to. She makes a deconstructed pumpkin pie that involves a ginger apple crust and hazelnut topping and an Italian inspired chocolate budino (an Italian pudding cake) that will knock your socks off. Even with the enormous quantities of bakery good her kitchen produces, her level of originality is remarkable.

Chef Matt has his hands full grilling wagyu beef to perfection, making sous vide seared scallops, escargots à la Bourguignonne, lobster and summer truffle mac and cheese, and Thirty-Two’s signature gourmet burger, to touch ever so lightly on the fall menu, typical of the fare Thirty-Two produces in variety and creativity.

Chef Matt and Patti are at the top of their profession, and a visit to thirty-Two or one of the IP’s other restaurants is a true culinary adventure.

But it isn’t just in the rarefied air of a casino kitchen — with the best of all equipment and ingredients — that amazing culinary adventures can be found in Mississippi. It may be the deep fried black eyed peas at the Blue Canoe in Tupelo or the 36-hour smoked pulled pork at the Blue Biscuit in Indianola, but Mississippi chefs, famous or not, are making a name for this state’s food culture and in a big way.","Today, cities throughout Mississippi boast world-class restaurants and chefs.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State students studying landscape architecture, architecture and graphic design are bringing home a national honor for their learning garden concept.

A cross-college consortium of MSU students conceptualized a suite of garden designs aimed at helping schools build learning gardens based on their educational needs. The Living Room: A Freeware Learning Garden Focused on Health, Food and Nutrition Education received an Honor Award for Student Collaboration at the American Society of Landscape Architects, or ASLA. The team, which included 10 landscape architecture students, 10 architecture students and one graphic design student, was recognized at the society’s recent virtual conference.

Cory Gallo, MSU associate professor of landscape architecture in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, served as faculty advisor for the group.

“For the fifth time since 2012, the design/build studio has earned a national design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Many of these awards have been in collaboration with architecture and graphic design faculty and students, including this most recent one,” Gallo said. “The society chose only 35 awards out of 560 applicants this year. The recognition is a continued testament to the unique cross-college process that has been ongoing at Mississippi State for the last decade.”

Gallo explained the garden’s concept was further illustrated in two proof-of-concept designs—one that has been installed at Galloway Elementary School in Jackson and another scheduled for installation at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU in spring 2021.

“The team worked with educators and stakeholders to tailor the design to each site’s individual needs. For instance, the garden at Galloway Elementary emphasized ample teaching space aligned around five themes including math, science and art, which allows teachers to use the garden for almost every subject. This ensures that the garden will be used for not just food education, but as an integral part of the classroom,” Gallo said.

Hans Herrmann, MSU associate professor in the School of Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art and Design, said students benefited from the collaborative hands-on experience.

“The first-hand feedback from trying to construct what was previously just an idea is something that traditional classroom instruction cannot approximate. Issues of material supply, site conditions, transportation logistics, tools and equipment all come into focus once you are standing on the site and realize that you’re the one who has to get the job done,” he said.

Herrmann said he was proud of how multiple disciplines joined together, including MSU alumni, to bridge between areas of expertise and gaps in experience.

“The work of these projects is more than just the hours in the field building and installing the gardens. It’s about building the team, taking ownership and responsibility for key components, and working with other organizations in Mississippi to make the state we call home that much better for the next generation,” he said.

In addition to the national award, the project was featured in a chapter of “Design-Build: Integrating Craft, Service, and Research through Applied Academic Practice,” a textbook by University of Washington Landscape Architecture Professor Daniel Winterbottom which was published by Routledge this year.

In addition to Gallo and Herrmann, Associate Professor Suzanne Powney in the Department of Art’s graphic design concentration advised the graphic student on the project. Associate Professor Ryan Walker in the College of Education’s Department of Curriculum, Instruction and Special Education consulted on the project as well.

Collaborators included The Fertile Ground Project, a Jackson-based program inspiring dialogue about food access; JH&H Architects in Flowood; Utah’s Pikus Concrete; and Pennsylvania’s Significant Developments. The garden at the Starkville Oktibbeha School District Partnership School at MSU is funded through a grant from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi Foundation.

“’Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes—part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program—came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers—giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce.

“When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers. They were just left out. There was a big void that was left,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director.

Despite Challenges, Program Helps Farmers, Families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers—a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss.

“Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit.

“This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale, Burkett said, because of an incredible upswelling of community support.

“Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” added the farmer. “It brought the community together.”","Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

49,49,"Dec 26, 2018",Mississippi Today,Gloster’s first grocery store in decades highlights statewide food insecurity,"GLOSTER — For residents here, food excursions would range from the 30 minute round-trip to Centreville, to the 2-hour round-trip to Baton Rouge, La. The nearest Walmart and Kroger, over in McComb, are roughly an hour’s drive each way.

A small rural town in Amite County, Gloster is just south of the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi; it’s less than two square miles in size and home to around a thousand residents, according to the 2016 American Community Survey.

Companies are scared, despite minimal competition, that they won’t make enough of a profit to survive in towns with a small consumer base — towns like Gloster. In a sparsely populated state like Mississippi, this is a common dilemma, especially when it comes to access to food.

But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving. The town’s first grocery store in decades.

“We needed this,” said Felecia Nayland, 56, who’s lived in Gloster all her life. I just hope and pray that they continue to do good business here so they’ll stay here.”

Nayland said previously, access to fruits and vegetables in town was “pretty much non-existent.”

Limited access to grocery stores in rural areas is one reason Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Over half a million Mississippians did not know where their next meal would come from between 2015 and 2017, according to the latest report from Hunger Free America, “The Red, White, and Blue Hunger Wave: A 2018 United States Hunger Atlas.”

Many here see the public-private partnership that brought the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Gloster as part of the solution to an all-too-common problem in rural towns around the state — availability of affordable, fresh food.

Lavonne Sanders, 50, has also lived in Gloster her whole life, and said the last time the town had a store like this was when she was a little girl, about 30-40 years ago. That too was a Piggly Wiggly.

“I love this store, it’s made a big change,” Sanders said. “We don’t have to go Centreville anymore. You don’t have to spend that gas money now.”

While the store licenses the Piggly Wiggly brand, the shop itself is independently owned and operated by Jason Cook. Cook, from Hattiesburg, learned about Gloster a few years ago while at a previous job. The company was considering expansion into the small town, but in the end opted against it. Since then, Cook opened a Piggly Wiggly in Angie, La. — but he didn’t forget about Gloster.

“I came back here when I was financially able to,” Cook said, “just because after having talks with the community I knew how bad it was here. So the Lord led us back here.

“Most companies will turn their nose up at a store doing under $100,000 a week in sales. My approach is a little different; I do it to operate a business, but I also do it out of just having humanity and compassion. The way I do things aren’t necessarily the way anyone else does them.”

The city approved a tax incentive for the store, which will reimburse Cook for exterior improvements like the parking lot and sidewalk repair. Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened. The store created 22 jobs.

“If you can get into a town where the government will help you get established there to lower your overhead (cost), then you can make it,” Cook said. “You don’t get greedy, and you don’t take advantage of people, you just operate. I live within my means. I’ve got to make a profit in order to pay the bills, but I’m not trying to become a millionaire off of it.”

After years of driving out of town, often out of county, to find fresh produce and essentials, residents were prepared to fill Piggly Wiggly; by 3 p.m. on a Monday, the grocery store was the busiest place in Gloster.

“It’s brought some life back to the town,” said Rachel Stevens, 54, who works at a business on Main St. around the corner from the new store.

Stevens and other residents discussed having to cram all their grocery shopping into a couple trips a month.

“We’d have to stock up. It’s really inconvenient when you run out of stuff. We had no choice, no options,” she added.

More than just the convenience, residents think the Piggly Wiggly will lift spirits and create momentum for the town.

“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago. “I knew it was hyped up when people, even in the other counties, would say, ‘Did you hear about the Piggly Wiggly?’ It’s the biggest thing in a long time in this area.”

“It’s gonna be some more changes coming,” Sanders said. “I believe.”

“To hear over the course of several years how badly a grocery store was needed and wanted in the town, and now that the town finally has it, it really is a feeling of bliss and happiness,” said Rep. Angela Cockerham, D-Magnolia, who represents Amite County.

Cockerham, an attorney at Wise Carter, also serves as Gloster’s lawyer. She added that the incentives Piggly Wiggly received could help attract business in other places in Mississippi.

“In the future, I’m hoping that there will be other mechanisms that will help areas like Southwest Mississippi that encourage partnership (between towns and businesses),” she said.

Statewide solutions and the Legislature’s role

Much of the state — about 1 in 5, according to Hunger Free America — struggle with consistent access to nutritional food.

The phenomenon ranges from urban areas, like Hinds County, where 1 in 4 are food insecure, to rural areas like Jefferson County, which had the highest food insecurity rate in the country in 2016 at 36 percent, according to Feeding America.

Can the public-private partnership in Gloster work in the rest of the state? What can the state Legislature do to help?

Every year, lawmakers propose legislation ultimately aimed at reducing food insecurity by either helping grocers located in low-income communities mitigate losses or making groceries more affordable for the general public.

Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Jackson, has pushed for legislation to give tax credits to grocers locating in underserved communities. A 2018 bill would have given these stores a job tax credit equaling 10 percent of its payroll.

Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, authored a 2018 bill to give income tax credits to grocers to offset the cost of purchasing locally grown produce in an attempt to incentivize stores offering healthier food options.

Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, has introduced bills for the last several years to allow state funds to be used as a direct source of funding for grocery stores under the Small Business and Grocer Investment Act passed in 2014.

Each of these bills died in committee with little fanfare.

Simmons said his proposal to use state dollars directly is unlikely to garner the support of leadership. Tax incentives, similar to those Mississippi gives large companies like Nissan and Continental Tire, might be more palatable, Simmons said.

Right now, Mississippi is leveraging tax incentives for industries to locate in the state, but those benefits do not apply to businesses like grocers.

“Because of the number of employees, the kind of wages they’re paying, (grocers) wouldn’t qualify for the same type of incentives that an industry would,” Simmons said.

The federal government’s primary vehicle for providing at least some food to the poor is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly allowances based on the size of the recipient’s household. Mississippi has one of the largest federal matches of any state for these assistance programs.

“We in Mississippi have depended so much on the federal government to feed the hungry in the state that we ourselves are not focused on it,” Simmons said. “We have not stepped up to the plate to give adequate dollars to match that to help those citizens out of their particular situation … We’ve not had to.”

To slightly ease the burden of affording groceries for Mississippi residents, Rep. Jeramey Anderson, D-Escatawpa, repeatedly proposes legislation to remove the sales tax levied on food items for all shoppers. SNAP purchases are already exempt from sales tax. A version of the same bill from Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, would have also increased all other sales tax from seven to nine percent.

“In my opinion, the best way to provide a tax cut to our constituents, especially those in the middle and working class, is to eliminate this sales tax (on food),” said Anderson, who plans on reintroducing the bill next session. “And I know that of course there has to be a make-up of the revenue lost from taxes on groceries, but I think phasing it out, which is what this bill does over five years, is a responsible way of doing that without hitting the state’s revenue so hard. I think the sales tax on groceries is one of, if not the most, regressive taxes we have.”

Both bills also died, as well as several bills to raise the state minimum wage, which currently mirrors the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, to between $8.25 and $10.10.

Considering low wages across the state, Mississippi families cannot always rely on a job to provide food security. The “U.S. Hunger Atlas” also shows that nearly 13 percent of working adults, or 156,213 employees, also faced food insecurity between 2015 and 2017.

The report also calculated that Mississippi residents would need to spend an additional $273 million each year on food to meet their basic nutritional needs. That’s roughly one-third the amount Mississippi spent, $841.8 million, through the SNAP program in 2017.

“When you get into a situation and you do it for so long, it just becomes a way of life,” Simmons said. “If we do more at the state level, we could actually become a state of change, where we are transitioning our people from poverty to prosperity.”

At the Mississippi Center for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on racial and economic issues, Madeline Morcelle and Kathryn Rehner promote a wide-range of solutions to tackle the root causes of food insecurity.

“In order to achieve a food secure Mississippi, the state legislature will need to take on a broad range of social, economic, and physical barriers to healthy food access,” Morcelle said. “Those include everything from poverty, which is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of people still aren’t paid a living wage; measures to improve the minimum wage would improve food security. I think tax incentives and other measures to incentivize investments from food retailers are important.

“Ultimately, though, there isn’t one solution. It will take a combination of state reform addressing the multiplicity of factors that result in food insecurity, from lack of transportation, to inadequate income, to lack of opportunity in many communities, to protecting and strengthening our essential nutritional assistance programs like SNAP that provide that emergency lifeline to struggling families.”","But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving.

The news represents a significant expansion of a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) pilot program introduced in 2019 that aimed to open up online grocery shopping to those on public assistance. This program is even more critical now, as in-store shopping puts consumers at risk of contracting the deadly novel coronavirus.

To date, participating retailers in the USDA pilot program have included Walmart, Amazon, ShopRite and other smaller chains.

Amazon confirmed to TechCrunch that the 11 new states that now support using SNAP for online grocery include those that were added starting last week through today, Thursday, May 28.

The initial expansion of the pilot added New Mexico, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, which all became active last week. On Tuesday of this week, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and New Jersey rolled out. And today, Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia were added as well.

With these additions, Amazon customers on public assistance can shop online for groceries across a total of 25 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. At checkout, they can pay for groceries using their SNAP EBT.

Including the new states, Amazon now offers the use of SNAP EBT for online grocery in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

However, Amazon is not the only retailer offering online grocery for SNAP EBT customers in these 25 states.

According to the USDA’s website, SNAP users can now order their groceries online through either Amazon or Walmart in these markets.

The site also indicates that Amazon is the only retailer supporting the District of Columbia at present. In addition, ShopRite supports the use of SNAP for online groceries in Maryland, New Jersey and New York. And Wright’s Markets is participating in the pilot program in Alabama.

The USDA’s website indicates several more states are now in the planning phase, so they can add online purchasing as a shopping option soon. These include Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wyoming.

As part of Amazon’s participation in the USDA program, it not only enabled the use of SNAP EBT as a payment method, it also made its Amazon Fresh service available to SNAP recipients in states where Fresh is available without requiring a Prime membership. And it offered free shipping on both Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry orders.

At launch, Amazon had said the USDA pilot program would “dramatically increase access to food for more remote customers.”

However, in the coronavirus era, access to online grocery can be a life-saving measure for some.

The pandemic has complicated access to food for those on SNAP benefits, and for high-risk individuals on SNAP in particular. These consumers now have to risk getting COVID-19 every time they go out for groceries themselves. And as more workers become unemployed due to the economic impacts from the pandemic, more people are joining public assistance programs like SNAP.

In light of the pandemic, the USDA said it would fast-track any state that wanted to join the pilot. California, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas, West Virginia, D.C., North Carolina and Vermont were just approved in April, for example. In May, the USDA approved Minnesota, Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, New Mexico and Wyoming.

In less than six weeks, the USDA has expanded access to the program to a total of 36 states plus D.C., it says, though many are not yet live. When they launch, however, online purchasing for groceries will be available to more than 90% of SNAP participants, the USDA has noted.","To date, participating retailers in the USDA pilot program have included Walmart, Amazon, ShopRite and other smaller chains.

54,54,"Jan 16, 2020",Washington Post,"14 states, D.C. and New York City sue to stop Trump plan to slash food stamps for 700,000 unemployed people","In the lawsuit, attorneys general from the District, Maryland, Virginia, New York, California and other states, warned that “drastic” cuts would affect 688,000 to 850,000 adults without children. They asserted the justification for the cuts were based on no evidence and ignored local labor market conditions.

“States are in the best position to evaluate local economic circumstances and to determine where there are insufficient job opportunities such that work requirements would be ineffective,” they said in a 99-page lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Washington. The new rule “eliminates State discretion and criteria” and will terminate “essential food assistance for benefits recipients who live in areas with insufficient jobs.”

The lawsuit is the latest confrontation between the Trump administration and Democratic-governed states, one set off by aiming changes at a program that serves poor and unemployed people and disproportionately affects large cities. Other proposed changes would push 3 million off food assistance.

In the lawsuit, states along the northeastern U.S. corridor joined by California, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Oregon said their governments would face heavy new administrative and financial burdens, economic damages and increased costs from “the negative health effects of malnutrition and instability.”

“President Trump’s unlawful changes to the SNAP rule will strip nutrition assistance from tens of thousands of struggling District residents, putting their health at risk while driving up District health care costs and needlessly hampering our economy,” D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) said in a statement.

“We are bringing this lawsuit to protect SNAP recipients nationwide and to check an administration that is attempting another end-run around Congress to advance its heartless agenda,” Racine said, adding the Republican-led Congress in 2018 rejected the changes as punishing people struggling to find jobs.

Racine said in the District, for example, while the region is booming for high-income workers, many of the 13,000 recipients directly at risk of losing food aid each month once cuts take effect in April are low-skilled adults without degrees or training who must compete for a small slice of low-wage jobs.

“Locking them out of food assistance will not encourage them to work. . . . It will force them to choose between putting food on the table or keeping a roof over their heads,” Racine said., making “it harder for them to acquire the skills and training they need to find jobs.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents between the ages of 18 and 49 can receive benefits for a maximum of three months during a three-year period, unless they are working or enrolled in an education or training program for 80 hours a month.

States have been able to waive this time limit to ensure access to food stamps during the ups and downs of reentering the workforce. Before this rule, counties with an unemployment rate as low as 2.5 percent were included in waived areas.

AD

AD

The new rule, set to take effect on April 1, 2020, will tighten the criteria for states applying for such waivers, making 6 percent the minimum unemployment rate for a county to receive a waiver.

In announcing the change last year, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said, “This is about restoring the original intent of food stamps . . . moving more able-bodied Americans to self sufficiency.”

Perdue cited the economic expansion as a basis for tightening states’ waivers. He said the number of Americans receiving benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has grown from 17 million to more than 36 million since 2000, although the unemployment rate is now lower.

AD

Two other proposed rule changes, not yet final, aim to cap deductions for utility allowance and to limit access to SNAP for working poor families.

AD

A study by the Urban Institute shows the combined impact of these rules would cut 3.7 million people from SNAP in an average month. Benefits would be reduced for millions more, and 982,000 students would lose automatic access to free or reduced-price school meals.

Critics say the changes would bite even harder during the next economic downturn.

In a joint conference call with reporters, New York State Attorney General Letitia A. James (D) added, for unemployed people from rural Appalachia to the Mississippi River delta to the Bronx in New York, “SNAP benefits are often the difference between eating and going hungry. It’s that simple.”","Other proposed changes would push 3 million off food assistance.

55,55,"Aug 21, 2019",Mississippi Today,Meat processing companies targeted in ICE immigration raids awarded millions in state grants,"help

Peco Foods Inc. and Koch Foods, both

food processing companies targeted in immigration enforcement raids in early August.

Since 2009, Mississippi taxpayers paid nearly $4 million toMississippi offers a variety of economic development programs to businesses, including tax incentives, grants and loans to encourage companies to locate or expand in the state, with the ultimate goal of bringing jobs to Mississippians. Mississippi Development Authority spokesperson Melissa Scallan said that none of the food processing companies raided in the recent immigration enforcement operation — the nation’s largest in a decade — received traditional tax incentives from the state.The companies benefited from other incentives awarded to local governments for help with infrastructure improvements, including road construction and water and sewer systems. In some cases, the awards went unspent and returned to the state because either the company or local government could not meet certain requirements. When taking the unspent funds into account, the state has earmarked close to $9 million for the Peco and Koch companies in the past decade. MDA, the state’s economic development agency, administers grants through its Community Services Division, its Financial Resources Division and the federal Hurricane Katrina Community Development Block Grant to assist communities affected by the 2005 hurricane. The development authority awards grants through its Community Services Division and the federal Katrina grant to local entities, such as towns or counties, to make public improvements benefiting nearby plants in exchange for those companies’ promises to add jobs to their facilities. Grants from the Financial Resources Division go directly to companies, but they must have a local sponsor, such as an economic development group. Regional development agencies also assist companies in receiving similar grants. In 1999, the Central Mississippi Planning and Development District prepared a grant application for the city of Canton, according to a 2018 report celebrating it’s 50th anniversary , which led to $1.2 million in infrastructure improvements to support expansion at the local Peco plant. Here is a list of grants the state awarded to three of the companies — Peco Foods, Inc., Koch Foods and Pearl River Foods — targeted in the raids:Bay Springs received a $1,093,480 Katrina block grant and spent $1,092,800 of it “to replace damaged and underperforming equipment at the city’s existing wastewater treatment facility.” In exchange, Peco promised to retain 550 existing jobs at its Bay Springs plant, one of those raided in August.The town of Lake received a $1.3 Katrina block grant and spent $1,289,416.26 on infrastructure improvements, such as water and wastewater extensions and a new access road for Peco’s new feed mill in exchange for 28 new jobs.Morton received $712,500 in Community Service Division funds and spent $712,326.78 making improvements on publicly-owned Koch access roads. Koch created 36 jobs.Morton received $1.06 million in Community Service Division funds and spent $897,639.50 making improvements on publicly-owned Koch access roads. Koch created 80 jobs.Leake County received a $1.5 million Community Service Division award for improvements to publicly-owned sites and buildings, but bids for the project came in much higher than $1.5 million and the county could not make up the difference. It left the money on the table and Pearl River Foods paid for the improvements.On behalf of Peco, local development agency Golden Triangle LINK received a $2.5 million grant for building improvements and $500,000 in “MS Works” funds for workforce training through the development authority’s Financial Resources Division. Peco acquired an empty warehouse in West Point to transform into freezer, cooler and storage space. The state awarded Peco the grants in exchange for 300 new jobs, but Peco “was not certain it would be able to create 300 jobs,” Scallan said, so the funds were never transferred. Peco received 10 years of ad valorem tax exemptions from West Point and Clay County and reduced rates for city water, according to a May, 2018 story in The Columbus Dispatch . Any unspent funds are “deobligated” and returned to the state’s coffers.

56,56,"Apr 30, 2018",,Peco Foods to open $40M Mississippi plant,"JACKSON, Miss. — An Alabama-based chicken processor will open a plant in northeast Mississippi to make and distribute frozen chicken products.

Peco Foods on Monday announced its plan to invest $40 million in West Point, hiring 300 people over the next four years.

The nation's eighth-largest poultry processor, Peco says it needs more capacity to supply its customers, including restaurants, grocers and food service distributors.

""The addition of this new cold storage facility is a key component of our growth strategy and is perfectly tailored to meet our current needs as well as future plans,"" Peco Foods CEO Mark Hickman said in a statement.

State and local incentives, including grants, property tax reductions and a discounted water and sewer rate, could benefit Peco by $13.7 million over 10 years.

Tuscaloosa-based Peco bought a vacant 185,000-square-foot cold storage warehouse in December that it plans to renovate to house the operation, said Mississippi Development Authority spokeswoman Tammy Craft.

She said the state will give Peco a $2.5 million grant to improve wastewater treatment and infrastructure. West Point has approved a cheaper water and sewer rate for high-volume users, which will save Peco up to $3.9 million over 10 years, depending on usage.

Peco will build a plant to pretreat its wastewater before sending it to the city for further treatment. West Point has additional water and sewer capacity to offer because it previously served the Sara Lee/Bryan Foods complex, which closed in 2007.

The state will also provide $500,000 for worker training.

West Point and Clay County have approved 10-year property tax breaks worth an estimated savings of $6.8 million over that time.

Clay County had suffered for years from persistently high unemployment. The county had a 5.4 percent jobless rate in March, compared to a 4.5 percent jobless rate statewide. Officials said last fall that the company will pay workers $15 to $17 an hour.

""This company is providing jobs in a sector we're familiar with, in a more advanced environment, with a high rate of pay for our citizens,"" West Point Mayor Robbie Robinson said in a statement.","— An Alabama-based chicken processor will open a plant in northeast Mississippi to make and distribute frozen chicken products.

57,57,"Dec 2, 2020",Eater,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped From the USDA’s Food Box Program,"This story was originally published on Civil Eats.

Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation. “‘Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes — part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program — came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South with diminished access to produce.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers — giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce. “When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director. “They were just left out. There was a big void that was left.”

Despite challenges, program helps farmers, families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers — a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss. “Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit. “This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale because of an incredible upswelling of community support. “Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” Burkett said. “It brought the community together.”

It all seemed like a grand success. So, the Federation and its farmers were surprised when then USDA rejected its application for the third round of Farmers to Families. The sting was especially severe given the long history of discrimination against Black farmers by the USDA. And they weren’t alone; other small farmers were also caught off guard by the lack of new contracts, and some were stuck with unharvested crops they had planted for the boxes.

A USDA spokesperson told Civil Eats by email that the agency modified the program after the first two rounds “to address feedback from nonprofit organizations that there was not adequate distribution of all different types of food boxes.” As a result, vendors had to bid for new contracts. They are now required to provide “combination boxes” (a mix of meat, dairy, and produce), identify their community partners and “last mile delivery” arrangements (in response to previous criticism about lack of such services), and gear their distribution to so-called “opportunity zones.”

Due to the shift, the contracts went exclusively to a small number of large national food distributors. At least half of the initial contracts were not renewed in the fall, and that number has been whittled down even more in the final months of the program.

For Burkett’s co-op, the loss of the contract meant a slew of surplus crops with no customers. And while restaurants had started reopening, most are only operating at one-third of their typical capacity, he said.

Now, says Burkett, “the food service companies don’t put much produce in their boxes.” His co-op is hopeful it can get another contract, if the program continues — but the farmers must make alternative plans for now. And without a sense of where he can sell next year’s crops, he doesn’t know what to plant.

Communities left without food

The changes to the food box program have also led to chaos and hardship for many of the organizations on the receiving end, according to interviews by Civil Eats and several complaints filed by lawmakers. (One of the largest recipients is alleged to have redirected $3 million to its own nonprofit despite a lack of track record in delivering food to people in need, House Democrats have alleged.)

The USDA acknowledged that while some nonprofits that did not receive boxes in the first two rounds received them in the third round, others received fewer boxes or none at all. “USDA made painstaking efforts to ensure comprehensive coverage for the states, with the goal of covering every county in the country,” the spokesperson said.

But none of the groups previously served by the farmers affiliated with the Federation are currently participating in the program, and that means thousands of families in the South are lacking access to food.

The Federation has intimate knowledge of the Black community in the South and the local groups and community organizers who serve it. As a result, its boxes reached people who “are usually not on anyone’s radar,” said Chawnn Redden, the Federation’s regional marketing coordinator. “We sought out where the real need was, as opposed to just taking the easy route and giving it out to the nearest food bank.”

“We sought out where the real need was, as opposed to just taking the easy route and giving it out to the nearest food bank.”

The senior center in Laurel was one such example. The boxes that landed there were directed to hundreds of families. Cooley, the coordinator, ran food drives, worked with local pastors and community organizations, and drove to the homes of elders who were stuck at home. Reaching people by word of mouth and finding elderly men who seldom ask for help was especially important, Cooley said, and it’s something that traditional food banks rarely do. “Some people have a lot of pride, but when they had a chance to get the food, they would reach out to me,” she said.

Since the Federation’s contract ended, area churches have continued giving limited assistance, but they haven’t had the capacity to fulfill the community’s growing need, Cooley said. She hasn’t found another food box distributor.

“People still call me,” she said. “They ask: ‘Miss Cooley, when are we going to get some more food?’ I don’t feel good at all when somebody truly needs help and we have nothing to give them.”

Another of the Federation’s partners was Mississippi Rising Coalition, a nonprofit that delivered about 500 food boxes every week to both rural and urban communities across the state over the summer.

“These areas are not only impacted by COVID, but they’re also food deserts where nutritious food is hard to come by, expensive, or inaccessible,” said Lea Campbell, the organization’s president. “The food box program filled a really desperate need and I don’t understand the rationale behind ending the [Federation’s] contract.”

James Skinner, the director of the group’s Food Security Initiative, personally drove a rented U-Haul truck from the Gulf Coast to Mississippi’s Pine Belt to deliver the boxes to community centers, immigrant advocacy groups, international students, and a university food pantry. Hundreds of volunteers worked to make the deliveries and distribution a success. “It was very disappointing when the contract ended,” Skinner said. “The hardest thing was to turn people away.”

Mississippi Rising has not been able to connect with one of the new USDA-approved box distributors since its contract ended in September. The group has continued to occasionally provide food when they receive direct donations from farmers, but Skinner and Campbell say the donations in no way match the consistency and volume of the food box program.

Gainesville-based Hispanic Alliance of Georgia, another group the Federation supplied over the summer, is having a similar experience. “The company that supplies [food boxes to] Georgia is in Florida and is not answering the phone,” said Vanessa Sarazua, the Alliance’s executive director. “We can’t reach them and we need to be able to provide this food.”

In Gainesville, where the Latinx community is more than 40 percent of the population and most Latinos toil in low-wage jobs such as poultry processing plants, the more than 40 agencies that are part of the food bank distribution system rarely serve their needs, said Sarazua. The boxes helped fill this gap.

For communities that are still receiving boxes, the contents have changed significantly. Despite the promise of “locally sourced” produce, as touted in Trump’s letter, many of the boxes now come packed with processed meat and other commodities. According to the USDA, for rounds three and four, contractors were required to include “1 or 2 locally grown fruit or vegetable items, as available, and if none available, add additional items of vendors choice.”

“In essence, it’s gone from a model where we’re serving collard greens and peas to serving hot dogs,” Blanding of the Federation said. “Yeah, people are eating. But I think it matters [what they eat]. So, this shift is concerning.”

Limited model program continues

Knowing the program had been a lifesaver to both farmers and hungry families, the Federation is working to build off of the USDA model and continue providing its own food boxes. The organization has started using private funding to pay member farmers for their produce and continue to send food boxes to its partners.

But the Federation’s private efforts have only been able to provide a fraction of the previous amount of produce, said Redden. “[The shift] dramatically reduced what we could purchase from farmers who had hopes they would be participating through the end of the year.”

Moving forward, Blanding says that providing families with a box of raw ingredients direct from farmers is an approach that makes sense with or without the pandemic: “It’s a model to build off for providing food during disasters, as well as something that could be extended as part of the social programs of our country.”

Sarazua of Hispanic Alliance of Georgia agrees. “Hopefully, the USDA can look at it as a future model to more directly reach vulnerable children and families.”

Struggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloat

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state's food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a long-standing initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

""All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,"" said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. ""When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.""

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don't have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic's early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

""If food banks can't take more product (from the California program), farmers are going to go out of business,"" Linkhart said. ""That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.""

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

""That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,"" said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. ""It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.""

Raudabaugh said the state's dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers' distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don't make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

""We're providing many hundreds of percents more (to food banks) than pre-pandemic,"" Raudabaugh said. ""Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these (partnerships). It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.""

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

""The money has to be there to justify the harvest,"" Michael said, ""and this solves some of that problem.""

On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen's small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers' pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

""It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,"" Van Laanen said. ""It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.""

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he's already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi's Farm stay afloat.

""It was really timely,"" Chichester said. ""It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early time frame.""

Karen Affeld, the development group's executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

""Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,"" she said. ""That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.""

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state's Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California's that launched in 2014.

It's a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they're harvesting crops bound for food banks.

""Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,"" said David Bobanick, the group's executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another 4 pounds are donated by farmers.

""Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,"" he said. ""It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.""

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

""Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,"" said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets' food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she's heard from parents who couldn't otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture _ known as CSA _ in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program's website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

""You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,"" said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. ""People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.""

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

""We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,"" Lebeaux said. ""Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.""

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

""We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,"" said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. ""One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.""

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

""If there's one silver lining,"" she said, ""it's that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.""","Farmers and food banksStruggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloatAs the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers.
And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state's food banks needed to triple their food supply.
The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks.
In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses."

During World War II, approximately 40% of recruits couldn’t enlist due to poor nutrition. Today, over 70% of would-be recruits are ineligible for a number of contributing factors, including nutrition and obesity. It’s become a matter of national security, according to an organization of retired generals.

""Seventy years ago, a military leader said a lack of nutritional food in our children and young adults contributed to military readiness,"" said retired Army Maj. Gen. Larry Harrington. ""We've made some improvements but we have a long, long way to go.""

Mission: Readiness is a national group made up of over 75 retired admirals and general across the country that focuses on helping children stay in school, in shape and out of trouble. The organization issued a report Wednesday, Improving Childhood Nutrition in Mississippi, that highlighted the need for federally funded programs that give children access to fresh and healthy food.

Wednesday morning, three generals from Mission: Readiness met with agencies from across Mississippi in a roundtable discussion in Jackson about child nutrition.

Nationally, 72% of those 17 to 24 years old are not able to qualify for the military due to lack of education, criminal background, substance abuse or medical disqualifiers. Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility in the nation, with 76% of eligible 17- to 24- year-olds not being able to qualify, said retired Army Brig. Gen. Roger Shields.

Obesity is one of the leading disqualifiers, he said. Twenty-five percent of 10- to 17- year-olds were obese in the state in 2018, while 40% of adults were obese.

""We believe that America must prioritize efforts to combat childhood obesity as a matter of national security,"" Shields said in a written statement released after the roundtable. ""Improving access to fresh and nutritious foods for all children will help reduce childhood obesity and ultimately ensure that the military has a pool of recruits.""

There is a ""network"" of federal nutrition programs available across Mississippi working to combat the issue but many don't know what is available to them, said retired Army Maj. Gen. Augustus Collins, a former adjutant general of Mississippi.

Collins cited the National School Lunch Program, Summer Food Service Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

According to the Mission: Readiness report, in 1945, Gen. Lewis Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, testified in front of Congress that at least 40% of recruits were rejected during World War II for reasons released to poor nutrition.

The National School Lunch program was founded the following year ""to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals,"" Collins said.

Recalling Hershey's testimony, Collins said, ""The lack of nutritious food for our children is actually a threat to national security.""

""It was back in World War II and it is today,"" he said.

Statistics: Nutrition, obesity and the military

In Mississippi, 76% of youth between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot serve in the military due to issues such as lack of education, a record of crime or substance abuse, or medical disqualifiers; higher than the national average of 71%.

Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility among all 50 states.

Obesity is one of the main medical disqualifiers. Individuals who would otherwise be eligible to serve in the military are being disqualified due to excess weight.

In Mississippi, nearly 40% of adults and 25% of children ages 10-17 were obese in 2018, the highest in the nation. In some counties, the percentage increases to 45.

Mississippi has the second highest rate of child food insecurity in the country. In 2016, over 24% of Mississippi children experienced food insecurity. The national average is 18 percent.

Between 2015 and 2017, over 17% of all households in Mississippi experienced food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at a higher rate for obesity.

Mississippi has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country at 17%.

In Mississippi, 37,000 participants, or 7% of National School Lunch Program participants, accessed the Summer Food Service Program, meaning a large majority of students may not have access to healthy food during the summer break.

61,61,"Dec 21, 2019",NPR,New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion,"New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Danny Moloshok/AP Danny Moloshok/AP

Some low-income college students are among the 688,000 food stamp recipients projected to lose benefits as a result of a Trump administration rule announced Dec. 4. While the rule explicitly targets ""able-bodied adults without dependents,"" it also limits food assistance for a share of college students at a time when campuses across the country are grappling with how to respond to food insecurity.

The new rule makes it harder for states to waive the requirement that adults work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — benefits. Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.

""As long as a student is at least half-time, they are not considered an [able-bodied adult without dependents] subject to SNAP work requirements, so that new rule would not impact them,"" says Kathryn Larin, director of the Education Workforce and Income Security Team at the Government Accountability Office. ""The group that it would impact would be students enrolled less than half-time.""

Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

This is because Congress created the program with the image of a ""traditional"" student in mind: someone entering college directly from high school, financially reliant on their parents, with no income or dependents.

But this archetype is far from universal, says Parker Gilkesson, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy who specializes in income and work supports. Only about 1 in 4 students attend a four-year institution immediately after high school.

Many college students are older or are parents themselves. And few have a financial safety net: Countless families are spending all they have just to send their children to college, let alone pay for their food and other necessities, she says.

""[Congress] did recognize there are circumstances where students could and should be eligible for SNAP, and so they set up a number of exceptions from this prohibition against college students getting SNAP,"" Larin said. ""What are those exemptions, who is eligible for them, how do you meet those exemptions? That's where the confusion comes in.""

In order for college students to be eligible for SNAP, they must first meet income and asset limits, household qualifications and immigration status requirements. Those who are enrolled less than half of the time — as defined by their school — can then qualify under standard SNAP rules.

Students enrolled more than half of the time may qualify for SNAP by meeting one of a number of criteria, which include being responsible for a dependent child younger than 6, working at least 20 hours a week in paid employment, receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, participating in an on-the-job training program, being outside the 18-49 age range, and being unable to work for health reasons.

""No matter if they're full time, part time, half time, even taking one class, [students] are taking the initiative to really better themselves and grow and further their academic career,"" Gilkesson says. ""They shouldn't be punished for not being able to find steady employment in the economy that we are in today.""

Gilkesson says it is unclear exactly how many students will lose benefits as a result of the new rule, particularly because able-bodied adults without dependents are not necessarily also classified as students if they are enrolled part time. But she adds it is clear that the rule will disproportionately impact young people, people of color and those who struggle to find employment, leaving them without much-needed food assistance.

""Most people who receive SNAP who can work, do work,"" she says. ""But there are a lot of jobs and specifically low-wage jobs out here that have volatile schedules ... people can be let go at any time, so we shouldn't allow people to go hungry just based on their ability to maintain work.""

According to National Center for Education Statistics data on unduplicated year-round enrollment, 5.8 million students were enrolled in public two-year colleges in fall 2017. About 2.1 million were full time, and 3.7 million were part time. Gilkesson says that while there are more students enrolled part time in community colleges than in four-year institutions, food insecurity exists on all types of campuses.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat. This was among the findings of a 2018 Government Accountability Office report that also said almost 2 million at-risk students who were potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits in 2016.

Only 4 in 10 students who are potentially eligible for SNAP are actually enrolled in the program, according to Gilkesson. This is due to perceived stigma as well as confusion about who can apply for SNAP and how to do so.

""The information that's available from the USDA ... is difficult to find on their website and also hard to understand, it's very legal language,"" says Larin, adding that people whose jobs it is to connect college students with these resources may struggle to understand the criteria. Advocates worry that the new rule will exacerbate this confusion.

The GAO report released last December made two recommendations: that the Food and Nutrition Service (which is part of U.S. Department of Agriculture) improve the information on its website to make it easier to find and understand, and that it take a more active role in sharing states' best practices for connecting students to SNAP. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations but has not yet implemented them as of mid-December 2019.

Gilkesson received SNAP in college and was a SNAP worker at a county agency in North Carolina prior to her current job. She says it was not until she saw the other side of the ""intricate"" process that she realized how much information she never received as a student, both because she didn't know what to tell workers and because they didn't always know what to ask.

As a SNAP worker, she saw the impact that fresh food and hot meals had on clients' lives.

""You need food to live, you need food to work, you need food to thrive,"" Gilkesson says. ""And hunger does not make people more employable either.""

In fact, she adds, hunger makes it harder for people to find well-paying jobs that align with their skills and often leads to cycles of being laid off, having to find a new job quickly and missing out on the opportunity to gain the education, training and skills necessary for more meaningful and sustainable employment.

She says research shows that SNAP encourages work and that the idea that people experiencing poverty don't want to get jobs is ""implicit bias.""

The Trump administration says the new rule is intended to promote SNAP recipients entering the workforce. Critics have slammed the change for eliminating food assistance for nearly 700,000 people, many of whom already struggle to find work.

Gilkesson says it is concerning that college students will lose benefits, but the prevalence of food insecurity should be an issue regardless of who is experiencing it.

""No one should be hungry,"" she says. ""That's a basic necessity. And when we start to think about it in that way, we really will start to see the policy change that we need to see.""

62,62,"Aug 27, 2020",WSAW,Chopped champ Nick Wallace raises awareness about food insecurity and how communities can help,"WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Having access to healthy food is a global challenge and one that impacts thousands of US cities and over 40 million people nationwide. For many Americans -- particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and rural areas -- small grocery stores that once helped to feed the community have been closed and replaced by convenience stores, and liquor stores that primarily sell ultra-processed junk and snack foods.

According to Feeding America, even in the world’s greatest food-producing nation, children and adults face poverty and hunger in every county across America. The statistics are alarming:

In 2018, more than 37 million people struggled with hunger in the United States, including more than 11 million children.

A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life.

Children are more likely to face food insecurity than any other group in the United States.

In Mississippi—which has the highest obesity rate of any state—over 70 percent of food stamp eligible households travel more than 30 miles to reach a supermarket. Adults living in “food desert” counties lacking large supermarkets are 23 percent less likely to consume the recommended fruits and vegetables than those in counties with supermarkets. As part of Dole’s promise to sustainably provide good nutrition for 1 billion people by increasing access to under-served communities, the brand recently launched an initiative, partnering with Boys & Girls Club, Up in Farms, Smoothie King, which addresses nutritional access and education needs in one of America’s largest food deserts.

Nationally recognized Chef Nick Wallace joined NewsChannel 7 at 4 on Thursday to discuss food insecurity, how we can educate communities about proper nutrition, and how people can help in their own communities. He also showcased simple, healthy dishes that promote optimal nutrition and discussed the unique approach Dole is taking by empowering kids to make better choices by learning about where their food comes from and how to cook it.

63,63,"May 8, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Mississippi identified as most food insecure state in U.S. - The Vicksburg Post,"By Mississippi Today

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.

Dole chose Jackson, Mississippi, due to the city being one of the nation’s largest food deserts.

“Our program goes beyond donations to address the critical challenges of accessibility and affordability, as well as nutrition education in communities around the world,” said Pier Luigi Sigismondi, President of Dole Worldwide Packaged Foods. “Jackson will serve as a blueprint for how we’re going to tackle these challenges in other food deserts using a hyper-local model. Together with partners, we’re building a foundation that will drive systemic change within individual communities and our society at large.”

Dole has seen the negative impact on the community of Jackson due to the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of access to full-service grocery stores, farmers’ markets, and other vendors that sell nutritious fruits and vegetables has created food deserts and food swamps across the country, a press release explained.

Shoppers can nominate the next city that will be named as Dole’s Sunshine for All location. Selections will be made by Dole based on needs such as access to fresh foods. The second Dole Sunshine for All destination will be announced on Giving Tuesday, December 1, 2020.

As noted earlier, Jackson was chosen because it represents the conditions of a food desert. It has only 20 grocery stores, and of those stores, less than 5 percent stock locally-grown fresh produce. In contrast, there are 70 fast-food restaurants, 60 convenience stores, and 150 gas stations that primarily sell unhealthy options.

Dole has partnered with local chefs and organizations to help get the word out and spread the word about the benefits and ease of working with fresh produce.

With the confidence of a Food Network chef, Braxton, a parent of five and grandmother of three, put a skillet on the burner, poured some oil into the pan, and let it heat up before throwing in some chopped onion, frozen corn, frozen lima beans (called butter beans in the South), and black-eyed peas, narrating all the while. After covering the pan and letting it all heat up, she added stewed tomatoes, okra, and seasonings.

“Okra is the last vegetable I put in because it’s easy for it to fall apart,” said Braxton, who hails from Mississippi. “Okra has a bad rap. I’m standing up for okra!”

This virtual dinner party is part of a Portland, Oregon-based program called Grandma’s Hands, a platform for Black grandmothers to share family recipes and food traditions with future generations. So far, the 12 grandmothers involved have prepared four monthly meals for 30 to 40 participants at a time. In addition to delivering the food they make along with a bag of fresh produce grown by farmers of color to the participants throughout the community, the program brings everyone together virtually to partake of the food while sharing recipes and tips.

Though the focus of Grandma’s Hands is to facilitate community engagement and reconnect community members with culturally grounded natural foods and agricultural practices, the program may also help reduce food insecurity by teaching the younger generation the economic benefits of cooking at home for their families.

“Our [modern] life is not conducive to being healthy,” says Chuck Smith, co-founder of the Black Food Sovereignty Coalition (BFSC), which helps run the program. “Cooking as a regular family activity has been squeezed out of people’s schedules.” And yet, he stressed the fact that connection with food is a pathway to stronger identity in the Black community. “When your [diet] is consciously connected to your cultural identity, then you can be more intentional in selecting what you eat and how you prepare it,” adds Smith.

The idea for the series grew out of freewheeling conversations about sustainable food and food access that Willie Chambers and Lynn Ketch from the Rockwood Community Development Corporation (CDC) had with Lisa Cline and Katrina Ratzlaff, the CEO and advancement director at Wallace, a community health clinic.

Cline and Ratzlaff were eager to find out more about food access in Rockwood, a diverse neighborhood of the Portland suburb of Gresham, because many of their patients at Wallace are food insecure. Rockwood, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Multnomah County, has many fast food outlets but only one grocery store. And that lack of access to nutritious food has alarming health consequences for residents, who suffer from diet-related illness at a higher rate than residents of any other part of Oregon. According to Brad Ketch, president of the Rockwood CDC, life expectancy there is a full decade shorter than it is in the rest of Multnomah County.

At the meeting, Cline and Ratzlaff began reminiscing about their own food traditions. “I said something like, ‘My memories of cooking and sharing food were standing by my grandma at the kitchen counter,’” Ratzlaff said. “‘I think a lot of folks are like that. Grandmas are the anchor. In many communities, they take care of the kids and do the cooking.’” Chambers, in turn, reminisced about his wife, Vanessa, a grandmother of eight who loves being in the kitchen with their grandchildren. “She’d give them aprons, and they’d all have a tool,” he said. “And they enjoy it!”

Chambers was reminded of the Bill Withers’ song Grandma’s Hands, and before he’d even nailed down the concept, they had the perfect name. The idea for the dinners took shape quickly.

Connecting Over Food

Grandma’s Hands started in June and takes place on the third Saturday of every month. It’s funded by a specialty crop grant from the Oregon Department of Agriculture and run by the Rockwood CDC and BFSC. Originally, the plan had involved in-person dinner parties at Rockwood’s Sunrise Center, which has a spacious commercial kitchen, but COVID-19 toppled that idea and they moved the gatherings online.

Every month, a group of six to 10 grandmothers, recruited through word of mouth, gets together in person at the Sunrise Center, dons masks, and cooks up meals for the participants. One grandma takes charge of each month’s meal and also offers to answer questions about the recipe or culinary tradition. Some participants pick up their meals at the center, while others have volunteers deliver them.","I’m standing up for okra!”This virtual dinner party is part of a Portland, Oregon-based program called Grandma’s Hands, a platform for Black grandmothers to share family recipes and food traditions with future generations.

Mississippi is one of just three states without a tax break on groceries — a choice that directly contributes to suppressed economic opportunities for grocers, farmers and their employees; the most severe hunger epidemic in the nation; and costly public health consequences.

In short, our sales tax on groceries is financially and morally irresponsible, and it must go.

Eating is necessary for survival, yet satisfying this basic human need takes a bigger bite out of the household budgets of low-income families than wealthier ones. This is especially true in Mississippi, where one in five Mississippians and one in four children statewide lack adequate access to safe and nutritious food — the highest hunger rates in the U.S.

In 2017, our 7% sales tax on groceries cost an average-sized household an average of $604 based on average meal costs statewide. With less to spend on groceries, low-income Mississippians cannot afford fresh and nutritious food options. Instead, they are forced to turn to low-cost and unhealthy alternatives that contribute to high rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and infant mortality.

With policies like the grocery tax in place, it is no wonder that hunger cost Mississippi’s health care system an estimated $1.08–2.22 billion in 2015 alone.

By reducing consumers’ food purchasing power by hundreds of dollars each year, the grocery tax hurts economic opportunities and earnings for Mississippi’s grocers and other food retailers, farmers, and their employees. Past research on grocery taxes across the U.S. illustrate these financial harms.

For example, a 2015 study found that even when compared to an alternative income tax that would produce an equal amount of state revenue, Kansas’ sales tax on groceries reduced rural grocery stores' economic output, decreased employment opportunities, and lowered wages for workers.

A number of studies also suggest that grocery taxes can drive cost-conscious shoppers across state lines to purchase food. Every state that borders Mississippi beats our 7% sales tax on groceries.

Like the vast majority of states, Louisiana exempts groceries from its state sales tax.

Arkansas taxes groceries at less than 1%.

Alabama and Tennessee tax groceries at 4%.

Mississippi’s regressive grocery tax policy may cost grocers, food retailers, farmers, and their employees in Mississippi’s 33 border counties significant economic opportunities.

Mississippians overwhelmingly support grocery tax reform. An April 2019 Millsaps College/Chism Strategies poll found that 69% of voters believe that Mississippi should change how it taxes groceries. Will newly elected and returning lawmakers in 2020 answer their rallying cry for change?

By Patrilie Hernandez, MS

It was almost one in the morning when I ended my shift as the hostess of an upscale Latin American restaurant in downtown St. Louis city when I got a glimpse of something I will always carry with me; a small group of young Black men gathered around a trash dumpster, chuckling amongst each other as I exited the restaurant through the kitchen’s back door into the employee parking lot. The first thing I noticed about them was their unkempt clothes, so my immediate assumption was that they were experiencing homelessness. Some were smoking cigarettes while others picked through the discarded food that had been dumped by the nearby restaurants after the dinner rush a few hours before.

One of the men quickly mumbled something towards me as I made my way towards my car (probably asking for some change) but the rest of the group ignored my presence as I unlocked the door, sat in the driver’s seat, put on my seatbelt, and turned on the car engine.

The reason I will always remember these few moments is that they stirred up so many unexpected feelings that I ended up spending many years trying to sort them out.

The main feeling was confusion. Why did seeing them dig through a dumpster for food surprise me so much? As the daughter of young, working-class Puerto Rican parents living in the South Bronx and other parts of New York City during the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had seen my fair share of hungry addicts asking my parents for money or something to eat outside of our apartment building or the subway.

When we moved into the suburbs some years later, we would often go into the city to visit extended family and I vividly remember seeing similarly unkempt people lined up outside of homeless shelters or under bridges as we would drive by on our way through Queens, to the lower east side of Manhattan, before we entered the Holland Tunnel to cross the river to “safety,” otherwise known as northern New Jersey. As hard as my parents tried to move farther and farther away from the face of poverty (both literally and figuratively), I never forgot what people that were chronically “hungry” looked like: people that had no clue where their next meal was coming from, people that would eat as much as they could when they could, because food for tomorrow was never guaranteed.

Sitting there in my car, I was thinking about how just a few hundred feet away and just a few hours ago, it was common for customers to wine and dine their paychecks away on steaks, ceviche, and cocktails while we (the servers and front of house staff who depended on decent tips to pay rent) catered to their every request and food allergy. Meanwhile, a few hundred feet away in the opposite direction, the nonprofit housing organization next door had their own daily food lines; serving meals nowhere near as decadent to predominantly Black folks that had been pushed out of this neighborhood by “urban renewal” the decade prior.

A wave of anger and sadness then started to sink in.

During the first few years of my life, my parents used SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps or EBT) and WIC and I was on SNAP for a good part of my 20s. So it’s safe to say I knew how it felt not to make enough money to put food on the table. But it had never really dawned on me that in a country where we produce and throw away more food than nearly a dozen developing nations combined, whether you were truly hungry (or food insecure) was never really a matter of proximity to the nearest grocery store, farmers market, or restaurant, but a matter of proximity to power. I realized there in that parking lot that I was occupying a food landscape with vastly different realities depending on your socio-economic class (the one you were most likely born into) and the shade of your skin.

I wish I could say sitting in my car on that cold winter night in 2007 jolted me into the right side of fighting for a racially just food system. The truth is, even as a mixed-race, working-class Puerto Rican (albeit with light skin privilege), I was still complicit in perpetuating problematic, particularly anti-Black behaviors and ideas around the health and social disparities experienced by urban, low-income BIPOC communities.

It wasn’t until I was confronted with my own internalized anti-Blackness and anti-Indigeneity (manifested through my family’s aversion to our own Afro-Indigenous roots, my deeply dysfunctional relationship with food and my body, and ultimately, an eating disorder diagnosis), that I began to come to terms with the role that white toxicity and colonization plays in how I thought about food insecurity and food access.

The Civil Rights Movement and Hunger in America

We can’t talk about the politics of food insecurity in the United States without talking about systemic racism. At first glance, the magnitude of the issue seemed to enter the public eye on the heels of the Civil Rights Movement, when Senators Bobby Kennedy and Joseph Clark toured the Mississippi Delta for the 1968 CBS television documentary, Hunger in America.

While many historians and academics are quick to assert that the documentary was the first to highlight food insecurity in the United States, Dr. Laurie Green, author of the book “The Discovery of Hunger in America: The Politics of Race, Hunger, and Poverty, 1967-1977”, contends that Black and Indigenous civil rights activists were the true force behind the federal response. The 1967 hearings held in Jackson, Mississippi by the Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Manpower, and Poverty centered the testimonies of voting rights activists and labor activists on the negative impacts of food insecurity, not only on the physical body but also on brain development and mental health. Another important part of this movement were the successful breakfast programs founded by the Black Panthers (that the federal government later adopted after criminalizing the Black Panthers). Initiatives by those centering Black liberation were the real heroes behind pressuring the federal government to fund programs and projects to address food insecurity in the US.

But this history was never shared with me in the ten years I spent in predominantly white-led food justice and advocacy circles. Past and current Black and Indigenous food sovereignty efforts were rarely centered; many nonprofits and food banks would love to pitch ideas like subsidized voucher programs for farmers markets or corporate food drives where employees would be incentivized to donate the dusty canned and shelf-stable items that sat in the back of their cupboards as primary ways to address food insecurity. Additionally, “healthy eating” and cooking education programs for these communities would be touted as the key that would make these efforts even more successful. It was common for these institutions to recruit and send white or white-adjacent individuals (like myself) into low income Black and brown communities to conduct “mission” oriented work, and implement programming derived from the deficiency-based, “white man’s burden model” more commonly known as “the white savior complex.”

For the majority of my career, I volunteered/worked for organizations that maintained the idea that neighborhoods with concentrated areas of Black and Indigenous people living in poverty are lacking or broken, and that we were here to “fix” their lives. For many years, I chose to exploit my proximity to whiteness as a way to justify entering “underserved” or “under-resourced” communities as a cooking instructor or nutrition educator in order to “save them from themselves.” The reality, however, is that I was a part of a rotating cast of privileged outsiders who would show up at schools or local recreation centers attempting to relate to the program participants for a short period of time, and then move on when grant or program funding ceased. What it took me a long time to realize is that I was often causing more psychological harm and trauma to the children and communities than if I had never entered their lives in the first place. Not only that, but I was also projecting my disordered body beliefs and food behaviors onto children and families that looked up to me because of my professional expertise and nutrition degree.

The “Obesity Epidemic”: Food Policing and Fat Phobia

About two years after Michelle Obama revealed her “Let’s Move” campaign in 2008, I was already part of a larger food justice community eager to partner with “anti-obesity” programs that aimed to tackle the “Hunger Obesity Paradox.”

This “paradox” was first introduced in 1995 after a leading pediatrician published a report suggesting a relationship between food insecurity and “obesity.” This report seemed to provide “evidence” validating the argument that lack of “healthy” food choices resulted in higher weight status among food insecure individuals, thus explaining their poor health outcomes. Of course, there was no mention of how medical neglect and discrimination due to classism and racism negatively affect health more than individual health behaviors, which has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A few years after this report was published, a panel of NIH tapped medical experts lowered the BMI cutoff for the “overweight” category from 27 to 25 (reportedly because it was easier to remember) thus making millions of people suddenly “overweight.” As overweight and obesity rates literally grew overnight, the fear-mongering behind the dangers of a possible “obesity epidemic” was thrust into the spotlight by media outlets and an already fatphobic medical field.

Nonprofits and policy experts leveraged these headlines and studies over the next decade in an effort to bring attention to the ways that not having reliable and affordable access to a variety of food on a consistent basis did, in fact, harm health. Even if this implicated body size as the primary driver of health, which many know is not the case.

Still, many food justice activists and advocates were adamantly convinced that poor people suffering from food insecurity also often lived in fat bodies because: 1.) they didn’t know how to prepare healthy meals on a limited budget, 2.) they made unhealthy food choices and were too lazy to exercise, or 3.) they were simply unfamiliar with healthy food because of the lack of high-quality grocery chains in the area.

But thinking that food insecure individuals mainly experience poor health because they make “unhealthy”, “uneducated” or “irresponsible” decisions about what they eat, and not about the larger systems of oppression that impede equitable access to health services and care, is rooted in white toxicity and colonization.

Dr. Ashante Reese, food anthropologist and author of “Black Food Geographies: Race, Self Reliance, and Food Access in Washington D.C.” says these widely-circulated beliefs result in a narrative that “African Americans and other people of color are reduced to bodies that need to be regulated and changed” and efforts that focus solely on individual behavior changes as the solution only further perpetuate the idea that “Black people need fixing.”

What we consistently see is that poor people experiencing food insecurity are more likely to be publicly shamed for their food choices, their body shape, and weight. We also see the same food moralizing, food policing, and fatphobia sustained through proposed policies like SNAP restrictions, Soda Taxes, initiatives like Healthy Corner Stores, Produce Prescription programs, and community nutrition programs that are very often led by white women unloading their fatphobic and healthist ideology on women of color.

What these programs and policies actually do is further marginalize low-income Black, brown, Latinx women and mothers, who are often forced to restrict their own food intake and sacrifice their own ability to properly nourish themselves in order to make sure their children have enough food to eat. There is a questionable level of hypocrisy in suggesting (and even promoting) that women of color who are already experiencing food insecurity should restrict or modify their food intake even more in order to lose weight or avoid gaining weight.

There is an abundance of evidence that our food system is steeped in white supremacy, systemic oppression, and colonialist ideology. Food justice/food access activists and advocates should be asking ourselves if we are equally as committed to examining how we are internalizing harmful, especially anti-Black narratives around food choice, interrogating what is deemed “healthy” by dominant, white supremacist power structures, and asserting that our worth is not reflected by the shape and size of our body.

The time needed to travel to stores to access healthy food can be a burden for many families, particularly in rural areas and urban areas located in food deserts. This problem is further exacerbated in tribal communities where the healthy food options can be limited and travel requirements to access stores with a variety of healthy foods are significant.

An evaluation by the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (ITCA WIC) found that by setting travel distance goals for healthy food access to nearest authorized stores they could evaluate the overall efficiency of their store network and recommend new stores that would reduce travel-related costs to WIC participants. The travel distance objective identified by ITCA WIC for urban and non-urban areas (as designated by the US Census 2010) was one and five miles, respectively.

Using these service area objectives, ITCA WIC found that in 2014, the store network served 39% and 66% of urban and non-urban clients, respectively. With the strategic addition of eight new authorized stores in 2016, the service area improved to 41% and 74% for urban and non-urban areas, respectively. Overall travel time was reduced by 15 minutes for WIC participants who lived more than 10 miles from the nearest store.

The study, “A Spatial Evaluation of Healthy Food Access: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants,” mapped 11,000 ITCA WIC participants from 2014, and 12,000 ITCA WIC participants from 2016, with authorized stores and nearby potential stores. The study was published in September 2019 in a special supplement issue of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice (JPHMP), highlighting the work of Tribal Epidemiology Centers.

Dr. Ritchey, ITCA Tribal Epidemiology Center (TEC) Director noted that, “In public health practice, we know that access to healthy food is largely reliant on built environments where individuals work, live, and spend leisure time. The inability to access healthy foods can lead to adverse childhood health consequences, including obesity and nutrient deficiencies, and increased the risk of chronic diseases later in life.”

“The ITCA WIC program is instrumental in supporting clients with access to breastfeeding support, improved household food security status, and children within WIC programs have been shown to have higher academic achievement than low income children not in the WIC program,” says ITCA Assistant Director, Travis Lane. “Our ITCA program serves both Tribal and non-Tribal members in Arizona in an effort to improve health for all.”

“Seeing where our participants are located in relation to our current authorized stores is a considerable asset in identifying areas for improvement within our service areas,” said Jonathan Davis, GIS Analyst for ITCA TEC. “By repeating this analysis, we can see if our clients are moving and can adjust our service network to continue to best meet their needs.”

Dr. Pijawka, Arizona State University, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning Professor added, “Geospatial analysis provides critical decision support and insight, which allows us to see the impact a single store has on the whole service network. Even if a potential store doesn’t improve the service area, we can see if it can reduce the travel burden for our participants.”

Mindy Jossefides, ITCA WIC Director, noted that “This work shows us that we are successful in meeting the vast majority of WIC clients’ shopping needs, while challenging us to work to improve access to stores, which will ultimately improve their nutrient intake and health.”

Mallory Phelps, ITCA WIC Vendor Manager, related that “This study has greatly assisted our program in maximizing our resources to strategically serve our communities.”

This evaluation framework uses secondary data, and is a cost-effective method to evaluate WIC participant access to stores with healthy food. Authorizing additional stores for WIC improves overall population access to healthy foods beyond those that are WIC eligible. This is particularly important in remote and rural areas where stores may be less inclined to serve a variety of fresh produce and dairy products if they were not required to do so in order to comply with WIC requirements. Authorizing only needed stores ensures that WIC state agency resources are utilized effectively and efficiently. Reducing travel distances and travel times for WIC participants reduces stress and commuting expenses that can be used for other important items.

The 120 Morgan Ave. location offers nutritious food, professional clothing, toiletries and other basic items free of charge to MSU students. Students only need to present their current MSU I.D. to access these resources.

Regular operating hours are 1-6 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.

“Bully’s Closet and Pantry really speaks to who we are at Mississippi State,” said MSU President Mark E. Keenum. “As Bulldogs, we look out for, care for and love one another. That’s what makes this university so special. I thank all who have had a role in making this wonderful facility a reality for our students.”

MSU Vice President for Student Affairs Regina Young Hyatt thanked multiple campus and community organizations for contributing their time, energy and resources to this “wonderful gift for our students.”

“When I mentioned the idea of a food pantry to President Keenum, he had a few simple words for me—make it happen. From idea to reality, it took a lot of hands,” she said. “We are grateful for our student body leaders and university partners, including our colleagues in the food science, nutrition and health promotion department who are conducting research here at Mississippi State, so we can understand more about food insecurity.”

Hyatt recognized external university partners United Way of Central Mississippi and Extra Table, both providing pantry food every month. She also expressed particular appreciation for Montelleo Hobley, behavioral intervention team coordinator in the MSU Dean of Students’ Office, whose “leadership and countless hours organizing, promoting, stocking and cleaning helped make Bully’s Closet and Pantry come to life.”

73,73,"Sep 15, 2020",Civil Eats,Connecting Fishermen with Hungry Communities Can also Benefit Local Food Systems,"While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw. Tribal members were living in campers and RVs with no electricity and a single hose for running water. Meant to be temporary, these “in-lieu fishing communities” were created in the 1950s when the federal government-built dams that forced tribal members to leave their ancestral fishing grounds.

It was like “being in a homeless shelter, without the infrastructure,” said Rodrigo, who is part Mohawk, a member of the Native American Committee of the American Bar Association, and legal and operations director for We Do Better Relief.

Rodrigo was handing out food boxes as part of a pandemic relief effort led by a new Pacific Northwest coalition called The Wave. Efforts started earlier that day at an event in Cascade Locks, Oregon, in collaboration with the Columbia River Inter-tribal Fish Commission and other groups, before moving out to the in-lieu fishing communities. The event focused on tribal members but was open to the public.

Rodrigo brought 850 pounds of fresh-frozen Alaskan lingcod, a type of groundfish, to provide alongside U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Boxes provided by the Oregon Food Bank. The Wave also provided a food truck, KOi Fusion, that served 400 free teriyaki fish rice bowls, cooked with more of the lingcod.

A partnership with the community-supported fishery (CSF) Alaskans Own, the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, and the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association, the Wave’s fish donation program involves a slew of Northwest food security groups, tribal organizations, chefs, food trucks, and seafood groups. The groups received funding from a nonprofit accelerator group, Multiplier, to purchase 130,000 pounds of fish from small boat, Alaskan fishermen to provide to food-insecure communities in Washington and Oregon.

While the program focuses on rural, and/or predominantly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), communities, it’s recently pivoted to feeding firefighters and evacuees as deadly wildfires sweep Oregon. Getting seafood—or, truly, any fresh and healthy food—to communities like those in-lieu settlements in Oregon and Washington poses additional challenges, but those are precisely what these partners aim to solve.

The partnership is one of six U.S. fish donation programs funded by Multiplier through its Catch Together program, which supports community-based fishermen. At its core, Catch Together’s grant program aims to provide fishermen a living wage to help feed food insecure families a highly nutritious, lean protein—locally caught seafood—that is rarely, if ever, included in food relief efforts.

“My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

But the fishermen groups it supports, from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, view the program as a bigger opportunity to reconnect local fishermen with their communities, at a time when many feel disconnected by global markets that whisk their catch from the dock to far-flung corners of the world. And they seek to leverage the grant funds to overcome barriers that have made it difficult to integrate their sustainably harvested catch into local and regional food systems.

“All of these different organizations and fishermen, they’re really getting excited about . . . how do we get a little bit closer to the people we’re feeding, and how do we support our communities,” said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, one of the grantees. “My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

Shoring Up Fishing Communities

Prices paid fishermen have plummeted everywhere during the pandemic as restaurants have closed or scaled back services. Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, for example, is selling for half the price fishermen were paid in 2019, according to Elizabeth Herendeen of Alaskans Own.

The Catch Together funding allows the groups to buy sustainably harvested fish and pay fishermen a stable price to keep them fishing at a time when one in eight households don’t have enough food to eat. In some cases, as with the lingcod fishermen in Alaska, the grant funds have tipped the balance: Without that funding, the fishermen wouldn’t have been able to go out fishing.

Catch Together encourages its grantees to use its funding as seed money to help them achieve longer term goals to shore up their resiliency—such as by creating a sustainable value-added product, like a fish cake or fish soup, that they can eventually market or get the USDA to purchase for one of its national food assistance programs.

“Our hope is that they’re able to use our grants to create a runway to a sustainable product, or think through how they can serve underserved parts of the community,” Paul Parker, Catch Together’s managing partner and president, told Civil Eats.

Describing Catch Together as a “hub in the middle,” Parker said it’s “uplifting to watch all the different fishing communities come up with ideas about how to serve this need, and then building the programming and cross-pollinating to one another.”

Figuring out the food donation piece can be challenging, however. First the groups need to select the species and harvest the fish, which isn’t always easy. Then they need to turn the fish into a product that’s readily usable by food assistance programs, which can also be tricky: Some programs don’t want seafood because their clients aren’t accustomed to eating it. Last, they need to work out the logistics of the distribution.

“Most of the organizations of fishermen we’re working with have deep experience in one or two of those areas, but not all three,” said Parker.

That’s why Alaskans Own and the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, which received a grant to harvest lingcod and sablefish, teamed up with the Wave, said Herendeen. “We knew the Wave had the structure in place to help move the fish to families in need.”

Reaching In-Lieu Fishing Communities

The Wave program aims to feed more than 600,000 people in rural and BIPOC communities through early November with a combination of hot meals and fresh-frozen fillets, and it piggybacks off the efforts of other food relief organizations. That means “things change on the daily,” notes Keri Johns, a manager at The Wave.","While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw.

74,74,"Aug 14, 2018",The Hechinger Report,"At more than 25 percent, Mississippi’s food hardship rate highest in nation","In a 12-month period in 2016-17, more than one of every four Mississippi households with children — 25.8 percent — lacked enough money to buy the food they needed, according to a new report by the Food Research & Action Center. That rate is the highest of any state in the nation, and over 7 percentage points higher than the 2017 national average.

At 19.7 percent, Mississippi’s food hardship rate for households without children is the second highest in the nation; only Louisiana, at 19.8 percent, has a higher rate.

The Jackson metropolitan area ranked fourth out of 108 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, with more than 21 percent of households reporting an inability to afford enough food. That rate is nearly the same as the 20.8 percent of people who live in poverty state-wide.

Research shows that when children lack access to food, they are more likely to have poor health, lag developmentally, exhibit negative behavior, and suffer anxiety or depression. These negative effects can, in turn, lead to poor academic performance.

Mississippi’s overall food shortage rate has dropped since 2008 when it hit a high of over 27 percent for all households. Nationwide, the rate of food hardship has dropped from nearly 18 percent in 2008 to just over 15 percent in 2016. The southeast and southwest regions experienced the highest rates of food shortage between 2008 and 2017.

Mississippi not only has the nation’s highest food hardship rate, it also struggles to provide summer and afterschool meals to kids who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch during the school year.

To improve access to food, the authors of the food hardship report say more jobs and higher wages are essential, as well as improved government income-support programs for struggling families. The authors encourage states, local governments and nonprofits to collaborate to enroll more families in federal nutrition programs.","At 19.7 percent, Mississippi’s food hardship rate for households without children is the second highest in the nation; only Louisiana, at 19.8 percent, has a higher rate.

75,75,"Nov 30, 2019",NBC News,Trump administration proposals could cause millions to lose food stamps,"Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

Over the past year, the Department of Agriculture proposed three changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. The new rules create stricter work requirements for program eligibility, cap deductions for utility allowances and “reform” the way 40 states automatically enroll families into SNAP when they receive other forms of federal aid.

A study by the Urban Institute released this week examined the three rules in combination for the first time and found that 3.7 million fewer people would receive SNAP in an average month, 2.2 million households would see their average monthly benefits drop by $127, more than 3 million others would see an average drop of $37 per month, and 982,000 students would lose access to free or reduced lunches.

“What we found is that overall the three proposed changes would reduce the number of households participating in SNAP by about 11 percent if this was implemented in 2018,"" said Laura Wheaton, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who conducted the study. ""It’s about a 9.4 percent reduction in the number of people participating and about an 8 percent reduction in overall benefits.”

Critics and experts say that would be antithetical to the program's goals to address food insecurity in the United States.

Craig Gundersen, an agricultural and consumer economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has studied the program for more than two decades, said that about a million people could become food-insecure because of the change. He added that 50 percent of those 3.7 million SNAP beneficiaries were already food insecure despite the assistance.

The changes, he said, would put many Americans in a worse position, increasing hunger and health issues. Each additional adult who becomes food-insecure sees an additional $2,000 in healthcare costs, Gundersen explained.

""The essential goal of the program is to mitigate hunger and its consequences in the United States,” he said. ""Anything that impedes SNAP of doing that is very problematic as it leads to food insecurity in our country.""

The USDA, meanwhile, estimates that the changes would reduce the SNAP budget by about $4.2 billion.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the work requirements in a USA Today column, emphasizing that it would save taxpayer dollars.

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

“At USDA, our informal motto is ‘Do Right and Feed Everyone,’” Perdue wrote. “With these proposed improvements, we will ‘do right’ by the taxpayers and restore the dignity of work to the able-bodied who receive SNAP benefits. And, we will ‘feed everyone’ by ensuring the health and stability of SNAP for those who truly need it.”

All of the new rules have gone through a comment period with the changes to utilities currently taking feedback until Monday. Tens of thousands of people have already responded, with most providing negative responses.

The latest rule change proposed by the Trump administration would cause millions of people to take smaller deductions for shelter and utility costs, which are considered when a person applies for SNAP benefits. Critics say that would force people to choose between buying food and paying for housing.

Gundersen said this change will prove to be a major cost for those living in metropolitan areas with high living costs.

It could also create a steeper financial cliff for some beneficiaries. Those in danger of losing access to SNAP might be discouraged from working because the new calculation would put them in a higher income bracket, causing them to lose access, Gundersen explained

“On the one hand they want to encourage people to work, but on the other they would be taking away that incentive,” Gundersen said.

But the main issue is that SNAP is not intended to be a work program in the first place, Gundersen said, but is instead intended to address food insecurity within the United States.

As it operates now, SNAP does not discourage people from participating in the labor market, he said.

""There are some assistance programs that do discourage people to work, but this is not one of them,"" Gundersen said, adding that what lawmakers should be asking is: ""What makes this program work so well and why does it work well as compared to other programs?""

These new rules also have advocates in states like Nevada worried. Nevada could see up to 22 percent of recipients lose access to food stamps, which could be devastating in a place where 12.3 percent of households face food insecurity, according to the USDA.

“SNAP is related to hunger and getting people the nutrition they need,” said Jocelyn Lantrip, the communications director at Food Bank of Northern Nevada. “Food shouldn’t be a luxury.”

With a tech boom raising income levels but not enough to cover rising housing costs, Lantrip said that these changes could create further food insecurity issues, which remain close to the levels that the Food Bank of Northern Nevada saw during the recession.

At the height of the recession, Lantrip said her food bank helped 103,000 people per month. Now, during a period of perceived economic stability, she said they are helping 91,000.

Food banks like hers wouldn’t be able to accommodate for the needs of an additional 196,000 people, which is the number in Nevada who would likely need help accessing food if these rules were to go into effect, Lantrip said.

“That’s really hard for food banks to keep up with if you have that kind of decline in benefits,” she said. “We support people if they fall outside of the safety net, but we can’t replace the safety net as a food bank. We’re spinning our wheels already, because when unemployment is low people assume hunger is low, but we’re just helping more working poor than before.”","Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

""Within that area, only about 5 percent of those grocery stores supply locally-sourced produce, he said. ""There's about 20 grocery stores in the city. That's about one for every 10,000 people.""

When it comes to assessing a location as food insecure or not, Bartlett said there are a number of factors that come into play.

""It really has a situation of numbers of people, grocery stores, and the amount of fresh produce and nutritious foods that are available in a particular populous. Really, within a food desert only about maybe 23 percent or so of the people have access to fresh produce,"" he added.

Dole decided to first introduce its #SunshingForAll campaign to Jackson due to the city's lack of accessible public transportation, a surplus of fast food establishments, and a median income of just over $35,000, Bartlett said.

While many communities are impacted by a lack of adequate access to healthier food options, Dole is leaning on the public to help the company decide which locations should be next. Bartlett said all people have to do is log on to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter and explain to the company why their location qualifies as a food desert while using the tag #SunshineForAll.

The state of Mississippi has long ranked at the bottom when it comes to obesity, with data suggesting that nearly 75 percent of residents in the Magnolia State are overweight.But not everyone is getting a seat at the table.

78,78,"Jun 10, 2020",Business Insider,Millions of kids go hungry in the US every summer without school lunches. These striking facts reveal the scale of the problem.,"In the US, 22 million kids get free or reduced-price lunch during the school year.

These school-lunch programs are an important source of food for many children.

But during summer vacation, only 16% of kids who need USDA-funded summer meals are able to access them.

This makes summer the hungriest time of year for lots of children, and it can have long-term consequences.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In the United States, over 11 million children live in food-insecure homes. That term refers to households in which there isn't enough food available for everyone in the family to lead a healthy life, according to national campaign No Kid Hungry.

To support these families, several federal nutrition programs provide assistance: 22 million children rely on free or reduced-price lunch at school, which is funded by the National School Lunch Program.

However, when summer comes around, these meals are often no longer available, which means millions of children don't get fed as they usually would. The USDA and many nonprofits are trying to fill that gap, but the problem hasn't yet been alleviated. School closures due to the coronavirus pandemic put even more children at risk of going hungry.

Here's a glimpse at what happens each summer in the US.

Summer can be the hungriest time of year for kids

Millions of children in the US suffer from hunger and food anxiety during the summer months, since they rely on free or reduced-price meals during the school year.

To address this, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds the Summer Food Service Program, which enables community leaders to establish summer meal delivery sites around the country. Child nutrition programs received an additional $8.8 billion of federal funding this summer to address the pandemic's impact on access to free meals.

However, meals from the summer meals programs only reach only 16% of the children who might need it, according to No Kid Hungry.

One reason for this lack of participation in summer-meals programs is that many families simply aren't aware they exist or don't know how to access them.

Access to summer meals is limited by transportation issues, weather, and other factors

The Summer Food Service Program normally requires children to eat their summer meals on site at the location they're distributed. During the school year, many children rely on school buses for transportation. Without them, it can be difficult for kids to get to summer-meal sites, especially if their parents are working all day.

The requirement to eat summer meals in a group setting has been waived for the summer of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, more meals are being delivered to individual homes. Restrictions around meal deliveries have also been waived.

But about 30% of children who are eligible for free summer meals live in communities that aren't eligible to host meal sites. The program stipulates that summer-meal sites can only be established in areas where at least 50% of children are eligible for free and reduced-price lunches. But poverty exists in economically diverse communities, of course.

There are additional issues that block children in need from accessing nutritious meals. Severe weather can prevent some kids from getting to summer meal sites. Many communities in the US experience dangerously high temperatures, thunderstorms, and other severe weather patterns that can make it difficult for children to get to the sites where meals are served. Some sites are located outdoors, so are particularly affected by weather.

Yet another challenge is that summer-meals programs are temporary in nature, so the sites and all the logistical aspects of running them must be reestablished every summer then dismantled at the start of the school year. This means that sites must re-submit applications every year, renew licenses, recruit staff members, and more. For organizations that have limited resources or small budgets, this can be quite challenging.

The end result of these challenges, according to the nonprofit Children Incorporated, is that there are only 36 summer food programs for every 100 school lunch programs.

Summer hunger can have long-term consequences for health and learning

During summer, families generally have to buy more food than normal because their children spend more time at home. This can strain families' budgets: 43% of low-income families say it's harder to make ends meet in the summer.

On average, a household's grocery costs rise more than $300 a month when school is out, according to No Kid Hungry.

Children who suffer from summer hunger can face more health challenges than their more affluent peers. For instance, many children from low-income families turn to inexpensive, calorie-dense foods during the summer, but those meals lack nutritional value. According to No Kid Hungry, many children who go without school meals during the summer gain weight two to three times faster than their peers during those months. This can lead to higher healthcare expenses for children experiencing obesity.

Additionally, children living in food-insecure homes are more susceptible to chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes , asthma, and heart disease .

Hungry children also are more likely to experience a ""summer slide,"" according to No Kid Hungry. This is when kids forget what they learned during the school year. Over the course of several years, this learning loss can add up and contribute to a significant achievement gap between children from low-income families and children from higher-income families.

Research suggests that as much as 80% of the gap in reading achievement between these groups of students may be attributed to the summer slide.","But during summer vacation, only 16% of kids who need USDA-funded summer meals are able to access them.

79,79,"Dec 21, 2020",The Counter,Hunger and food insecurity are not the same. Here’s why that matters—and what they mean.,"For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

But that number actually represented the lowest rates of food insecurity in nearly a decade. The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic.

A snapshot assessment led by the U.S. Census Bureau and designed to offer less-comprehensive but more immediate information on the social and economic impacts of Covid, showed that, as recently as the period between November 25 and December 7 (including Thanksgiving), some 27 million adults—13 percent of all adults in the country—reported their household sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat.","For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak.
The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic."
80,80,"Nov 5, 2020",BetaBoston,Study: A million people in Mass. don’t have enough food,"Massachusetts has seen the highest percent increase of residents facing food insecurity of all states, according to new projections released by Feeding America last Friday. The hunger rate in the state has increased 59 percent since 2018, representing more than 1 million people who are now struggling to get enough to eat. The child food-insecurity rate has also worsened, with one in five children in Massachusetts now living in food-insecure households, a 102 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 levels. (Norfolk County in Massachusetts has the highest percent change in child food-insecurity in the country, with a 163 percent increase in 2020 versus 2018.)

As the country awaits the returns of the presidential election and any prospects of another economic stimulus bill, one thing has remained consistent amid the pandemic: People in Massachusetts are going hungry. And the problem is only growing.

The overall food insecurity rate in Massachusetts is projected to reach 14.2 percent this year. The highest rates in the United States will be in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, which could each have more than 20 percent of their citizens facing hunger. And California is predicted to have 6.2 million people who are having trouble getting enough to eat, the largest total number of any state in the country.

“The need isn’t going anywhere,” said Catherine Drennan, the director of public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, which served over 600,000 people in September, a 120 percent increase over last year.

November and December are typically some of the busiest months for local food banks, but the combined economic, political, and public health crises facing the Commonwealth will make this year unlike any other, said Drennan. She said the food bank is planning to provide 20 million meals as part of its annual Hunger Free Holidays campaign.

New issues with a federal food-distribution program have stoked anxieties further among local organizations working to provide food to those in need. Back in May, as part of the CARES Act, the USDA launched its $4.5 billion Farmers to Families Food Box program, working with US farmers to purchase and distribute boxes of agricultural products. During the first three rounds of the program, several vendors in New England were awarded eight-week contracts, and each built a network of local distributors to hand out hundreds of thousands of prepacked boxes filled with dairy, meat, and produce.

Many of the boxes ended up being distributed to local nonprofits — like the Brazilian Workers Center in Allston — which are operating outside the established regional food bank networks, having launched or expanded emergency food services as they saw the need in their communities.

“Since COVID-19, we’ve had to repurpose our regular services to meet food insecurity in the community,” said the Brazilian Workers Center’s executive director, Natalicia Tracy. “The Boston food banks weren’t equipped to handle the demand, and we saw a huge increase in need for food in Allston. So the USDA boxes were really critical.” The Brazilian Workers Center now feeds 500 families each week.

But the execution of the food box program has been fraught. Farmers who won contracts and planted crops for the program were left high and dry when they weren’t chosen as vendors in subsequent rounds. In some parts of the country, there were concerns about the nutritional value of the goods included in the boxes. The USDA also faced blowback last month after President Trump required that a signed letter from him be included in each box.

In the agency’s latest funding round announced last Friday, no Massachusetts vendors were awarded contracts. This will likely mean significant delays in getting the next round of local food distributions up and running, leaving partner organizations like Tracy’s scrambling to find sources for food as they head toward Thanksgiving. So earlier this week, she headed back to the store. “We’ve already purchased 1,200 pounds of rice, beans, and pasta, and some produce. We’re still trying to figure out whatever we can get our hands on,” she said.

Those who have been working with the USDA say that the changes will put undue pressure on the Massachusetts food bank system during its busiest season.

“In two weeks these pantries are going to burn through whatever dry goods they have in back stock,"" said Sean Buchanan, the vice president of sales at Costa Fruit and Produce, one of the local distributors whose vendor contract with the USDA was not renewed. He said Costa handed out more than 889,000 food boxes to 400 partners since the program launched, only to have to turn off the faucet for the distributions on Monday.

“It’s a perfect storm for food insecurity,"" he said.

The USDA’s decision also forced produce distributor Katsiroubas Bros. to lay off 40 staff members overnight, said Torry Katsiroubas Stamm, the company’s president. Over the past several months, the Boston-based distributor had set up an elaborate supply chain and partnered with the nonprofit Boston Area Gleaners to deliver more than 10 million pounds of food to nonprofits, public housing sites, and food banks throughout New England, she said. The program has helped keep her business afloat as her restaurant and food service accounts have cut back on orders amid the pandemic.

Now, that supply chain has been upended, and a new company in Long Island, N.Y., has been given the contract and has to start over creating a distribution plan from scratch, she said.

“Our partners have been calling us, and we don’t have anything to tell them,” Katsiroubas said. “They’re panicked."" She said she feels the same level of stress she heard from her customers back in March, “with everyone saying ‘What do we do?' We’re still here, it feels like it’s happening again.”

“Before this program got up and running, we saw a lot of nonprofits that had never moved food or dealt with food moving thousands of boxes or grocery bags a week,” said Dylan Frazier, the director of strategy for the Boston Area Gleaners, which worked as both a vendor and partner with local distributors to make USDA food box deliveries. “We’re telling people you have to call the food bank, we don’t have any food for you,” he said. “People are flipping out. It’s panic mode. There’s still a line of a thousand or two thousand people with no food.”

Food pantry lines have already been getting longer over the past several months at the Salvation Army of Chelsea and East Boston, said Captain Isael Gonzalez, who oversees the emergency food program there. So, having to wait for the USDA program to restart with new vendors from out of state means he’s now struggling to serve the 700 families that seek out his services daily.

“Through the USDA program, we’ve been distributing over 2,100 boxes each week to families out of our office, and the good part is the boxes come prepacked, and there’s no labor on our end,” Gonzales said. “Not having those boxes is going to have a huge impact: It’s more trips to the Greater Boston Food Bank, more relying on local donations from different resources, and a lot of labor intensity on our part too.”

Ultimately, the USDA Food Box program provides just a small percentage of the overall food assistance currently in place in the region. But “we’ll take every food source we can and it’s definitely helpful,” Drennan, of the Greater Boston Food Bank, said. More importantly, she added, the program is set to expire by year’s end, and “unless another stimulus package comes out and they decide to renew, I don’t know what will happen.”

81,81,"Jan 31, 2019",Mississippi Today,"Clarksdale ‘brought home the bacon,’ and landed a new grocer seen as vital to the Delta town’s economy","CLARKSDALE – Like many rural Delta towns, this community of 16,000 battles with poverty related issues and limited access to fresh high quality foods is a top concern for many. Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

But, now city officials have announced a new grocer will come into the city, bringing healthy, fresh eats to the residents and neighboring counties.

“Last year, if you all remember, we were pulling out our handkerchiefs and saying goodbye to a grocery store player that had been here for decades, and many of us felt that loss,” said Jon Levingston, executive director of the Clarksdale/Coahoma County Chamber of Commerce.

“Today, we got the promise of a new wonderful grocery store, a new choice to buy quality food for our citizens here in Clarksdale. … Every community that is economically and financially sustainable has choices — choices in housing, choices in grocery stores, good jobs … and this is one more piece in an economic puzzle that allows us to create a sustainable, financial platform for Clarksdale.”

Over the past year, citizens feared the town would not secure another grocery store after the departure of Kroger, a primary option for residents. Many were in disbelief upon hearing news of its closing. Kroger officials cited that profits were declining at the Clarksdale store.

But the Kroger here was profitable, said Mayor Chuck Espy, adding that their year-end balance sheet indicated the store produced $17 million in revenue. Rather it was the corporation changing “their business model to depart from rural communities that look like Clarksdale or Third Street in Memphis,” that resulted in store shutting its doors, he said.

“(Places) where there were people who didn’t have a large discretionary dollar, where there was poverty or high minority population, they pulled out of those communities,” said Espy. “I understand from a corporate aspect, they’re looking for higher profit margin … but pulling out of areas that is designated as a food desert is devastating to a community.”

Clarksdale wasn’t the only town to lose its Kroger. Two other stores in Memphis closed. And a host of other Kroger locations have closed within the past year, several media outlets reported.

The closing here has had an economic impact on the city. Sales taxes have plummeted. In just the past four months, sales tax revenue was down $54,000, said Cathy Clark, Clarksdale city clerk. Online shopping and the loss of Kroger are the two primary factors, officials say.

Last year alone, sale tax revenue was down $125,000. But despite the decrease in revenue and declining population, Clarksdale leaders see new developments like Piggly Wiggly, as a way to grow the community, create more jobs, and bring in more revenue.

Dwan “Dee” Brown, economic developer of P3 Group, Inc., announced the building of the new Piggly Wiggly that will create about 75 jobs, at the mayor and board of commissioners January meeting.

Instead of moving into the old Kroger building, Brown, who’s spearheading the $39 million Corey L. Moore Sports and Recreational Complex in Clarksdale, said that Piggly Wiggly will be located at the complex site.

“As mayor, I’ve been in negotiations with three other entities to take over Kroger. Every entity thought the footprint was too large of a grocery chain,” said Espy in a phone call with Mississippi Today. “(Grocery chains are) moving away from big box stores and moving to smaller intimate stores.”

Brown echoed the mayor, adding that after conducting a market study, the results indicated that equipment, such as HVAC systems and coolers, in the former Kroger dated back to 1981 and the newest in 2001. It would be more costly to move out the old equipment, bring in new equipment, upgrade electrical work, among other things, he said.

The closest Piggly Wiggly to Clarksdale is about 38 miles north in Batesville. But unlike other Piggly Wiggly supermarkets, this one will be tailored specifically to Clarksdale’s culture: focusing on the blues.

“The new store will basically be a blues city Piggly Wiggly. It’ll be more than a shopping experience, it’ll be a cultural experience for those who come and visit,” said Brown. “It’ll be designed to capture the culture and heritage of Clarksdale.”

Blues music will not only reach customers ears when they walk in, but the interior design will reflect the blues culture, said Brown.

Aside from the grocery store, other amenities include a fuel center, a loyalty program to tie rewards from shopping to fuel purchases, curbside pickup for groceries, and delivery services to retirement homes and Coahoma Community College students. Brown noted that CCC students can apply for work study jobs at Piggly Wiggly that will be subsidized by the operations, which means revenue from the store will provide additional funds for students to have work study jobs.

Building the store will cost around $4 million and the fuel center will cost around $500,000, said Brown. They are looking to secure new market tax credits for the project. The sports complex along with the Piggly Wiggly will start the building phase in tandem.

If the process goes as planned, Brown said he hopes to break ground on the public infrastructure in May, construct buildings in August, and open around January or February in 2020.

“We have looked at this area for quite some time, and we know that there’s a need for a grocery store here in this area where you don’t have to go out of town and spend three hours round trip out of your day,” said Tim Chaffin, sales manager of Piggly Wiggly in Alabama at the meeting.

“Piggly Wiggly is not a cookie cutter concept. You can’t drop this store in Nashville, Tenn., or Atlanta, Ga., and it have the same feel. …This is an original.”

Chaffin said that a project of this magnitude is not as easy as putting something on a shelf. He said there is a preliminary site plan in place, but this is time consuming due to putting infrastructure in place and building the store.

Piggly Wiggly is a grocery wholesaler who partners with independent owners, operators, and economic developers. This particular store is a partnership between Brown, his partners CORE Construction and Chasm Architecture, and Piggly Wiggly representatives.

Like this rural town, there have been other communities seeking grocery store options. Another small town in Mississippi, Gloster, struggled with getting one for decades. Finally, they were able to bring a Piggly Wiggly to their town.

The issue of limited access to grocery stores is all too common in rural areas across the state. Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Coahoma County, where Clarksdale is located, has one of the highest food insecurity rates in the state at 31 percent, eleven percent above the state average, according to data from Feeding America.

Though many citizens here were ecstatic about a new grocery store coming in, others questioned the location of the store via social media. A Mississippi Today reporter announcement of the store on Facebook, received 120 shares, 96 comments, and 176 reactions.

Residents argued it would be a hassle to get to the Piggly Wiggly location. Brown noted the distance of citizens driving to Piggly Wiggly versus citizens traveling to the former Kroger store is about a mile and a half for both.

Although the announcement came Monday, officials hope to have a ribbon cutting around this time next year.

“I have to say that I can’t pass this opportunity without saying, ‘Mr. mayor, board of commissioners, Tim, Dwan, y’all have really brought home the bacon, haven’t you?” said Levingston.

“They don’t call it Piggly Wiggly for nothing.”","Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

83,83,"Sep 17, 2019",Mississippi Public Broadcasting,Farmers Markets Bring Together Communities in Mississippi Delta,"Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming. It was founded by former slaves, and agriculture was part of its history from the beginning. But by the mid-1960s, many African Americans in this part of state were starving. It was so bad that then U.S .Senator Robert F. Kennedy traveled to Mississippi to investigate. Fast forward 50 years and food insecurity is still a problem. But as MPB’s Alexandra Watts reports, there’s a program that’s trying to tackle hunger – one fresh vegetable at a time.

It’s a Saturday morning in Mound Bayou, and LeBroderick Woods is making sure everything is in order for the day for the weekly mobile market put on by Delta Fresh Foods Initiative.

“These are some sweet potatoes that are about 89 cents per pound that were picked out at the Alcorn [State University] farm this morning,” Woods, who is the market manager, points out as he walks around the market. “Here is okra that’s about a dollar and 25 cents per pound.”

Shopper Angela Henderson eyes boxes of red and green tomatoes, potatoes and okra. She’s here because her small town does not have a grocery store.

“It helps us a lot to get everything we need in one place,” Henderson said after buying okra for her meal. “It is very economical and very healthy.”

In addition to Mound Bayou, the mobile market sets up in Shelby and Winstonville on alternating weekends. The market is always parked in a central location so people can walk to it.

Woods said the nearest grocery store is nine miles and a highway away.

“It’s been a struggle. Mound Bayou is considered to be a food desert because they’re so far away from your nearest Walmart – you have to go to Clarksdale or Cleveland, and if you don’t have transportation, that can be a big issue,” Woods said. “One of the hugest parts is transportation and getting to the locally grown food or fresh food.”

The options close by are not the healthiest options.

“[There are] no stores. We have a Bob's Express that sells fried chicken. But nobody around here in the Mound Bayou area sells fresh produce,” Tanielle Woods explains.

Woods is a college sophomore and youth ambassador with the market. Today, she is one of three youth ambassadors at the market.

Listen to Tannielle Woods on healthy eating:

“My name is Tanielle Woods, I am a sophomore at Mississippi Delta Community College and my major is physical therapy. I’m young and in college and I thought that maybe eating noodles and fried chicken was okay, but eating healthy is not bad.”

The youth ambassadors help grow the food and work in the market. As Woods describes it, they are there from “seed to consumer.”

“They'll bring the price down [on] the unhealthy things and the healthy things we have to pay an arm and a leg for,” said Samuel Ferguson, another youth ambassador. The market accepts cash, card and SNAP benefits.

“I think it's important for every community to have fresh produce and have it for cheap, affordable prices, so we can get it.”

Price and transportation concerns went into how the market runs. Before starting the market, Delta Fresh Foods Initiative surveyed community members to see what they wanted.

Rachael Carter of Mississippi State University said community engagement offers more to rural markets.

“In rural communities when they don't have those options of grocery stores, a market can come in and set up wherever they want to have it in the community,” Carter said. “You can put it where people can walk to the market [and] provide a variety of farm produced products. That’s a wonderful thing for a community that just lost a grocery store.”

In Bolivar County, more than one in four people don’t have reliable access to quality food. In Mississippi, around 16 percent of households are food insecure – and the state ranks second in the nation. Many of the most food insecure regions are in the Mississippi Delta.

A United States Department of Agriculture study found that food insecurity is associated with ten chronic diseases. According to County Health Rankings, Bolivar County’s quality of life ranks 72 out 81 Mississippi counties.

Down the road from the market is The Delta Health Center, which opened in the mid 1960s and was one of the first of its kind in the country. According to Out in the Rural: A Health Center in Mississippi and its War on Poverty by Thomas J. Ward Jr., current issues like transportation and health were prevalent in Bolivar County and the Delta years ago.

David Holben, a professor and director of Food and Nutrition Studies at the University of Mississippi, said these health issues still exist.

“I think people equate the health problems we have in our state and nation to over-nutrition and access to too much food,” Holben said. “When in reality, it might be [that] we have access to high fat and high sugar food that tastes good, and yet are lacking nutrients.”



But Holben said having farmers markets can benefit communities.

“So farmers markets do definitely increase access to healthy food available in rural communities,” Holben said. “They do play a crucial role in people having access to fresh and healthy food in their local area. We’re really talking about a local food system.”

“When farmers markets are in communities and people are using it, there is a health benefit in terms of improved diet,” Darcy Freedman of Case Western Reserve University said. But she also notes farmers markets is not a sole health solution.

“It’s going to be a compilation of many factors that are overall making healthy foods more affordable [and] making them more available in addition to other things like promoting walkability and economic opportunity.”

Back at the market, Henry Herman stands near a red wheelbarrow loaded with green watermelon. Herman had a stroke a few years ago, and said he’s learned about the importance of healthy eating.

“If you get healthy food like it was back in the day, I guarantee there would be a lot less people dying or having health problems,” Herman said.

Larry Haywood also stops by the market. He’s a local grower who is helping the youth ambassadors growing the food.

He, too, has had health issues and says there is a power in eating better.

“You don’t realize that until you start eating healthier...and you realize how to eat to live rather than live to eat,” Haywood said.

LeBroderick Woods on what a ""Good Food Revolution"" Means:



""Because it’s a change. It’s a paradigm change -- it’s a paradigm change for the community. We’ve gotten so stuck on instant gratification – your Big Macs, your quick meals and things of that nature. We’ve kind of gotten away from things we were raised on – the fresh produce and grandmama’s cooking and things of that nature. So good food is not just good tasting, it’s good for the spirit. It’s good overall. It build character even if you will.""

Right now, the market is only in Mound Bayou once every three weeks, but LeBroderick Woods wants to see it expand.

“I hope it grows to us having our own market here, and it being a consistent thing throughout the week -- not just a Saturday event,” says Woods, who comes back every week to his hometown. That it’s something that can be prominent and it lasts through seasons – summer, winter, fall all of the above. That it’s our own Walmart or grocery store here in Mound Bayou.”

Delta Fresh Foods Initiative hopes customers walk away with more than just fresh produce. The organization wants them to learn how to live and eat healthier.","Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming.

84,84,"May 20, 2020",PRNewswire,Feeding America Study Projects Local Food Insecurity Rates Amid Pandemic Could Reach Up To 1 In 3 Adults And 1 In 2 Children,"CHICAGO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will have a devastating impact on people facing hunger across communities nationwide, according to a new study by Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization. This study is the first of its kind to explore how food insecurity rates at the local level may increase in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity analyzes food insecurity rates for the overall population and children by state, county and congressional district. According to the study, communities that had higher rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will continue to struggle more than other areas. Meanwhile, communities with lower rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will tend to see the largest relative increases in food insecurity as a result of the crisis.

Pre-pandemic – and according to the USDA's most recent report on food security in the U.S. – 37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life. However, a recent Feeding America analysis demonstrates that this number is likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children. That means approximately 54 million people (1 in 6 people) may experience food insecurity in 2020, including 18 million children (1 in 4 children).

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

According to The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, the states projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity among the overall population include Mississippi (24.1 percent), Arkansas (22.5 percent), Alabama (22.2 percent), Louisiana (21.7 percent) and New Mexico (20.7 percent). Meanwhile, the states projected to have the highest rates of child food insecurity include Louisiana (34.5 percent), New Mexico (33.9 percent), Nevada (32.9 percent), Mississippi (32.6 percent) and Alabama (32.4 percent). One in three children in these states will likely experience food insecurity this year.

Specific counties projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity this year are:

Jefferson County, MS (34.2 percent for overall population)

(34.2 percent for overall population) Issaquena County, MS (33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children)

(33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children) East Carrol Parish , LA (33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children)

(33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children) Kusilvak Census Area, AK (33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children)

(33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children) Holmes County, MS (32.7 percent for overall population)

(32.7 percent for overall population) Sabine County, TX (49.1 percent for children)

(49.1 percent for children) Zavala County, TX (48.9 percent for children)

Additionally, the counties that may see the highest change in food insecurity rates for the overall population are:

Burke County, ND (157 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(157 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Renville County, ND (131 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

""More of our neighbors in these communities and beyond are relying in part on charitable food assistance to make ends meet,"" said Babineaux-Fontenot. ""As a result, food banks are facing a 'perfect storm' of surges in demand, declining food donations, fewer volunteers and disruptions to our operating procedures. Regardless of these challenges, we will continue to stay strong and resilient and work our best to help ensure our neighbors have food on the table.""

This new analysis was conducted by building upon the approach Feeding America used in two earlier briefs to predict changes to national food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to changes to poverty and unemployment. The annual projected unemployment rate (11.5%) is within close range of expert estimates when annualized, including those from a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of more than 60 economists as of May (11.6%), the Congressional Budget Office (11.4%), and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (10.3%). To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national unemployment projection for job loss due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

The underlying analysis for the food insecurity projections was conducted by Dr. Craig Gundersen using the model developed for Map the Meal Gap, Feeding America's county-level food insecurity report.

Other key findings from this report regarding the overall population include:

The projected rate of food insecurity is highest for Mississippi (24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018.

In addition to North Dakota , states that are projected to have the highest change in food insecurity rates – from 2018 to 2020 – include Minnesota (60 percent change), Nevada (57 percent change), Wisconsin (57 percent change) and Hawaii (57 percent change).

Other key findings from this report regarding child food insecurity:

California will see the highest increase in the number of children living in food-insecure households (852,730) bringing the total to 2.2 million. Still, Texas will be home to the most children facing food insecurity (2.3 million).

85,85,"Oct 29, 2019",Washington Post,What parents should know about how living near fast-food outlets could affect their children,"The obesity figures dropped for every half block farther away that students lived from unhealthy food sources, the researchers found.

AD

Elbel said in a phone interview that the findings showed a new impact of “the potential role of the food environment” on public health.

Since 2007, schools in New York have tracked students’ height and weight. Elbel and his team used mapping software and the city’s restaurant inspection data to compare students’ addresses with their distance from fast-food outlets, corner stores, sit-down restaurants and grocery stores, all selling healthy food and junk food.

AD

The researchers used the inspection data to identify restaurants with counter service, including pizza, Chinese and any other kind of order-at-the-counter takeout.

The researchers were then able to correlate students’ body mass index data with precisely how close they lived to these kinds of restaurants.

AD

The comparisons made were “highly neighborhood specific,” according to the researchers. For example, youths in a small section of Harlem were compared only with other youths in the same part of Harlem.

“It really gets rid of a lot of the confounding data like socioeconomic status,” Elbel said. “We weren’t looking at Upper East Side kids versus Lower East Side kids. We were comparing kids that live in the same small neighborhood to each other. How does living close versus a little bit further away affect kids? There’s something about living within half a block to fast food that’s not great.”

The study, Elbel acknowledged, does not account for the rise of healthier counter-service eateries such as Sweetgreen, but he said that because the data was collected between 2007 and 2013, most of the eateries covered by the study were traditional fast-food restaurants leaning on hamburgers, sandwiches and such.

AD

AD

For Elbel, “food swamps,” or urban areas with a density of fast-food restaurants and corner stores stocked with unhealthy choices, present challenges.

“It’s about supply and demand, the structure of cities and historical zoning issues,” he said. “A bigger question is: What is it about access to these restaurants that’s triggering?”

The study found no increase in obesity risk based on the distance from home to grocery stores and sit-down restaurants. What appears to put youths at risk is how easily and quickly they can access junk food, Elbel said.

He said further research was needed to explore what happens when children pass fast-food outlets on the way to and from school.

AD

There has been a lot of voluntary regulation, he said, with the food industry agreeing to clamp down on advertising to children. But, Elbel said, government bears some responsibility to regulate.

AD

“Policy has been proposed that addresses the density of these kinds of restaurants,” he said. “London had considered restricting fast food around schools. We already limit liquor stores around schools and churches.”

Obesity rates for children have tripled since the 1970s, and experts say a drop of just a few percentage points could save thousands of children from diabetes, heart disease and other health problems.

According to a National Survey of Children’s Health report released this month, obesity rates among youths ages 10 to 17 averaged 15.3 percent nationwide, with a childhood obesity rate of 25.4 percent in Mississippi.

Nationwide, black and Hispanic youths had obesity rates of 22.2 percent and 19 percent respectively, significantly higher than white (11.8 percent) or Asian (7.3 percent) youths.

AD

AD

But the root causes are confounding — how to tweeze out genetic predispositions from lifestyle choices and income — and this muddies what can be done about it.

It has not been all gloomy news for children’s nutrition. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, over the past several years there has been a decline in obesity rates among some children.","The obesity figures dropped for every half block farther away that students lived from unhealthy food sources, the researchers found.

86,86,"May 1, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Drug felons can now receive food stamps in Mississippi,"CLOSE You hear it all the time, but do you know what SNAP is? Here are 6 things you should know about the program that started during the Great Depression. USA TODAY

As many as 67,000 Mississippians with felony drug convictions could become eligible for federal food assistance after the state Legislature opted out of a federal rule preventing them from receiving the benefits.

The change is part of criminal justice reforms lawmakers passed this year to try to reduce recidivism and prison population.

In 1996, Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. It disqualified people convicted of a state or federal drug felony from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families for life — unless their state legislatures opt out.

When the Mississippi Legislature passed House Bill 1352, the Criminal Justice Reform Act, this year, it opted out the federal ban on SNAP. The change becomes effective July 1.

Mississippi had been one of only three states that still had a full ban on those with a drug conviction that kept them from participating in the programs. The other two states are South Carolina and West Virginia.

Sen. Sally Doty, R-Brookhaven, successfully pushed to add the change to the reform bill.

Doty said eligible SNAP program participants must meet income requirements and either have a job or participate in workforce training or GED classes. But with the ban in place, the education and job training programs were unavailable to those with drug felonies on their records.

""I saw no reason to treat drug felons differently than those with violent offenses,"" Doty said. ""And the ban had a larger effect on women, who generally have lower-paying jobs and could greatly benefit from the education and training programs, as well as the nutritional support. The overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities.""

SNAP provides monthly benefits to help low-income households buy food. The federal program is administered by the Mississippi Department of Human Services.

Department of Human Services staff attorney Dewitt Fortenberry said the agency can’t answer with certainty how many more people will qualify because of the change.

The nonprofit Mississippi Center for Justice said as of 2017, an estimated 67,376 Mississippians who had state drug felony convictions could be affected by the federal SNAP ban at some point in their lives. Based on 2011 figures, an estimated 5,200 women statewide could be impacted by the TANF ban during their lifetimes.

The SNAP program is federally funded. Mississippi receives about $60 million a month in federal funds for the program.

There are limits on income for a family to receive SNAP benefits. The maximum monthly household income limit for a family of four is $2,665 and the maximum amount of SNAP payment would be $640 monthly.

MCJ said lifting the SNAP and TANF drug felony ban in Mississippi would significantly decrease recidivism and lift a lifetime punishment that heightens hunger, unemployment, and economic instability, especially for women and their families.

“One in five Mississippians and one in four children statewide are hungry — the highest in the nation,"" said Kathryn Rehner, an MCJ policy associate. ""Lifting the SNAP/TANF drug felony ban will help put food on the table for thousands of children and families in our state while increasing access to workforce training and helping reentering citizens find work and stability.”

MCJ said women — especially single mothers — are significantly more likely than men to participate in SNAP or TANF during their lifetimes but are also more likely to have a felony for a drug conviction. .

87,87,"Mar 24, 2020",Food Tank,"Support These 50+ Organizations Helping Restaurants, Workers, and Farmers Survive COVID-19 – Food Tank","Contributing Authors: Jared Kaufman and Elena Seeley

Editor’s note: This article will be continually updated throughout the COVID-19 outbreak and will remain in alphabetical order. Please email elena@foodtank.com if you would like to add an opportunity to our running list.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus, has disrupted most of the world in recent weeks. People are staying home from work, schools and colleges are moving online, and restaurants in many cities and states are mandated to serve eaters via takeout or delivery only. Farmers markets are closing or not opening at all. And, unfortunately, some cafes, bars, and kitchens have closed entirely. Food service workers—from chefs and line cooks to wait staff and dishwashers—are on the front lines of both the health and economic impacts of this disease.

But thankfully, in response, advocates around the country and around the world are gathering community support—and if you’re able, you can help too. These organizations are welcoming donations of food, money, and volunteer hours to aid restaurants, service workers, farmers, and people going hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. ALONE Ireland

With people self-isolating to prevent COVID-19 infections, senior citizens—already particularly vulnerable to the disease—may feel lonelier with limited social contact. ALONE is an Irish organization that recruits volunteers to call, visit, and befriend elderly people living at home. In response to COVID-19, they are looking for more volunteers to offer telephone support, by kindly checking in on those over 60, and practical support, by running errands like grocery shopping and pharmacy pickups. They have also launched a national helpline to answer questions and offer reassurance. People around the world are welcome to donate, and those living in Ireland can volunteer here.

2. ATL Family Meal

As a collaboration of more than 200 restaurants and businesses in the Atlanta area, ATL Family Meal delivers meals to hospitality workers who are facing either unemployment or hunger due to COVID-19. ATL Family Meal has delivered more than 15,000 meals during the pandemic. The initiative’s meal delivery network includes Butcher & Brew, Holeman & Finch, Empire State South, and more. Plus, Wild Heaven Beer, a local craft beer brewery, has created two new beers to support ATL Family Meal and is donating a portion of proceeds to the initiative.

3. Big Table

Operating in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and San Diego, California, Big Table cares for restaurant workers experiencing hardship, poverty, addiction, legal trouble, and more—all of which can be magnified by crises like COVID-19. Big Table works on a referral model, so rather than requiring a person in crisis to ask, Big Table allows a fellow employee or manager to submit a personal referral. You can donate online, or care for vulnerable members of your own community by taking on one of Big Table’s creative support ideas. If you are a food service worker and know someone in crisis, refer them here.

4. Boston Cares

A central hub for volunteering, Boston Cares helps more than 25,000 people annually give back to schools, nonprofit agencies, and other community programs. They recruit, train, and mobilize volunteers across the Greater Boston area. As many civic organizations adjust their programming models in response to COVID-19, Boston Cares is seeking volunteers to help the community. Boston Cares offers a virtual volunteer orientation program so people can begin to help others while maintaining their social distancing.

5. California Food Policy Advocates

With offices in Oakland, Los Angeles, and San Diego, California Food Policy Advocates (CFPA) pushes policy solutions to help low-income people across the state access healthy food. CFPA supported and will help implement national COVID-19 response programs in California, including those enacted by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. CFPA is also using its email newsletter as a way to keep the community informed about advocacy opportunities and policy responses to the coronavirus. You can donate here.

6. Chef Ann Foundation

The Chef Ann Foundation is a Colorado-based nonprofit helping schools around the country serve kids healthier, tastier, scratch-made lunches. As schools respond to coronavirus-related closures, the Chef Ann Foundation is sharing successful tactics and best practices from their partner districts. They’re working to make it as easy as possible to develop remote food programs and other support for students. In addition to accepting donations, the Chef Ann Foundation is also collecting messages for a nationwide Thank You card for school food workers across America.

7. Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE)

Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE) offers support to families of food and beverage service workers facing serious challenges, from serious illness and death to injury or eviction. CORE grants help families with everything they need to weather tough times — medical bills, gas, groceries, clothing, utilities, rent, and more. Since 2004, CORE has supported more than 600 families and raised over $4 million. Currently, CORE is setting aside grants specifically for families of restaurant employees who have tested positive for COVID-19.

8. City Harvest

As restaurants closed and events were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, much of the food that would have been served did not go to waste, thanks to City Harvest. The New York City-based food rescue organization received 50,000 pounds of donated food last week — five times their normal intake — and distributed it to food pantries, soup kitchens, and directly to families in need. Monetary donations to City Harvest will help provide more shelf-stable food relief to people in need and ensure their delivery schedule can meet the increased need.

9. Dining at a Distance

Dining at a Distance, created specifically to support food providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers dozens of local, community-sourced databases of farms and restaurants that remain open for business. Residents of nearly 50 cities of all sizes around the globe, from Berlin to Boston to Corinth, Mississippi, can find contact information for restaurants, takeout and delivery details, and comments from community members. Dining at a Distance also offers databases of farms in all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C., broken down by crop type, organic certification, and how consumers can pick up or receive fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, and more. You can get involved by adding restaurants and farms to the database or starting a new database if your city isn’t listed.

10. Family Agriculture Resource Management Services (F.A.R.M.S.)

Recognizing the systemic challenges and discrimination Black farmers face in the United States, attorney Jillian Hishaw founded Family Agriculture Resource Management Services. F.A.R.M.S. provides legal assistance to farmers with limited resources and helps them retain control and ownership of their land. The Farmers Emergency Fund, which is open to small rural farmers, but not farm employees, is aimed at making sure aging farmers and those from historically disadvantaged groups can stay afloat during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Stipends are limited to $500.

11. The Farmer Fund

Although The Farmer Fund was initially founded to help Georgia farmers facing destruction from natural disasters, “we have seen over the past few days that a pandemic like COVID-19 is its own natural disaster — and is certainly an emergency,” they write. The Farmer Fund, now run by Georgia Organics, has raised over US$50,000 to support farmers in the state since 2018. Now, donations to the fund will help farmers survive the pandemic, rebuild, and continue feeding Georgians through markets, CSAs, and restaurant sales.

12. Farmworker Justice

Through legal advocacy in government, regulatory agencies, and in the court system, Farmworker Justice aims to secure legal rights for agricultural workers and improve their working conditions. With dedicated attorneys on staff, Farmworker Justice represents agricultural workers in lawsuits and regulatory petitions. At the same time, they educate both policymakers and the public about the challenges they face. “All of these workers are in perilous situations and being given absolutely no respect in the narrative of COVID-19,” food activist and journalist Raj Patel told me on Food Talk with Dani Nierenberg.”

13. Feed the Front Line NOLA

In three steps, Feed the Front Line supports restaurants, musicians and artists, and hospital workers caring for those impacted by COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana. First, every donation goes toward ordering meals from local restaurants for ER shift crews. Second, local musicians and artists who have lost out on gigs are hired to pick up the food and deliver it to a local hospital. Third, the talented deliverers drop off the food with a side of morale-boosting “food love.” During the last week of March, Feed the Front Line NOLA fed 1,200 hospital workers with 35 deliveries, putting $10,000 toward local restaurants, musicians, and artists. On Saturday, April 4, alone, they served 1,800 meals. If you want to “send food love,” you can donate online.

14. Float Small Business & Portland Community SOS

Float Small Business and Portland Community SOS are two initiatives in Portland, OR, with similar missions: encouraging community members to support local businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Float Small Business has pages devoted to restaurants & bars, cafes, and grocers & specialty shops, with links to support funds so you can give money directly to restaurants struggling to survive. Portland Community SOS is focused on gift cards, and offers links to the websites of restaurants and cafes that offer them. Portland Community SOS also offers a page of resources for business owners.

15. Food Chain Workers Alliance

By uniting worker-based organizations into a broad coalition, the Food Chain Workers Alliance (FCWA) stands up for more than 375,000 workers who “plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, [by] organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain.” In a survey, the Food Chain Workers Alliance found that 80 percent of all food workers were not given paid sick days, and 43 percent said they feared they would lose their job if they took a sick day. In response to the dangers of COVID-19, the Food Chain Workers Alliance is fighting for the health and safety of workers, fair wages and working conditions, and support for street vendors and undocumented immigrants.

16. Food Recovery Network

Since its inception in 2011, Food Recovery Network has rescued more than 3.2 million pounds of food and has a presence on 230 college campuses across the United States. Food Recovery Network empowers students, communities, and food businesses to reconstruct their perceptions and habits around surplus food. To support businesses making difficult choices in closing or paring down operations, FRN has created a four-step COVID-19 Food Recovery Guide to make donating excess food as simple as possible.

17. Frontline Foods

Hospital workers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, often working day and night treating patients. Meanwhile, local restaurants are struggling financially. Frontline Foods aims to address both issues: With donations processed through Chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen, Frontline Foods pays local restaurants to cook and deliver meals to hospital workers in their community. With 28 chapters in 21 U.S. states, Frontline Foods has raised over US$1 million and delivered more than 7,000 meals during the COVID-19 outbreak. You can donate through World Central Kitchen here or sign up as a volunteer.

18. Gift Card Army

Based in Portland, OR, Gift Card Army offers a searchable directory of local restaurants, cafes, bars, and other retail shops that remain open for delivery, takeout, or—as the name suggests—gift cards, which can help a small business stay afloat during COVID-19 even if they suspend kitchen operations. Gift Card Army allows you to search for restaurants in the Portland area geographically as well, and a map-based search function is under development. If you operate a small business, you can enter your info into the search engine here.

19. Good Farmer Fund

A project of the Seattle Neighborhood Farmers Markets, the Good Farmer Fund assists small and new farms facing any sort of crisis—extreme weather, fire, equipment damage, flood, predators, and more. Margins for farms can be razor-thin, and the Good Farmer Fund has given more than US$280,000 to over 80 farms since 2008 to help them land on their feet. As markets shut down and demand drops due to COVID-19, the Good Farmer Fund will be issuing several round of grants over the next few months. They accept donations to the fund and applications for grants on their website.

20. Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen

Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen is New York City’s largest emergency food-relief organization. In addition to their soup kitchen, their Backpack Pantry Program helps ensure that school-aged kids in NYC—one in ten of whom lived in a homeless shelter at some point last year—have food to eat. Recently, Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen launched the Coronavirus Hot Meal Distribution Campaign, which has raised over US$28,000 of its US$1 million goal to provide hot meals to New York City residents in need.

21. Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center

The Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center develops intersectoral, innovative, and evidence-based solutions to prevent diet-related diseases and promote food security in New York City and other urban centers. The Center works with policymakers, community organizations, advocates, and the public to create healthier, more sustainable food environments and use food to promote community and economic development. The Center is currently working to release Coronavirus NYC Food Resource Guides for each of NYC’s 59 neighborhoods with the following information: meals for children, meals for seniors, retail food stores and their delivery/benefits policies, local food pantries and soup kitchens, resources for homeless people, resources for immigrant populations, and resources for people with disabilities.

22. Italian Red Cross

Italy has been particularly affected by the coronavirus, with more COVID-19 cases and deaths than almost any other country. The Italian Red Cross (CRI) is working with the Italian Ministry of Health to manage the country’s response. CRI is helping set up special treatment structures and transporting potentially infected patients using biocontaminant vehicles. Additionally, they are supplying regional Italian Red Cross committees with testing and treatment materials. People around the world can donate to support the Italian Red Cross’ efforts, and if you live in Italy, you can sign up and train to volunteer online.

23. James Beard Foundation

The James Beard Foundation’s mission is to celebrate America’s food culture. At a time when restaurants, bars, and other independent food and beverage operations are facing temporary closures and reduced capacity, their futures may feel uncertain. To combat this financial strain, the Foundation launched the James Beard Foundation Food and Beverage Relief Fund. Donations will be used to provide micro-grants to independent businesses in need.

24. Little Tokyo Community Feeding Community Program

The Los Angeles neighborhood of Little Tokyo is the most populous Japantown district in the U.S. and, like much of the country, has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. The Community Feeding Community program is providing meals from small businesses in Little Tokyo and the Arts District to hospitality workers whose jobs were affected by COVID-19. The Community Feeding Community program is purchasing meals at full price to support businesses that remain open and, thanks to more than US$20,000 in community donations, is able to offer them for free pickup every Wednesday and Saturday at 5 p.m. You can donate online in US$15 increments.

25. Meals on Wheels

Meals on Wheels provides food, companionship, and safety checks for 2.4 million senior citizens across the U.S. While requests for service have increased amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many of Meals on Wheels’ clients—and older volunteers—are among the most vulnerable to the disease. Meals on Wheels America has begun a nationwide COVID-19 Response Fund, and many local providers—from Portland, OR, to Minneapolis, MN, to the Sarasota, FL, area—are also accepting donations and asking for younger, healthy community members to volunteer.

26. Miriam’s Kitchen

Since 1983, Miriam’s Kitchen has worked to address homelessness in Washington, D.C. In addition to serving meals, they also connect people with nurses, social workers, lawyers, and other advocates to help end homelessness in the long term—not simply respond to it. Many people experiencing homelessness are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19, so although Miriam’s Kitchen temporarily suspended its volunteer program for their safety, the organization is ramping up its outreach program to provide support to guests wherever they are.

27. National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON)

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) works to secure civil and political rights for low-wage workers and day laborers, or those who are hired and paid day-to-day. In its Worker & Migrant Justice Response to Coronavirus, NDLON condemned the “unprecedented levels of nativism, xenophobia, racial resentment, and dehumanization” made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. They call for providing medical treatment for all, releasing those in immigrant detention camps, and stopping deportations so all U.S. government resources can be put toward an “‘all hands on deck’ social effort.”

28. No Kid Hungry

As schools close in response to COVID-19, many children who rely on school lunch lose their only source of nutritious, high-quality meals. In response, No Kid Hungry has launched a multimillion-dollar campaign, including releasing US$1 million in immediate grants for school districts and nonprofit organizations to continue meals programs. Donations to No Kid Hungry also provide resources to families in need and support outreach efforts, so they know how to find meals during school closures.

29. Nourish Your Neighbors and #EatStrongRI

Nourish Your Neighbors is providing hundreds of meals per week to families and seniors across Rhode Island. The program is run by Hope & Main, an entrepreneurial incubator program aimed at supporting the local food economy, and you can donate online. They have also started a campaign called #EatStrongRI, to rally people around the necessity of shopping locally during COVID-19. Their webpage provides resources to make it easy to support the local food system: You can find apps that let you shop directly from Rhode Island farmers, independent restaurants offering takeout and delivery, and information about their weekly What’s Local Wednesdays pop-up takeout series. Hope & Main also invites you to share how you’re supporting your local food producers by using #EatStrongRI.

30. On The Line

On The Line is paying local restaurants in Westchester County, New York, to make meals for vulnerable community members. Nearly 20 restaurants are participating in the project, preparing meals to be served to food-insecure kids, senior citizens, immunocompromised or newly unemployed people, and those whose housing is not stable. As of the first week of May, On The Line has distributed 8,000 meals, and has been able to support restaurant staff and food purveyors by paying US$5 per meal. On The Line and is currently fundraising with the goal of paying restaurants US$7 per meal and feeding 4,000 more over the next two weeks. Donations are accepted online.

31. One Fair Wage

Advocates at One Fair Wage are working to end the tipped minimum wage, a practice in the U.S. that allows employers to pay workers significantly less than the legal minimum wage if they also earn tips. With many restaurants across the country closing or reducing service—and sectors such as ridesharing and nail/hair salons also significantly affected—One Fair Wage has launched an Emergency Coronavirus Tipped and Service Worker Support Fund. This effort will provide restaurant workers, Lyft/Uber drivers, and other tipped wage-earners with money they need for basic expenses, like food and rent.

32. The Power of 10

A new initiative that launched in response to COVID-19, The Power of 10 is a “restaurant revitalization plan” conceived by chef Erik Bruner-Yang. The Power of 10 aims to use one donation to fund restaurants, support employees, and feed food-insecure communities for free. If a restaurant could receive a $10,000 donation, it could re-employ 10 full-time staff and serve 1,000 free meals — hence, the power of 10. The initiative is being piloted at three restaurants in Washington, D.C.: Cane, ABC Pony, and Maketto, which is helmed by Bruner-Yang. The model is coming to Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, and is scalable for any size community across the country. You can make donations in amounts that are, appropriately, powers of 10, starting at US$10.

33. Philly Restaurant Relief & Server Relief Fund

Restaurants in Philadelphia, like in many cities across the world, are subject to restrictions on dining-in due to COVID-19. To allow community members to continue supporting restaurants, the website Philly Restaurant Relief encourages people to pay their “check” in the form of a donation or gift card in the amount they might otherwise have spent on the meal. Philadelphia restaurant workers are also supported by the unrelated Philly Restaurant Server Relief Fund. This initiative aims to raise enough money to give servers $400 a week, the average they would otherwise earn, until at least the beginning of April.

34. Provision Community Restaurant

Provision Community Restaurant is the first pay-as-you-can restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Typically, they invite all community members for family-style dinners and Saturday brunches, which is not currently possible because of dine-in restrictions due to COVID-19. As restaurants shifted their operations, many donated excess food to Provision. Now, twice every weekday, Provision is offering free, single-serve take-out dinners to anyone who needs it. They are still accepting donations of food and money to support the community.

88,88,"Mar 24, 2020",Successful Farming,What farmers need to know about COVID-19,"As COVID-19 makes headlines and heightens uncertainty around the country, farmers and others in rural America are looking for answers. The new coronavirus has been disruptive to markets as well as farm families’ lifestyles.

Ag economist David Widmar predicts that the decisions made during the COVID-19 outbreak will be studied for years to come. He says four key sources of uncertainty make this time difficult for agriculture.

Relief for Farmers and Agriculture Industry

Congress allotted $23.5 billion for agriculture in the coronavirus relief package, but ""that amount of money will not sustain"" the farm sector, said Zippy Duvall, American Farm Bureau Federation president.

Markets and Prices

Stock prices have fallen over the last month, and commodity prices have followed.

Economists Brent Gloy and David Widmar explained the outbreak is costing farmers $50 to $90 an acre from the lost corn and soybean revenue that farmers expected this year.

However, market analyst Ray Grabanski says demand for food is going up much faster and more than even the most optimistic food producer expected.

As the virus continues to spread quickly, consumers are stocking up on necessities such as bread, crackers, and pasta. Grabanski says this is why wheat is trading higher than before the virus sell-off occurred on March 21.

Shoppers stockpiling meat has caused wholesale beef prices have jumped to record levels, but the spike in prices isn't helping cattle farmers. Cattle prices have actually declined since January, putting many ranchers in a precarious financial position.

In addition to groceries, live chickens are on some people's panic buying list. Poultry specialist and veterinarian David Frame shares eight important points to consider before purchasing chicks.

READ MORE: Baby chicks are on the panic buy list

Farmers who sell directly to the public or institutions are especially concerned about market closures.

David Newman of Missouri sells 95% of his pork to the restaurant industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. He says demand has still been good as restaurants have moved to take out and delivery options, but the situation has added new logistics challenges.

“Farmers markets are essential activities for the economic livelihood of farmers and for food access for millions of Americans,” says Ben Feldman, executive director of the Farmers Market Coalition. “The closure of markets has the potential to bankrupt farmers and force people to go without food.”

In a recent teleconference about farmland, Mark Dozour, former chief economist of the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M, and Steve Bruere, owner of People's Company, said farmland is holding relatively steady in the wake of COVID-19.

Banking and finance

Low interest rates have been dropped further creating an opportunity for some farmers to refinance. After a phone call and a bit of paperwork with his banker, Indiana farmer Brian Scott is on track to save $100,000 in the next four years by refinancing one farmland loan and his home mortgage.

READ MORE: Why farmers should talk to their banker about refinancing today

The Farm Credit Administration has urged the institutions in its system to work with farmers who have been affected by COVID-19. These institutions may be able to alleviate stress for farmers by extending the terms of loan repayments, restructuring borrowers’ debt obligations, or easing some loan documentation or credit-extension terms of new loans to certain borrowers.

Economist David Whitaker says he expects COVID-19 to be a small shadow compared with the economic downturn to come.

Ethanol

At the beginning of the month, some ethanol producers worldwide said demand was up for their products as people stockpiled hand sanitizer, which can be made from the biofuel.

READ MORE: Ethanol makers see demand surge on hand sanitizer stockpiling

Now, fewer Americans are driving to work, school, and events amid the outbreak. This could have a dramatic negative impact on corn demand by the U.S. ethanol oil industry, says Todd Hubbs of the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois.

Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper confirmed U.S. ethanol producers are on track to shut about 2 billion gallons of annualized output by then end of March because of the slump in demand for fuel.

Supply chains and logistics

COVID-19 is also creating supply chain concerns for farmers around the country. Iowa pig farmer Katherine Marcano-Bell says, “We worry about plants shutting down and us having to keep pigs for a longer period of time.”

Although the plant is not closing, the first confirmed case of a slaughterhouse worker infected with COVID-19 was reported Monday at a Mississippi poultry processing plant.

In a tweet last week, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said, “Food supply is sound, it’s stable & there’s plenty of food available. To the folks working in grocery stores & driving trucks full of products: Y’all are the heroes in the food supply chain.”

Farm labor

Many farm families with school-age children now must juggle childcare along with the usual farm chores. This may require relying on family members who normally work on the farm or are of higher risk for the virus.

For Marcano-Bell, labor issues are top of mind as COVID-19 shutters businesses and schools in the state. Her family does the work on the farm themselves.

The Iowa Department of Public Health has recommended farms and other businesses cross-train and prioritize critical functions.

In 2019 about 180,000 farmworkers from other countries worked in the U.S. under the H-2A program. More than half of all these workers are concetrated in five states and many come to work on large fruit and vegetable farms. Farmers who rely on these seasonal workers are concerned delays caused by COVID-19 will keep workers from arriving on time.

Planting Plans

Economist Todd Hubbs says, ""We'll be swimming in corn"" after farmers indicated they will plant a larger-than-expected 97 million acres of corn. That could produce 15.9 billion bushels of corn, assuming normal weather and yields.

Connectivity

With classes canceled across the country, parents and students are clamoring for educational activities that can be done in isolation. FFA Advisor Alex Rogers recommends a host of online activities for high schoolers interested in animal science, welding, and more while they’re away from school.

READ MORE: Ag students can learn online

While people are working and learning behind their screens at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, people in rural America are having a harder time getting connected.

Although online farm auctions have been a way of business for some companies for years, some farmers are buying equipment online for the first time as the CDC has recommended gatherings of no more than 10 people to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

Farmers’ health

Farmers are proud of being hard working and tough. “It’s not a time for farmers to be that tough guy,” says veterinarian Jim Lowe. “If you get sick, after getting on the tractor to plant, get yourself isolated and don’t infect your family.”

President Donald Trump’s signature food aid program is sending less relief to New York and New England than other parts of the country, even though the Northeast has the most coronavirus cases. Some states — Maine and Alaska at least — have been left out completely so far.

The regional imbalances are an unintended side effect of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s strategy in hiring private contractors to distribute food, the agency said. It is now looking for ways to reach areas that were passed over.

“USDA is evaluating how we might expand access to the program in areas that are underserved,” the agency said in a statement.

Out of $1.2 billion in the program’s first round, just $46 million is going to the Northeast. The region, which encompasses New York and New England, has the most coronavirus cases but received the least money of any region except the Mountain Plains, which has almost half as many people.

By contrast, the Southwest (including Texas) is getting more than five times as much money even though it has only about 50% more people and a quarter as many coronavirus cases.

Food Aid Funding Is Lowest in the Hardest-Hit Areas In President Donald Trump’s signature food relief program for the coronavirus pandemic, the Northeast — the hardest-hit region — got the least amount of money per confirmed COVID-19 case. Sources: USDA, Johns Hopkins University Isaac Arnsdorf/ProPublica

Put another way, the Northeast has 10% of the country’s population and 33% of COVID-19 cases but is receiving only 4% of food relief dollars, according to ProPublica’s analysis of data from the USDA, the Census Bureau and Johns Hopkins University.

The pandemic is also taking a severe economic toll on New England. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, unemployment claims from March 21 to April 11 equaled 16.6% of the region’s total workforce, and 36% of renters and 18% of homeowners in New England are at risk of being unable to make their payments.

Trump and his daughter Ivanka have personally heralded the USDA’s new program, which is meant to deliver boxes of fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy to food banks, churches and other nonprofits. Instead of using its regular system for buying and distributing food, which typically handles nonperishable items in bulk, the USDA awarded contracts to private distributors.

The process was unusually fast for government contracting: Companies had only a week to apply, and the USDA announced the winners a week later.

Although the USDA announced the contracts on a regional basis, the agency had no method for allocating funding to each region — it just depended on which companies won their bids. “The amounts and locations awarded were based on the offers received and the evaluation of those offers,” the USDA said.

The relative dearth of distributors in the Northeast is making it harder for food banks there to meet the needs of their communities. In Rochester, New York, the Foodlink food bank consulted with dozens of companies that it has worked with about applying for the USDA contracts. But none of those bids were successful, and Foodlink didn’t have a relationship with any of the winning contractors.

Now the food bank is in touch with the winning distributors but has yet to receive any shipments. As a result, it doesn’t have much fresh food to give out, even as the city’s service hotline is getting a surge of calls from people needing food, according to Foodlink’s chief strategy officer, Mitch Gruber.

“We could have had more food sooner, and they could have guaranteed more geographic representation across the nation if the program had been designed around food banks and not around distributors,” Gruber, who’s also a Democratic member of Rochester’s city council, said in an interview. “Everyone’s genuinely trying to best connect surplus at farms with increased need at food banks, and I’m glad the USDA is trying to fill that void. The smartest way to have done it would be to fund the food banks and work backwards to food distributors and vendors to serve them, rather than to have the USDA work with distributors and vendors.”

Read More Wedding Planner, Caterer, “Brand Builder”: Trump’s Food Aid Program Is Paying $100+ Million to Unlicensed Dealers Contractors with no experience in food distribution are looking for suppliers on Facebook while some food banks scramble to find desperately needed deliveries.

Thus far, the USDA has awarded $1.2 billion worth of contracts to distributors, out of $3 billion available overall. The agency said the contracts were competitively evaluated based on the companies’ ability to deliver.

But some of the winning bids raised eyebrows because the companies appeared to lack experience in food distribution or did not have a proper USDA license. At the same time, some applicants with more traditional qualifications said their bids were denied on mistaken grounds.

Three key Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee asked the USDA to explain how it evaluated the bids, including if it checked companies’ licenses and considered equity across regions.

“We share USDA’s goal of providing effective and timely assistance to families, farmers, and food supply businesses like food distributors,” Reps. Stacey Plaskett, Jim Costa and Marcia Fudge said in a letter Friday to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “We are concerned, however, that contracts were awarded to entities with little to no experience in agriculture or food distribution and with little capacity to meet the obligations of their award.”

The USDA defended its selections. “A lot of groups and organizations have some very great abilities that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to assess by looking at the name of the organization,” Greg Ibach, the USDA’s under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. “We feel confident that between our screening process and our audit process that we will be able to assure that those companies will be successful in fulfilling the responsibilities and the design of our program.”

One of the rejected applicants was a local distributor in Maine called Native Maine Produce & Specialty Foods. The USDA told the company its application was missing a signature on a certain page, according to vice president of sales Jimmy Davolio. Davolio said he rechecked the paperwork and the signature was there.

“I don’t know what we could have missed,” Davolio said.

No other companies serving Maine won contracts either, so the state is receiving no food boxes, according to the state Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.

“We were disappointed we didn’t get it, but now I’m more disappointed that the folks in Maine aren’t getting those funds,” Davolio said in an interview. “We bid where we thought we could help. Now I feel terrible.”

The state is sorely missing the relief as food bank demand has tripled in some places, at a statewide average of about 35%, according to Kristen Miale, president of the Auburn-based Good Shepherd Food Bank, which serves a statewide network. Maine’s growers are also hurting and looking for new customers since their primary buyers — restaurants and the food service industry — have been largely shuttered.

“We need to be distributing a lot more food. Our primary constraint is we just don’t have enough food to give out,” Miale said. “This program would be a huge help.”

Miale is hoping that the USDA will give Maine distributors another chance, taking into account the logistical challenges of a sprawling, rural state with islands and mountains.

“They kind of put out a one-size-fits-all approach and it didn’t fit for everybody,” Miale said. “So now let’s go back and look at it again.”

Maine’s agricultural commissioner, Amanda Beal, formally asked the USDA to reopen the bidding process in the fall to give Maine distributors time to develop a way to participate.

“Like all small businesses in Maine, farmers in our state have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but are eager to continue to grow food for consumers,” Beal said in a letter to the USDA on Thursday. “Likewise, many families in Maine need extra support during this unprecedented time, and it has been projected that food insecurity in Maine could increase by as much as 39 percent in 2020 due to COVID-19. We are confident that the Farmers to Families Food Box Program can help provide much-needed support for both, but only if the program can be adapted and flexibility be given to fit individual state needs.”

In another corner of the country, Alaska was also left with no access to the program. Two companies submitted bids but the USDA didn’t accept them, according to Cara Durr, director of public engagement for the Food Bank of Alaska, which serves the entire state.

Though Alaska has kept its case count down to only about 400, the shutdowns imposed to control the outbreak have taken a steep economic toll and made it harder for remote communities — many inaccessible by road — to get needed supplies. The state’s budget is also heavily dependent on oil, whose price has cratered.

The Food Bank of Alaska found a workaround where one local company signed on as a subcontractor to a winning bidder. That company is now supplying hard fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, apples and oranges.

But they’re still not able to receive meat or dairy, and the shipments won’t reach outside Anchorage to more far-flung places like Fairbanks, Durr said.

“The cost to bring food up to Alaska wasn’t factored in,” Durr said. “We would have loved to have gotten more through this program. Supporting local in-state vendors when there are applications would have been a much better way to go, for our state at least.”

90,90,"Dec 31, 2020",NBC News,"As Covid surges in Mississippi Delta, food banks and hospitals are stretched thin","JACKSON, Miss. — Four days before Christmas, Chiquikta Fountain watched as a growing line of cars stretched down a mile of road in the Mississippi Delta.

From her vantage point, it seemed like every resident in the rural town of Shaw was en route to the holiday meal giveaway at Delta Hands for Hope, a nonprofit she runs to support the area’s children.

The Dec. 21 event was meant to be a cheerful affair, despite the desperate need. Hams had been purchased from a mom-and-pop grocery store. There were bags of freshly picked greens, potatoes and onions for sides. With schools on winter break, volunteers tucked cereal and cases of orange juice into bags to help tide over families with children into the new year.

There were only 140 meals to distribute in the town of roughly 1,700. The meals were meant for a group of families and senior citizens who have relied heavily on the nonprofit for weekly assistance. But word spread quickly and it soon became clear that the food on hand wouldn’t be enough.

As supplies dwindled, the group began passing out the remnants. Produce for one person, a few boxes of cereal for another.

“To have to turn these families away,” Fountain said, “I can’t even describe what it felt like to you to do that.”

Before the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger. Almost 40 percent of its residents live in poverty. In areas like Shaw, trying to make ends meet has become even more fraught as the county struggles with the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the Mississippi Delta.

Weekly case counts in December have surpassed the peak of the county’s summer surge, when so many fell ill that the county coroner asked the board of supervisors to purchase an extra refrigerator for fear he would run out of space to store the dead.

That the recent surge has so far claimed fewer lives compared to previous peaks has left little room for comfort. Cases in the county quadrupled in the weeks after Thanksgiving.

Statewide, hospitalizations for patients with the virus spiked, plummeting the number of available intensive care unit beds in the state’s rural areas and larger cities alike. By the third week of December, Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, the county’s only hospital, ran out of ICU beds, a situation that could recur as cases rise.

L. Nicole Stringfellow, who leads the Mississippi Delta office of Together for Hope, a nonprofit that assists the country’s poorest rural communities, has heard concerns about people with pneumonia showing up at hospitals only to be sent home with instructions to monitor their symptoms.

Caitlyn Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bolivar Medical Center, acknowledged that the hospital had seen an increase in patients, but said its admitting and triage practices had not changed.

The Covid-19 crisis has compounded existing health care challenges in Bolivar County: Almost 1 in 6 residents are uninsured and more likely to put off treatment as a result, and there is a shortage of medical providers.

Unlike major cities where people can access public transportation, residents without cars in rural areas like Shaw have few options for getting to medical appointments. Almost 1 in 8 households in Bolivar County lack a car, making carpooling for errands common.

Nurse practitioner Nora Gough-Davis owns Shaw Family Medical, a clinic that offers home coronavirus testing for patients without the means to come into town. Some patients feared exposing their loved ones to the virus if they asked for a ride.

Several times a week, Tracy Hall, a nurse at Shaw Family Medical, dons a surgical gown, mask, face shield and gloves and enters a home. Sometimes, she sees a patient lying on a couch, barely able to move as she swabs.

Every morning, her husband gives her the same goodbye.

""Babe, be safe.""

On the way to work, she says a prayer in her car. On occasion, patients have asked her to pray that their tests come back negative.

She understands their fears. In Bolivar County, the fallout from the virus has been particularly pernicious. Three out of every 1,000 residents in the area have died from Covid-19. Only a handful of communities in Mississippi — several of them, like Bolivar, predominantly Black and in the Delta — have lost more.

Before Mississippi’s state health officer uttered the words “hot spot,” before the local hospital ran out of ICU beds, health outcomes for Black residents in Bolivar County were already troubling.

The consequences of a shortage of health care providers in the Mississippi Delta have been evident for decades. Shorter lives. Higher rates of amputations. Stringfellow said political leaders haven’t paid enough attention to these disparities. The pandemic, she said, makes it harder to look away.

She pointed out that four years ago, the State Health Department shut down one of the two state-run medical clinics in Bolivar. A steep drop in patients was cited as the reason, but Stringfellow said the health care needs in the region remain high.

“How do you catch those areas up?” she asked. “True access to health care.”

The current state of public education, economic opportunity, housing and health care in the region, all beleaguered in their respective ways, she argues, are “putting a Band-Aid on open-heart surgery.”

While the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has brought a note of hope for many front-line workers, physical health is only one part of the battle. The mental trauma that accompanies persistent poverty in the Delta has escalated as families struggle with the fallout of the pandemic.

“It’s like working in a funhouse mirror,” said Nadia Bethley, a psychologist with the Delta Health Center, a nonprofit that provides health care to low-income patients on a sliding fee scale. “Things weren’t great before. Now, they’re distorted and worse in a lot of ways.”

She feared for her patients leading up to the first Christmas some would experience without their loved ones. She worried about those who were already isolated becoming further detached, like many others around the world affected by this pandemic. Patients who loved attending church services and socializing before and after sermons didn’t feel the same connection online.

Others have survived the virus only to feel challenged cognitively, almost like they had a stroke. Bethley said they want to know if they’ll fully recover.

“Having to sit with people and hold space for that kind of uncertainty, shrugging my shoulders, like ‘I don’t know either,’ those are the kind of things that have hit hard the most,” she said.

Many of her patients have found their livelihoods in limbo.

“Family members who were the primary breadwinners are now dying,” Bethley said. “Do you go to work and put yourself at risk, or do you become homeless or starving?”

Job security remains fragile in the community. Half of the residents make less than $30,000 per year. And although Cleveland, the county seat of Bolivar, is a university town, which brings economic activity, good jobs are scarce enough that some residents travel across state lines for work. For two years, dozens of residents have gathered daily outside the county’s Walmart, one of the few grocery stores in the area, waiting for charter buses to ferry them to Memphis, Tennessee, two hours away, to work at a FedEx hub, where some workers make upwards of $18 per hour.

The county’s unemployment rate, which climbed to double digits in the summer, has since improved, but remains higher than this time last year.

Caressa McKay, a single mother of five in Shelby, a small town in Bolivar County, was laid off from her job at a day care center in June. She’s since found another job, but she still has to skip a phone bill or an electric bill some months to make sure her children have enough to eat.

The public assistance she receives is “not enough to constantly keep food on the table,” she said. Meals dropped off by her local school district help, but with her children home all day for remote schooling, they need more food.

“They have to eat,” she said. “I have to do what I have to do.”

Mississippi state Rep. Abe Hudson Jr., a Democrat who lives in Bolivar County, said workers have been hit hard as local businesses struggle to stay afloat.

The people who are seeking help, he said, run the gamut from middle-class professionals now stretched thin to elderly residents hesitant to enter grocery stores.

“You don’t realize the degree of need until you go out to some of these food distribution events,” Hudson said. “It’s a constant reminder of the fact that people are not getting paychecks.”

That reminder is never far from Fountain.

The nonprofit she leads, Delta Hands for Hope, previously served as a tutoring site for students and assisted with volunteer projects. Last spring, the center began operating an emergency food pantry.

But now, the food bank’s future is in question. Recently, the nonprofit went from receiving 800 boxes of fresh food twice a month to none.

The U.S. Agriculture Department’s food box program had changed its funding rules and declined to renew a contract with the farm that had been supplying Delta Hands for Hope.

Fountain’s group now uses a private grant to buy food from a corporate restaurant supplier with the goal of feeding at least 140 children and senior citizens in Shaw per week. She’s unsure if the funding will carry them past spring break.

Occasionally, she receives an alert that a church or a food bank in the region has enough to share. The group rents or borrows a truck to pick up the food.

“The biggest question is, ‘Are we going to remain an emergency food pantry?’” she asked. “What happens when those funds run out?”","Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi TodayBefore the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger.

When the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Revere HealthCare Center opened its therapeutic food pantry in January 2020, the plan was to start off with a three-month, 10-patient pilot program. The pantry would provide plenty of plant-based, healthy food to the patients, all of whom had nutrition-dependent chronic diseases, like diabetes and obesity, and were food insecure, meaning they lacked enough food to live a healthy and active life.

“Of course, then COVID hit,” says Jacob Mirsky, MD, a primary care physician at MGH Revere and the food pantry’s medical director.

The number of community members in the Boston area struggling to access nutritious food jumped in March as the measures put in place to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic hit them economically. Mirsky and his team decided to rehaul the entire operation and expand service to every patient treated at the center and their families.

With funding from MGH Revere and partnerships with local food nonprofits, the pantry grew from operating out of a closet to filling a 1,000-square-foot storage space and feeding up to 80 patients and their families each week.

Food insecurity across the country has risen significantly since the pandemic sidelined 14 million workers in the United States from February to May, according to the Pew Research Center.

Feeding America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States, estimates that 17 million people in the country could become food insecure because of the pandemic, bringing the total to more than 54 million people in the country, including 18 million children. Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

Since food insecurity and poor nutrition are associated with several chronic illnesses that put people at higher risk for the more severe complications of COVID-19, the food access crisis threatens to exacerbate the already glaring disparities in health outcomes for vulnerable people, including low-income people, children, older adults, and immigrants living in the United States illegally.

“Though the factors underlying racial and ethnic disparities in Covid-19 in the United States are multifaceted and complex, long-standing disparities in nutrition and obesity play a crucial role in the health inequities unfolding during the pandemic,” writes a cohort of physicians and researchers in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September. “A healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and calorie-dense processed foods, is essential to health. The ability to eat a healthy diet is largely determined by one’s access to affordable, healthy foods — a consequence of the conditions and environment in which one lives.”

Mirsky believes that it is incumbent upon the health care system, and particularly academic medical centers, to take on a greater role in educating and connecting patients to healthy and tasty foods — and consequently reduce the prevalence of nutrition-related illnesses.

“We’re now living in a world where it is abundantly clear that the power of doctors and medical students and trainees expands beyond the walls of a health care setting,” Mirsky says. “Building these types of solutions [that address social determinants of health] is just as important — if not more important — than prescribing them medicine.”

Food is medicine

Over the past decade, a growing body of research has linked poor nutrition to poor health outcomes, particularly in patients with chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. This can stem from not only a lack of food but also an excess of unhealthy food that can cause obesity and contribute to other health problems. For many, this could be because they live in a food desert, where there are no grocery stores within a mile of their home, or because unhealthy food may be cheaper and easier to access.

The research has birthed a movement known as “Food is Medicine,” where physicians, nutrition experts, and policymakers encourage the use of programs that provide medically-tailored food to prevent and treat serious illnesses in patients, as opposed to relying solely on pharmaceuticals and other health care interventions.

“Food is really critically important for many of the diseases that are plaguing our country and the world,” Mirsky says.

A report published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2017 found that food insecurity was associated with 10 of the costliest and most deadly preventable diseases in the country, including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.

Conversely, a healthier diet, particularly one that focuses on plant-based meals, has been associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases, depression, and decreased mental function.

Barriers to access

But for millions of people in the United States, eating enough nutritious food is far easier said than done. Certain groups living in the United States face additional barriers and risks when it comes to nutrition and health, particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Children: Nearly 30 million children in the United States qualified for free or reduced-cost lunches at school in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated food insecurity among children, as the estimated number of food-insecure kids could jump from 11 million to an estimated 18 million, according to Feeding America. While many schools have continued to provide meals to children in need and food banks and pantries have amped up services, the disruption could have concerning long-term consequences. Studies have linked food insecurity in children to poor health, stunted development, behavioral issues, and difficulty keeping up in school, according to Feeding America.

Older adults: Seniors, generally defined as people age 65 and older, are at increased risk of the more severe complications that come with COVID-19. Consequently, those who live on low and fixed incomes face greater barriers to accessing adequate nutrition. This can, in turn, further increase their vulnerability to poor health outcomes.

“A lot of older adults, unfortunately, don’t have a generous retirement income,” explains David Buys, PhD, MSPH, an associate professor at Mississippi State University Extension and College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who has studied food insecurity in older adults. “They might be living on nothing but Social Security. Some might not have Social Security. We know that we have an increasing number of grandparents raising grandchildren … that can be a challenge.”

Buys says that older adults who are frail or lack transportation may struggle to get to the grocery store or to a food pantry — and that some are afraid to go out and risk exposing themselves to infection.

Food banks, food pantries, and other community outreach organizations have had to be creative in ways that they serve older adults since the pandemic hit, such as delivering food to their homes, drawing on long-standing programs like Meals on Wheels, Buys says.

One study from before the pandemic found that, in a group of older adults discharged from the hospital, those seniors that received meals delivered by Meals on Wheels had lower rates of hospital readmission in three and six months than expected.

Providing healthy meals can be a key to keeping older adults healthy and out of the hospital or congregate health care situations that might increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. It’s an issue of particular concern since more than 84% of people over the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition and many face economic hardship as a result of medical debt, according to the National Council on Aging.

Immigrants in the United States illegally: While Latino communities in the United States in general have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, immigrants in the country without legal permission — many of whom are Latino — are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity because they are not eligible for many government relief programs. Even before the pandemic, 1 in 4 experienced food insecurity, according to a 2016 report by Bread for the World, a nonprofit dedicated to ending hunger.

While Medicaid programs in some states, including California and Massachusetts, are beginning to cover the cost of programs that provide food to patients, people living in the country illegally are not eligible for Medicaid. Nor are they eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, nor the $1,200 stimulus check that the federal government approved earlier this year.

“We see a movement right now to integrate more food and nutrition services into health care delivery and financing,” explains Sarah Downer, JD, associate director of whole person care at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School. “But every gap that we have is a place where undocumented immigrants fall into that gap.”

Instead, many rely on local food pantries for aid, which were stretched thin early in the pandemic while trying to accommodate millions of new clients, says David Velasquez, a fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School who is also pursuing a master of business administration at Harvard Business School and a master in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.

“Food is a basic human need. And it’s something that we all deserve.” David Velasquez

Fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School

Velasquez, who experienced food insecurity himself as the child of Nicaraguan parents who originally came to the United States illegally before being granted asylum, decided during the early months of the pandemic to research policies that could support food access for immigrants during this crisis.

He teamed up with another Harvard medical student, Jordan Kondo, and two attorneys from the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, Downer and Emily Broad Lieb, JD, to write a journal article that argued for policies that could help bring relief to immigrants who aren’t eligible for much government aid.

For example, they said the government should make it a priority to fund emergency food services programs that are accessible to those living in the country illegally, such as food banks and community health centers, and that health systems should ensure that they are not excluded from programs that integrate nutrition into health care delivery.

“Food is a basic human need,” Velasquez says. “And it’s something that we all deserve.”

Facing a long-term problem

When Mirsky was crafting the model for MGH Revere’s therapeutic food pantry, it was important to him that the pantry provide not only nutritious food but also the means to enjoy it.

Patients who visited the pantry initially received pots and pans, a spatula, oil, spices, and consultations with a nutritionist who could help them come up with recipes that they enjoy. The goal is to foster self-motivated healthy lifestyles. When the pantry expanded to a greater number of patients due to the pandemic, they could no longer offer all these services, but they hope to reintroduce them in the future.

“Food and eating are an essential part of the human experience,” Mirsky says. “Cooking and enjoying healthy food is a very powerful and respectful way of improving someone’s life.”

The MGH Revere pantry in the Boston area is just one of many nutrition outreach programs that health care providers across the country have increasingly implemented in recent years, as the American Hospital Association highlights in its social determinants of health report series. More health care providers are screening for food insecurity regularly and helping connect their patients to resources.

Still, food insecurity persisted before the pandemic, and the pandemic has further stretched existing community resources, as NPR reported in September.

Mirsky notes that the pantry at MGH Revere is already feeling the strain and is leading an effort to raise funds for a permanent location for the pantry. He’s also concerned about how much food they will be able to acquire in the winter, when there will be less local produce available and as renewed COVID-19 surges threaten to further stress systems.

“Our goal is to recognize that this is a very long-term problem that is going to require a long-term solution.”","Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

The new coronavirus has ushered in uncertainty for everyone, and this is especially true for low-income families and vulnerable populations across our state. The pandemic is heightening the uncertainty, financial instability and food insecurity faced by one in five Mississippians every day. It's also illuminating the dangers of inadequate access to affordable and quality health care and the desperate need for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed HR 6201, the Coronavirus Response Act. This act, in part, allows:

Expanded access to SNAP, WIC, and the emergency food assistance program during the pandemic;

Immediate paid sick leave and paid family leave, expanded unemployment insurance, vital nutrition aid;

More Medicaid funds for states; and

Free COVID-19 testing and treatment, including for Americans without health coverage.

What do Mississippi’s legislators do in the face of the unprecedented challenges caused by the spread of this pandemic? Do they rush to draft legislation to ensure protections for its most vulnerable citizens? No. Also on Tuesday, the Mississippi House of Representatives declared a three-week recess, effectively stalling any relief struggling Mississippians might receive. The Mississippi Senate suspended its session the following day.

As we are all too aware, when it comes to this virus, a lot can happen in three weeks. For many Mississippians, it is the difference between life and death. I implore Mississippians to contact U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker to voice support for the Coronavirus Response Act and to contact their state representatives to urge compassionate action in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our elected officials’ failure to act immediately and decisively in the face of such imminent disaster is unconscionable and unacceptable. Contact your state legislator to demand the following actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Expand Medicaid to increase access to COVID-19 treatment for 163,000+ low-income Mississippians.

Leverage TANF dollars to offer emergency sick leave to low-income families.

Lift the legislature's 2017 prohibition on SNAP work requirement waivers previously available during economic downturns and job shortages. The pandemic illustrates the fragility of the service industry and many low-wage job opportunities.

Exempt groceries from Mississippi's general sales tax. Mississippi is one of just three states without a tax break on groceries, heightening hunger and poor health.

Place a moratorium on evictions, following the lead of several states and cities doing the same nationwide. Jackson's eviction rate is among the highest in the country and Mississippi's new law authorizing immediate eviction is among the harshest.

Jami Cameron, communications coordinator for International Paper Vicksburg, said the funds from IP’s Planting Hope Initiative will provide residents with access and availability to fresh and healthy foods, fitness activities and culinary programs to teach proper nutrition.

The Planting Hope goals are to continue distributing local foods to food pantries, increase U-pick days and extend the Vicksburg Community Garden’s reach to residents in need.

Shape Up Mississippi founder Linda Fondren said she was excited about the opportunities the grant makes available.

“The Vicksburg Community Garden Park is a valuable resource for the surrounding community, especially to promote exercise during the pandemic,” Fondren said. “We want to ensure that residents know it is available.”

Fondren said new signs showing access to the walking trail at the Vicksburg Community Garden Park will be built and a sensory interpretive trail on the paved walking trail, including planting 20 native plants purchased locally, will be established.

Benches will provide a place for visitors to rest and admire the park and there are ways the garden can be used as an outdoor classroom.

“Our garden is inside a locked fence,” Fondren said. “We can now build an interactive space with three raised beds outside the fence so visitors can access the raised beds at any time and learn about plants and herbs.”

The grant will also pay for installing paving stones and the purchase of garden tools.

“The support of International Paper also allows us to generate community attention and increase our reach for volunteers at the VCG,” Fondren said. “With the USDA/EPA’s Local Food Local Places technical assistance, we hope to create a sustainable plan to incorporate the VCG with the Vicksburg Farmer’s Market and the Catfish Row Museum’s demonstration kitchen and marketplace to create a food hub in our historic downtown.”

“We are so appreciative and excited to receive this grant from International Paper and to work with residents and IP volunteers to grow a more sustainable community,” Fondren said. “I can’t wait to sit down and discuss the volunteer opportunities you have so my team members can get involved.

95,95,"Mar 28, 2020",,What Happens If Workers Cutting Up the Nation’s Meat Get Sick?,"Series: On the Line How the Meatpacking Industry Became a Hotbed of COVID-19

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

Here’s what has happened in the meatpacking industry in the last week alone:

A federal food safety inspector in New York City, who oversaw meat processing plants, died from the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

A poultry worker in Mississippi, employed by America’s third largest chicken company, tested positive for the virus, causing a half-dozen workers to self-quarantine. Another worker in South Dakota, employed by the world’s largest pork producer, also tested positive.

In Georgia, dozens of workers walked out of a Perdue Farms chicken plant, demanding that the company do more to protect them.

And Tyson Foods told ProPublica on Friday that “a limited number of team members” had tested positive for the disease.

As COVID-19 makes its way across the country, leading to panic grocery buying in state after state, the stresses on the nation’s food supply chain have ratcheted ever higher. But in industries like meatpacking, which rely on often grueling shoulder-to-shoulder work, so have the risks to workers’ health.

In interviews this week, meat and poultry workers, some in the country without authorization, noted with irony that they have recently been labeled “essential” by an administration now facing down a pandemic. Yet the rules of their workplaces — and the need to keep food moving — pressure them to work in close quarters, even when sick.

Help Us Continue Reporting on COVID-19 Are you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we’re on track. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.

And it’s unclear how federal regulations that traditionally protect workers from harm in their workplaces will address a potentially deadly coronavirus.

“They are listening about social distancing on the TV and some of them try to practice it in their home, but when they go to work, they can’t do it,” said Father Roberto Mena, who ministers to many poultry workers at St. Michael Catholic Church in Forest, Mississippi.

Many of the nation’s meatpackers declined to respond to specific questions about how they’ve dealt with infected workers or what they’ve done to try to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in their plants. Or they offered vague assurances that workers are being protected.

So far, only two meatpacking companies — Tyson Foods and Cargill — have announced companywide temperature checks to screen employees for signs of the virus. Two more say they have begun rolling them out.

But except for unionized plants, meat and poultry workers rarely get paid when they’re sick. At many companies, including Tyson, workers receive disciplinary points for calling in sick. Because points lead to termination, workers told ProPublica, they and some of their colleagues have continued to work even when sick, despite the coronavirus.

“We are all afraid,” said Maria, who works on the evisceration line at a Tyson plant in Arkansas and asked to be identified by her first name. “The problem is if people feel sick, they’re not going to say anything because they need the money. They don’t want the points.”

In an email, Tyson said it had recently altered its policies to allow workers who contract the coronavirus or exhibit symptoms to apply for short-term disability without a waiting period. “This is an evolving situation and we’re continuing to consider additional measures to support our team,” spokesman Worth Sparkman said. “We don’t want team members who feel sick to come to work.”

Tyson announced this month it was “eliminating any punitive effect for missing work due to illness.” But Maria said that at her plant, nothing had changed.

Despite the “essential” role meat and poultry workers play in the food chain, the sick-time bill signed by President Donald Trump last week doesn’t cover most meat and poultry workers because it exempts companies with more than 500 employees.

The uncertain economy, with millions of people filing jobless claims last week, is adding to the tension.

At Koch Foods in Mississippi, Ramirez, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant who asked to go by his last name, said a woman who worked near him showed up for her shift last week with a heavy cough. But after she told her supervisor, he said, she was told she couldn’t come back. The message was clear, he said. So, when he started feeling sick a few days later, he simply kept quiet and continued working.

“People are worried,” Ramirez said, that if they say they are sick, “they’ll fire us.”

Going to the doctor is not an option, he said, because he doesn’t have health insurance and fears it could expose his immigration status.

Koch Foods didn’t respond to calls and emails asking about its policies for sick workers.

Read More Coronavirus Panic Buying Puts Grocery Workers and Shoppers at Risk of Infection Braving grocery store crowds when you’re already stocked up puts you at risk of getting sick or infecting others, including elderly workers and others who have no choice but to be there.

Even before the coronavirus, the meat industry had complained of a labor shortage as low pay and harsh conditions collided with a tight labor market, tighter borders and dramatic reductions by the Trump administration in the number of refugees, who make up the backbone of many plants’ workforce.

While there’s no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food, workers say they fear it could spread among them, even though they wear butcher coats and latex gloves, and the plants are sanitized every night.

If it does, it could take out a critical cog in the nation’s food supply chain just as it struggles to keep up with increased demand, workers and their advocates said. Grocery meat sales, excluding deli meat, surged a staggering 77% for the week ending March 15, according to one industry analysis.

To meet the demand, companies have been scrambling, adding additional weekend shifts and changing lines to produce whole birds and bigger cuts of beef. Under pressure from unions and wage increases at supermarkets and warehouses, some companies like Cargill and National Beef have announced temporary $2 per hour bonuses for the next several weeks to retain their workers and reward them for sticking through difficult times.

Company executives have said that the empty shelves aren’t a sign of a food shortage and that they’re capable of meeting the surge, aided in part by lower demand from restaurants that have been ordered to close.

“Our primary focus is to keep our plants running so that we can feed America,” Tyson’s president, Dean Banks, said on CNN. “We’re running the plants as hard as we can.”

And some analysts note that even if an outbreak of the virus forced a plant to close, the industry — with more than 500,000 employees at 4,000 slaughterhouses and processing plants across the country — is big enough to absorb the loss.

Tim Ramey, a retired food industry analyst, said “there could be significant disruptions” in a company’s output if an outbreak occurred. But supermarkets and restaurants buy meat from many suppliers, he said, and another plant could pick up the slack.

“There are plenty of ways you could have risk to the worker supply,” Ramey said. “I doubt that would be enough to disrupt the food supply.”

But no one knows what would happen if multiple plants suffered outbreaks.

The closest precedent may be immigration raids, which have temporarily shuttered meat and poultry plants periodically over the last 25 years. For months after, those plants struggled to find new workers and ramp up to speed. But the supply lines continued to feed America.

Read More Can Low-Wage Industries Survive Without Immigrants and Refugees Case Farms’ history shows how many sectors like meatpacking depend on immigrants and refugees. Now business leaders fear President Trump’s policies will create a labor shortage.

Some immigrant workers caught up in those raids now marvel that the country is leaning on them. Last summer, after finishing his shift pulling the guts out of thousands of chickens, Ramirez flipped on his TV and watched in shock as immigration agents descended on central Mississippi, rounding up hundreds of his coworkers in the Trump administration’s biggest immigration sting.

In the weeks that followed, Ramirez watched the three children of a friend who’d been detained and hunkered down at home, fearing he could be next. It was easy to feel disposable, he said, especially when Trump praised the raids as “a very good deterrent.”

Now, when Ramirez watches the news, Trump is calling workers like him “critical,” telling them, “you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule.”

“I don’t understand, if they have a big need for all of the workers,” Ramirez asked, “why aren’t they worried about us?”

The slaughtering of chickens, hogs and cattle has become increasingly automated in the last few decades. But several tasks on the disassembly line still have to be done by hand. In poultry plants, in an area known as “live hang,” workers in a small, black-lit room crowd around a trough grabbing live chickens by their feet and hanging them on shackles.

In another area known as “debone,” workers stand side by side cutting raw chicken into breasts and tenders, so close that they occasionally cut coworkers with their knives.

In pork plants, workers are so packed together that a little over a decade ago, two dozen workers at a Minnesota factory developed a neurological illness from inhaling aerosolized pig brains that drifted from a nearby station that was making an ingredient used in stir-fry thickeners.

So even as everyone from the president to Snoop Dogg are urging people to stay home and avoid groups of more than 10 people, meat and poultry workers are required to do the opposite.

ProPublica asked the nation’s largest meat companies what they were doing to try to achieve social distancing. Cargill, which produces billions of pounds of beef and turkey for supermarkets and restaurants each year, was the only company that said it was doing anything other than staggering start and break times. Daniel Sullivan, a spokesman for the Minnesota-based meatpacker, said it had increased spacing in its factory work areas and put up partitions in its cafeteria.

The evisceration line where Maria, the Tyson employee, works doesn’t have as many people as other parts of the factory because it is heavily automated. But she said that because workers can’t leave the line unless it’s an emergency, she regularly encounters large crowds as everyone rushes to the bathroom during breaks. The company has placed hand sanitizers at the entrance, she said, but inside the plant, the bathrooms don’t always have paper towels.

As COVID-19 cases at the plants become public, workers fear it’s only the beginning.

On Monday, Sanderson Farms, the nation’s third largest chicken company, said an employee at its McComb, Mississippi, plant had tested positive for the virus. Sanderson said the employee’s work area was contained to one small processing table. In response, the company notified its workers and sent six other employees in the work area home to self-quarantine with pay.

The company did not respond to calls or emails seeking additional information.

On Thursday, a worker at pork producer Smithfield Foods’ plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, tested positive. The company told the Argus Leader that the employee’s work area and all common areas were “thoroughly sanitized.” But it did not say anything about workers who might have come in contact with the employee.

There have been even fewer details about the federal food safety inspector who died. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement that he was “terribly saddened to hear” that one of the department’s employees had passed away due to the coronavirus and thanked “those working on the front lines of our food supply chain.” But the department did not specify which plants the inspector had worked in or what had been done to alert or quarantine others the inspector may have been in contact with.

Paula Schelling, a union representative for the nation’s food inspectors at the American Federation of Government Employees, said the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service needs to do more to protect its front-line workers.

“FSIS is doing nothing to provide any protection for any employee who is out in the field,” she said. “They are just saying, ‘We are following the CDC guidelines.’ What does that mean to us?”

“People are worried,” a Koch Foods worker said. (Rory Doyle for ProPublica)

Concerns that meat companies aren’t being forthcoming have already led to increased anxiety at several plants. Workers who walked out of the Perdue plant in Georgia said the unrest started because supervisors dismissed concerns that some employees were continuing to work despite being in contact with people who had the coronavirus.

“We’re not getting nothing,” Kendilyn Granville told a TV news reporter outside the plant Monday night. “No type of compensation, no nothing, not even no cleanliness, no extra pay — no nothing. We’re up here risking our life for chicken.”

Perdue spokeswoman Diana Souder said that after speaking with managers, the majority of those who walked out returned to work.

“We know that many are feeling anxious during these uncertain times and we’re doing everything we can to take good care of our associates while continuing to produce safe and reliable food,” she said.

Typically, when workers feel unsafe, they can complain to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But it’s unclear how OSHA will respond to complaints related to the coronavirus. The agency, which has seen its ranks depleted under the Trump administration, has issued guidance for employers. But there is no specific standard related to the virus, and the agency has not said how it might interpret its general duty clause, which requires employers to keep their worksites free from recognized hazards that might cause death or “serious physical harm.”

Employers are only required to notify OSHA when an employee is hospitalized, suffers an amputation or is killed at work. But under a patchwork of rules, some employers might have to notify their state and local health departments.

As cases started to pop up this week, some employers began offering additional pay. Perdue said it would provide all hourly workers a $1-per-hour raise for the next several weeks. Hormel, the maker of Spam, said it would offer a $300 bonus for full-time workers and $150 for part-time associates.

On Thursday, the United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents 250,000 food processing workers, said it had negotiated additional pay and benefits increases, including a $600 bonus in May for its members at the nation’s second-largest meatpacker, JBS, which includes Pilgrim’s chicken. JBS spokesman Cameron Bruett did not answer whether the company would match that for nonunion employees.

Several large meat and poultry companies, including Tyson, Smithfield, Sanderson and Koch, have not announced raises or bonuses.

On Friday, Perdue told ProPublica it was starting to roll out temperature checks at its plants. And Bruett said JBS had set up “triage stations” outside plants to screen employees for temperature and symptoms. But it’s unclear if all employees will be tested or only those exhibiting symptoms.

Meanwhile, Venceremos, a group advocating for poultry workers in northwest Arkansas, has started a petition asking that Tyson and other processors provide paid sick leave for workers as the coronavirus begins to spread to rural America.

“Everyone is realizing that they are essential and have been essential to the country,” said Magaly Licolli, one of the group’s leaders. “And now it’s time that everybody should demand fair rights for them. That’s what we’ve been arguing all this time. They are the ones that provide for the country.”

Here’s how to send tips and documents to ProPublica securely.","In interviews this week, meat and poultry workers, some in the country without authorization, noted with irony that they have recently been labeled “essential” by an administration now facing down a pandemic.
But except for unionized plants, meat and poultry workers rarely get paid when they’re sick.
Despite the “essential” role meat and poultry workers play in the food chain, the sick-time bill signed by President Donald Trump last week doesn’t cover most meat and poultry workers because it exempts companies with more than 500 employees.
Koch Foods didn’t respond to calls and emails asking about its policies for sick workers.
The closest precedent may be immigration raids, which have temporarily shuttered meat and poultry plants periodically over the last 25 years."

100,100,"Dec 6, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Child hunger in Mississippi is real. Let's solve the food insecurity problem.,"Between the great American feast days of Thanksgiving and Christmas seems like the right time to write about child hunger. Our state has a persistent problem with hunger and food insecurity, with over half a million Mississippians regularly struggling to get enough to eat.

Hunger is especially hard on children and Mississippi still has the highest rate of food-insecure children in the US, according to Feeding America. Some regularly miss meals. About half of Mississippi households receiving SNAP federal food assistance include children.

Lynn Evans (Photo: File photo/The Clarion-Ledger)

We know that our persistent poverty is largely to blame; 50 of Mississippi’s food-insecure counties have had poverty rates of 20 percent or more for over 30 years. However, policy decisions on both the federal and state levels also affect who gets enough to eat.

A lack of accessible grocery stores plagues large parts of our state. Attempts by Senator David Blount and Rep. Jarvis Dortch in the state Legislature to get bills passed providing tax incentives for opening grocery stores in Food Deserts are regularly killed by lobbyists for the fast-food industry since people eat less fast food if there is a good grocery store nearby.

The current administration in Washington has been looking for ways to cut federal food assistance expenditures, including school lunches and SNAP. Under rules introduced under the Obama administration, all students in a public school or even all the students in a public school district can get free lunches if the percentage of low-income children qualifying for free lunch there is 40 percent or more. The 40 percent can include children on SNAP, children in foster care, and children who are homeless.

Feeding breakfast and lunch to all the children in a public school for free cuts down on paperwork and administrative costs, and makes it easier for school kitchens to provide more appetizing and nutritious meals. And it eliminates student lunch debt. According to the USDA, about 13.7 million schoolchildren attend public schools where everyone eats free. Something good to eat makes it easier for children to concentrate on learning. However, newly proposed rules by the Trump administration would make it harder to qualify for this federal funding and add paperwork.

Several Democratic candidates for president are calling for the expansion of the free school lunch program to all public school students, something that would cost about $19.6 billion a year. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, and Bernie Sanders have all proposed some version of free lunch programs for all public school students. Castro’s plan would also provide low-income students with three meals a day during summer months.

Castro further proposes federal grants to help open grocery stores in food deserts. As many small towns in this state have learned, a grocery store can be a linchpin that not only improves people’s access to fresh and nutritious food and provides good jobs, but also helps other small businesses prosper.

Although food deserts are most often found in rural areas, there are parts of Hinds County, including in Jackson, that qualify as food deserts because there are no nearby grocery stores. Add that to the fact that a full fourth of the people in Hinds County are food insecure. People in food deserts, by definition high poverty areas, can pay up to 37 percent more for the exact same produce as everybody else.

Surely we all agree that it is not good for children to go hungry. It’s not good for children’s brains or general health, or their overall sense of well-being. Children who grow up food insecure are more likely to develop diabetes, high blood pressure, have strokes, have complications during pregnancy, and get cancer.

It is not a hard fix. All it takes is the will to do it.

At least thirty-six percent of university students are food insecure, meaning they don't have reliable access to nutritious food. Colleges and universities in Mississippi are partnering to feed more students they say are missing meals. MPB's Ashley Norwood reports.



It's lunch time in the cafeteria at Tougaloo College.

Makaylah Hampton, a student at the college near Jackson, says for some this is their last meal for the day.

""If you don't have a car, you can't get to places cause the cafe closes at like 6:30 I think. Especially on Tuesday's and Thursday's cause people have longer classes because of lab. So some people don't even get out of class until like 8:30 so then you miss dinner. So now, you don't have anything to eat,"" said Hampton.

The College and University Anti-Hunger Alliance of Mississippi is a coalition of institutions and organizations across the state. They are creating food pantries accessible to students in an effort to combat hunger on college campuses.

Tougaloo College, Jackson State University and Coahoma Community College in Clarksdale have already committed to opening food pantries on campus.

Karen Done, director of student engagement at Coahoma, says there's a greater need on community college campuses. According to a national survey conducted by Wisconsin HOPE Lab, at least 42 percent of community college students are food insecure, compared to 36 percent of students attending universities.

""Majority of our students are pell-grant eligible which means that they're coming from homes where there's a financial need. And, because there's that need there's a large percentage of students who are often financially lacking and are hungry,"" said Done.

Under deals with contractors, universities have hiked meal plan prices significantly in recent years, adding to rising cost of college.

Students eat lunch at Perry Cafeteria at Mississippi State Tuesday, October 9, 2019. (Photo: Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi Today)

Editor's note: The Southern Foodways Alliance has collaborated with the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger, AL.com and Mississippi Today to shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi.

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food.Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an ""unlimited"" meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal ""swipes"" didn't roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).""

Glasper isn't alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country, and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor, Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

""Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,"" said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

Story continues below gallery.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State's operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

RELATED: Real food challenge: Auburn University, unlike peers, requires 20% local source of dining food

But contractors eventually ran out of ""ways to distinguish themselves on the service side"" when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

""Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it,"" he said.

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12 percent commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn't reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a ""campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan ""is much, much more expensive"" than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won't use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,"" Mac Dermott said of meal options. ""They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a ""food-court environment"" where managers can ""interchange menu concepts very easily,"" said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.""

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into a “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

""Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,"" said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. ""They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they're going to have access to (at home).""

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but ""we've adjusted"" to student demand. ""Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there's going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the ""Ultimate"" plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren't using the rising prices to ""pad the pocket of the institution."" She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshmen are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 ""Rebel Unlimited Plus 1"" plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract ""to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,"" said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar ""Dining Dollars"" food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama's contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid such as Pell Grants doesn't always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better about using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,"" Grant said. ""But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefits package, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there,"" he said. Eventually, it was ""ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.”

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,"" Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017.

""I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,"" he said. ""We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

105,105,"Aug 26, 2020",,Dole Packaged Foods Takes Action To Address Global Food Accessibility Challenge,"Taking action on its promise to make nutritious foods accessible for 1 billion people by 2025, Dole introduces Sunshine for All program in one of America's largest food deserts: Jackson, MS

JACKSON, Mississippi, Aug. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Delivering on ""The Dole Promise"" and to address the global food insecurity crisis that has escalated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Dole Packaged Foods today announced the Sunshine for All program, dedicated to bringing fresh and packaged produce, nutritious meals and educational opportunities to communities that need it the most. Dole chose Jackson, MS—a city with one of America's largest food deserts and only one grocery store for every 10,000 residents—to kick-start this program.

Access to healthy food is a global challenge and one that impacts thousands of U.S. cities and over 40 million people nationwide. This crisis has been further exacerbated by the growing problem of income disparity and, more recently, the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of access to full-service grocery stores, farmers' markets and other vendors that sell nutritious fruits and vegetables has created food deserts and food swamps across the country. Food deserts are defined as areas that have limited access to affordable and nutritious food. On the contrary, food swamps are areas with an abundance of fast food restaurants, convenience stores and liquor stores that primarily sell junk food.

""Our program goes beyond donations to address the critical challenges of accessibility and affordability, as well as nutrition education in communities around the world,"" said Pier Luigi Sigismondi, President of Dole Worldwide Packaged Foods. ""Jackson will serve as a blueprint for how we're going to tackle these challenges in other food deserts using a hyper-local model. Together with partners, we're building a foundation that will drive systemic change within individual communities and our society at large.""

In fact, consumers can nominate a city as Dole's next Sunshine for All location. To enter, send an email to [email protected] or post using #SunshineforAllYOURCITY via Instagram, Twitter or Facebook telling Dole what city should be should be the next stop.

Selections will be made by Dole based on need (access to fresh foods, status as a food desert or food swamp), number of posts using the hashtag and mentioning your city and quality of entry (did it address why, creativity). The second Dole Sunshine for All destination will be announced on Giving Tuesday, December 1, 2020.

Sunshine for All in Jackson

Jackson was selected because the city has only 20 grocery stores, and of those stores, less than 5 percent stock locally grown fresh produce. In contrast, there are 70 fast food restaurants, 60 convenience stores, and 150 gas stations that primarily sell unhealthy options.

To mark the program launch, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has proclaimed today Sunshine for All Day in Jackson. Along with the mayor, Dole has partnered with local chefs and organizations including the Boys and Girls Club of Central Mississippi, Up in Farms, The Urban League, Smoothie King and Foot Print Farms to creatively tackle the challenge of getting nutritious foods into underserved areas in Jackson. Key program elements include:

A $75,000 donation from Dole Packaged Foods to Up in Farms to support their Farm-to-Table Training Center and sustainably equip the commissary to provide 1,000 nutritious meals/day to those in need.

ATLANTA — The convenience-store industry plays a critical role in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by providing a handy place for economically disadvantaged citizens to buy food, RaceTrac Petroleum’s chief executive recently told members of the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture.

RaceTrac CEO Max McBrayer Jr. earlier this month testified before the Agriculture Committee that c-stores help alleviate food insecurity in the United States by providing 24-hour food access for SNAP beneficiaries, particularly those in rural areas.

RaceTrac and RaceWay c-stores provide nearly 1,700 SNAP-eligible food products at more than 750 locations in 11 states throughout the Southeast. RaceTrac’s stores, open 24 hours a day, process approximately 3 million electronic benefit transfers annually.

“No American should go hungry,” McBrayer testified. “As active partners in SNAP, we provide essential food access to the thousands of people in our communities who have come to rely on us. Our continuous and extended hours ensure that customers are always able to access our stores to purchase the food they need at any time. Together, we can fulfill the program’s goal to alleviate hunger and food insecurity across the country.”

RaceTrac’s participation in SNAP enables beneficiaries to access food without excessive inconvenience or expense, he said. Low-income Americans often work—and shop for food—during unconventional hours, and the c-store industry accommodates this. RaceTrac stores are often the only easily accessible retail food store in a particular area and are consistently open longer than other large-format food retailers, he said.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the percent of SNAP transactions at RaceTrac stores has doubled, McBrayer testified.

“COVID-19 has exacerbated what was already an unacceptable situation,” he said. “It is clear to all of us at RaceTrac that many of our guests have been struggling to make ends meet and are experiencing food insecurity. SNAP benefits are critical to ensuring that our most economically vulnerable citizens have access to the food they need.”

Deemed “essential critical infrastructure” by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), RaceTrac has remained open throughout the pandemic, providing food and fuel to the public.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mary Altaffer/AP Mary Altaffer/AP

Slightly more than 6% of American adults have received at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine — but a disproportionately small number of them are Black and Hispanic people.

""What we're seeing from the states that are currently reporting data on vaccination distribution by race and ethnicity is a consistent pattern that is really showing a mismatch between who's receiving the vaccine and who has been hardest hit by the pandemic,"" says Samantha Artiga, the director of the Racial Equity and Health Policy Program at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The group has been tracking data from the 17 states that are publicly reporting vaccination patterns by race and ethnicity, and significant disparities are emerging.

In Mississippi, 15% of vaccinations have been received by Black people, while they account for 38% of coronavirus cases and 42% of deaths in the state. In Texas, Hispanic people make up 15% of those who have been vaccinated, compared to 44% of cases and nearly half of the deaths.

Artiga notes that the data so far is both early and limited: for instance, only a small number of states are reporting race and ethnicity data right now, and the vaccine currently is available only to high-priority groups.

Nonetheless, the current patterns are ""early warning flags about potential racial disparities in access to and uptake of the vaccine,"" according to the Kaiser Family Foundation report.

Vaccine appointments often require things like Internet access, reliable transportation and flexible work schedules. That troubles Artiga.

""How many people may be left behind if those are the resources that are required to access the vaccine?"" she says.

In an interview with All Things Considered, Artiga discusses what can be done to help improve access to the vaccine. Here are excerpts.

In Washington, D.C., the health department has been narrowing vaccines sign-ups by zip code, to try to target less affluent, less white neighborhoods. Have you heard of similar efforts around the country?

We are increasingly hearing that areas are adding new vaccination sites and adopting new sign-up processes to help make the vaccine more available for people. So as you noted, D.C. is prioritizing certain wards for appointments based on some of the early data that were showing disparities and who was able to access the vaccine.

I believe there are some health systems and areas that are planning to provide appointments, based on lottery systems when vaccines become available. I'm hearing now of some mobile vaccine clinics that are going into operation to go directly into communities. And there are other areas that are also beginning to adopt this approach of targeting specific geographic areas that we know have been hardest hit by the pandemic and may have more limited resources to be able to navigate sign-up processes for vaccines.

I'm thinking about the challenge of setting up a national vaccination campaign that has to administer hundreds of millions of doses, and layering on top of that a need to make it accessible to people who might not have a vehicle, who might not have easy access to the Internet. How important is it to front load those accessibility issues if you're going to make this campaign work?

I really think the early data, and what we know about people's willingness and concerns related to the vaccine, point to the importance of having a multipronged approach that is seeking to address access barriers and provide information and education to help address people's questions and concerns.

And I think that we also can learn a lot by listening directly to communities about how and where they want to access the vaccine, where they will feel comfortable accessing the vaccine, and who they want information from about the safety of the vaccine.

109,109,"Aug 13, 2020",Civil Eats,Just What the Doctor Ordered: Produce Prescriptions are More Important—and Popular—Than Ever.,"Since 2019, the VeggieRx produce prescription program in Chicago has offered food-insecure residents with diet-related illnesses free local produce every week. Patients receive prescriptions from primary care physicians and dietitians, and can pick up a weekly bag of fruits and veggies, as well as take cooking lessons.

The program operates in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago, where the diabetes mortality rate is 62 percent higher than the national average, and it played a key role in helping residents get access to fresh, whole foods before the pandemic. Over the last five months, however, it has seen a surge in demand.

“Prior to COVID, we had about 35 to 70 weekly boxes across our three locations—and now the sites are [serving] upwards of 130 to 160 boxes per week,” says Kris Delatorre, an urban farmer at Windy City Harvest, the organization that grows produce for the VeggieRx program at three farms throughout the city.

Produce prescription programs (PPPs) like this one are designed to serve patients with chronic health issues including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, allowing them to access healthy foods at a subsidized price. Many PPPs operate through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program, which started in 1992. The numbers have skyrocketed in the last 10 years; in 2010, 36 states had programs, today, 49 states have them.

Now, with the global pandemic, existing programs have grown in scope, new programs are in the works, and research is ramping up to make sure PPPs remain economically sustainable even after COVID-19 is brought under control.

Delatorre attributes the increased usage to the health concerns of its primary clients—people with pre-existing conditions who feel a grocery store run is too risky. In response to the pandemic, the VeggieRx program now offers touch-free pickup to meet social distancing guidelines.

“It’s clear we need to pull out all the stops to help families stretch their food dollars.”

But that may not be the only reason these programs have so much appeal in the current moment. Healthy diets are known to strengthen the body’s immune response, and the immune system needs more energy when its actively battling an illness or infection. A recent study from University of Southampton, found that vitamin A (which carrots and sweet potatoes provide) and zinc (from broccoli and spinach, among other vegetables) are the most essential nutrients for successfully fighting off infection. As healthcare providers look for ways to help prevent or alleviate pre-existing conditions that often cause a more severe, if not fatal, course of the virus, PPPs are increasingly being seen as a preventative healthcare measure.

“It’s clear we need to pull out all the stops to help families stretch that food dollar wide, especially when it comes to healthy food. That’s where produce prescription programs come in,” said Sarah Reinhardt, the lead food systems and health analyst for the Food & Environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Right now it’s more important than ever. With hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 [patients], everything we can do to ensure better health is key for us to beat the impact this virus has on our society. It’s not a magic bullet, but it is an important part of the framework.”

Even so, Reinhardt and other PPP proponents wonder if the model can survive the pandemic or—better yet—grow to become a widely accepted tool for combatting diet-related illnesses.

Reaching Underserved Communities in NYC

Two of the largest barriers to a long-term healthy lifestyle are financial constraints and a lack of access to fruits and vegetables, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which found PPPs had a positive impact on patients’ rate of hypertension.

Since the pandemic began, health professionals have drawn a connection between neighborhoods with limited access to high-quality produce and those that had higher-than-average numbers of life-threatening COVID cases. In New York City, once the global epicenter of the outbreak, neighborhoods such as Far Rockaway in Queens, Flatbush in Brooklyn, and Pelham Gardens in the Bronx have seen the highest number of deaths. These are predominantly communities of color, where residents have low median household incomes, and a higher percentage of residents with pre-existing conditions than the city’s average. They all also have low enough access to healthy foods to be considered “food deserts.”

In 2017, the New York City Department of Health launched the Pharmacy to Farm PPP, partnering with pharmacies to issue coupons totaling $30 a month to residents who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and fill blood-pressure prescriptions at participating independent pharmacies. With the coupons, the patients can receive fruit and vegetables at nearby farmers’ markets.","Since 2019, the VeggieRx produce prescription program in Chicago has offered food-insecure residents with diet-related illnesses free local produce every week.

112,112,"May 31, 2020",The Guardian,'People are going to go hungry': pandemic effects could leave 54m Americans without food,"A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.

Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures.

As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year – a 63% increase compared to 2018.

Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

America’s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities.

It’s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020.

The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% – 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 – and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% – 4.8 points higher than 2018.

In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children.

Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen.

“We were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don’t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.

Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. “People are going to go hungry, that’s the truth,” said Scott.

The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year – a rise of almost 60% since 2018.

Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February.

“This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

On Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, 1,400 or so cars lined up at a mobile distribution point, which was open for three hours, for grocery boxes of canned fruits, pinto beans, pasta, milk, fresh vegetables, frozen meat and bread, to help make ends meet for a month.

Historically, there was a shortfall of 34m meals every year in the five counties served by the Community Food Bank of southern Arizona. Currently, the demand remains sky high – double pre-pandemic levels, and statewide 17% of the workforce have claimed unemployment since the start of the crisis.

“We were getting darn close to closing the meal gap before the crisis,” said Michael McDonald, the CEO. “But if demand continues at this rate for the rest of the year or into next year, we’re going to fall way short. I don’t see us being able to keep up without a longer-term commitment from the federal government.”

One in three children in Arizona could go hungry this year without food aid.

Food banks aren’t in it alone.

Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product.

In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)’s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries.

But it’s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights.

“Everything feels so unpredictable, I’ve literally no idea what’s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,” said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.

In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 – a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit. Only a tiny fraction of the USDA contracts went to distributors in New England.

As states start to reopen for business, economic recovery is expected to be painfully slow especially if further outbreaks are not adequately contained, which could trigger a full-blown second wave of the pandemic. Underemployment could last for years, which means millions of Americans are likely to need help with food, utilities and rent in the medium and long term.

Los Angeles county, where almost half the state of California’s Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, is projected to have 1.68 million food insecure people this year – the highest number in the country. It’s the most populous county in the US, with 10 million residents, where unemployment has risen to 20.3% – five percentage points higher than the state average – and food stamp applications have almost tripled compared with last year.

“If the numbers stay like this, no way food banks can cope, it’s beyond our capabilities, a lot will depend on how long federal help lasts,” said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Food Bank, which has distributed 80% more groceries since the pandemic began.

Susan King, president of Feeding Northeast Florida, agrees: “It’s when the dust settles that I’m most worried about, when the federal and state help is over but the line of people waiting for food is still long.”

King added: “This is a marathon, we can’t sugarcoat how scary it is; it absolutely keeps me up at night.”","Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

114,114,"Apr 10, 2019",Mississippi Public Broadcasting,Mississippi Delta Food Pantry Provides for Communities,"Mississippi is the most food-insecure state in the nation. One out of five people in the state does not know where their next meal will come from. MPB’s Alexandra Watts spends a day in a food pantry to see what happens when demand is larger than supply.

It’s a Saturday Morning in Charleston, and Joe Young and Faith Food Pantry volunteers are getting ready to hand out boxes of food to Tallahatchie County residents at Faith Baptist Church.

“Normally we serve 350 to 375 people,"" Young said. ""A month ago, we served over 400 on this day, and that was a record crowd — for Saturday.”

According to Feeding America, Mississippi is the most food-insecure state in the nation. Twenty percent of Mississippians lack reliable access to a sufficient quality of affordable nutritious food.

Young, a pastor, runs another food pantry at Parchman. He said food distributions are scheduled in the middle of the month on purpose.

“We do our food pantry in all locations on the third Saturday of the month,"" he said. ""[We think] when they run our food stamps, that we can be their backup. We try to help them out when their month gets longer than their check.”

Lee Fayne is one of those people. He stands outside the church and says his disability check and food stamps are not enough to cover his expenses.

""I pay the bills and when I’m done paying the bills, I probably have $48 and go buy hygiene products,"" Fayne said. ""And they send me $75 worth of food stamps which lasts up until this time of the month and then you got things you don’t have. Like, in our refrigerator we have chicken and no other meat. We have like four packs of chicken and we’re going to try and make it stretch until the end of the month.”

In the Mississippi Delta, 26 percent of people are food insecure. There aren’t a lot of grocery stores in the area and Fayne says high grocery prices prevent him from buying certain foods.

“I come and pick up a box and bring it back to the house, and it helps me quite a bit because sometimes we don’t have the other items in there, especially the cereal and the fruit. We don’t have the money to buy it.”

Inside, the volunteers fill the boxes with crackers, cookies and canned goods. The final touch added to the boxes is the meat, which today is chicken and turkey.

Jimmy Pegues says he does all he can so the food he gets lasts.

""We cook about three times a week, and other time we eat sandwiches or whatever,"" he said. ""I’m not a real big eater. I try not to waste it, we try not to waste food. Cook what you need and that’s it.”

Pegues lost his leg in an accident over 30 years ago and today he's a gardener — or as his business card says, a yard doctor.

He is one of the last to get his box of food, but signing up ahead of time will guarantee you will receive a box.

And once everyone who signed up has their box, the rest of the food is given away on a first come, first served basis.

Weeks of widespread flooding and severe weather have left many Delta residents displaced from their homes. Jeanette Jones said this has increased the demand for more food from the pantry.

“A lot of people don’t have anything,"" Jones said. ""Their house was gutted, you know, no food…and we’re planning on giving extra.”

After nearly three hours of distributing food, Joe Young announces the pantry has run out of food for the first time.

“We had such an overwhelming crowd,"" Young said. ""We were understaffed, under everything”.

Twenty-six people add their names and numbers to a waiting list before they leave to receive their boxes of food later in the week.

A soft-spoken woman named Glenda Miller comes in as the volunteers are cleaning up. She is told the pantry is out of food. But as she is about to leave, someone inside the pantry flags her down after finding extra food.

“I jumped out the car and came in here, and it was a blessing…blessing,"" she said. ""She had meat. I got chicken. I got beans, I got rice. I got practically everything I need. Thank God…God is good.”

Miller has three grandchildren and says she doesn’t know where she would have gotten food.

“It’s been quite a while since I’ve been here because I had a heart attack, so I hadn’t been able to get out to get my stuff. After I had this heart attack a couple of months, and when I finally made it here, I was just happy. Because they had stuff for me and my grandkids.”

Joe Young says although the pantry is open only once a month, he says his job of feeding Tallahatchie County goes beyond just those few hours on a Saturday. Young said they keep their cellphones by their sides day and night — ready to distribute food to anyone in need.

""I’m not sure if we’re prepared, But we’re always trying to be proactive…to be ready,"" Young said.

And while the volunteers are done for the day, they already have distributions set up for the upcoming week to help residents in need.","MPB’s Alexandra Watts spends a day in a food pantry to see what happens when demand is larger than supply.

June 10, 2020

When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

“It wasn’t, ‘Oh my gosh how are we going to teach these kids?’ It was, ‘Oh my gosh these kids are going to starve without these meals,’” said Sunny Baker, co-director of the Mississippi Farm to School Network.

Before coronavirus, schools were a dependable place for thousands of children to receive a free and nutritious breakfast and lunch. The pandemic made this service even more crucial, as school buildings closed this spring and the virus wreaked havoc on the state and the nation’s economy, putting many parents’ jobs and economic futures in peril.

In Mississippi, 75 percent of children qualify for free or reduced meals, which means they live in households with income levels between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line. Because of this, the majority of children are dependent on the free breakfast and lunch they get at school everyday. When schools abruptly closed, so did that food supply.

“We just have such a large population in Mississippi of students who depend on those meals,” said Scott Clements, state director of child nutrition at the Mississippi Department of Education. “That breakfast and that lunch is the most nutritious meal they’ll get and in some cases, the only meal they’ll get during the course of the day.”

Gov. Tate Reeves made the decision to close school buildings and switch to distance learning on March 19, which means most school districts sprung into action immediately upon their return from spring break.

In the weeks since, school nutrition departments have had to pivot to alternative methods to ensure students receive food, whether it be a grab-and-go format, school bus door stop delivery, or drive-up exchanges.

More than 4.65 million meals have been served from mid-March through April (May figures are not available yet), Clements said. On any given day during the academic year, more than 100 school districts offered grab-and-go meals at more than 350 sites, not counting the 14 nonprofits that served meals at an additional 53 sites. Schools are still serving during the summer; the number of districts and sites change daily, as schools are constantly making decisions about which locations and days of the week to continue serving while also keeping workers and families safe.

“We say that all the time during the course of the school year, we really love to see a child eat breakfast in the morning because they’re better prepared to learn that day,” Clements said. “We like to see them eat lunch because they’re not going to be hungry and distracted in the afternoon. The same goes for right now — we’re trying to do distance learning and I think it’s important to make sure the nutrition is right so that they are healthy and even though (learning) shifted to home, they’re still able to learn.”

In some cases, local school districts have stopped serving meals because of the coronavirus. The West Bolivar School District, for example, paused delivery for about a month for this reason. They were delivering meals to students along the bus route in an effort to reach kids in the most rural areas of the county. But when one of the food service staff contracted the coronavirus, the meal provisions had to stop immediately, said Jackie Lloyd, school board president.

Small towns that West Bolivar School District served like Shaw — where the only sources of food are one restaurant, two gas stations, and a Dollar General — were suddenly left to figure out how to bridge the gap of keeping kids fed.

“You go to [Dollar General] one day, the shelves are just bare. It’s a whole community of people trying to get the small amount that’s available. So it’s very hard for them, especially our elderly, to be able to survive and get adequate nutrition that they need during this time,” said Cora Jackson, who was born and raised in Shaw.

In Shaw’s case, the nonprofit Delta Hands for Hope stepped in.

“Delta Hands for Hope has been a pillar in Shaw for the past five to six years. Because our focus is on youth, there’s no way that I could not do something for these children,” said Chiquikta Fountain, executive director and sole employee of Delta Hands for Hope.

From Day One volunteers like Jackson, her husband, and a group of students showed up to assemble meals. Donors contributed money and meal boxes toward the effort. Delta Hands for Hope, which before the pandemic provided children with educational resources after school, now serves lunch to around 65 kids three days a week. Even with these efforts, they’re still not able to reach all of the children in Shaw who are enrolled in West Bolivar School District.

While the need for a reliable, nutritious food source has become a glaring issue during the time of this pandemic, the problem of food insecurity is not new.

“Food pantries are an emergency solution to a huge problem here. They’re a Band-Aid. All of this hunger talk and hunger work to me is going to be for naught if we’re not talking about changing the system in which hunger exists,” Baker, the co-director of Mississippi Farm to School Network, said.

That system in which hunger exists hinges on long-held economic policies that don’t promote the buying and selling of locally grown produce.

Mississippi’s agricultural “focus on export commodities appears to have led state officials, and educational institutions, to overlook the potential for creating new economic activity — and farm and food business ownership — through local foods,” states a report produced for the Mississippi Food Policy Council.

The same report estimates that Mississippi imports nearly 90 percent of its food, while exporting on a large scale commodity crops that have to be processed, like soybeans.

“We have this incredibly rich soil. The Mississippi Delta is the richest soil in the country. And we’re not growing food there. We’re growing commodity crops — stuff that people can’t eat,” Baker said. “We’re not supporting small scale farmers. In fact, there are many policies and legislation that prevent small farmers from doing what they need to do.”

This is just one of the factors contributing to what is commonly referred to as hunger in Mississippi. In this sense, hunger doesn’t necessarily mean starving to death. It means not knowing where the next meal will come from or not being able to access healthy, affordable food.

“There are people here who may not be starving like we see on TV where you have children who are malnourished. Starvation looks a different way. Having access to food looks totally different than what you think it does … There’s food, but it’s processed food. You may even have cooked food (from a gas station or restaurant), but you don’t know where that came from,” Fountain said.

Eddye Johnson, food service director in the Coahoma County School District, is also well aware of this problem. She knew it would be hard for students to get a nutritious meal — her concerns stemmed from the lack of healthy meals students eat rather than access to the food itself.

“A lot of these children can’t go in there and cook, so they might be hungry or eating (Ramen) noodles up until their parents come home. Every now and then I think about that. I try to do my best to make sure I do all I can to make sure each child gets a decent meal and something nutritious,” Johnson said.

On a statewide level, the department of education worked with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to secure additional funding for families. The Pandemic EBT Program (P-EBT) was passed by the federal government in March as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and gives the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture the authority to approve statewide plans for temporary assistance to ensure that “children continue to have access to nutritious meals despite this national emergency.”

To date, 41 states have been approved, Mississippi included. The program serves 340,980 students to the tune of $90 million, or about $5.40 per student per day. The funding is retroactive, meaning it would cover the time from the date schools closed due to the pandemic (March 19) through the end of the school year (May 22).

The pandemic has also changed the way food is distributed. Ensuring the safety of employees and the greater communities they serve has led some districts to go from five days a week to one or two.

Cartons of milk for each child in some cases are now gallons, so families don’t have to come back repeatedly and increase contact and exposure. Before the virus, districts may have ordered large tins of canned peaches or strawberries; now they’re distributed in single-serve cups, Clements said.

“It’s a very different process from having 800 kids come through a serving line where you’re constantly being backfilled from the kitchen,” Clements, the state nutrition director, said. “Even though the numbers may be smaller, it’s tough to feed say, 400 kids in a serving line when you’ve got to bag up everything individually, have everything ready, keep it hot or cold as the case may be, outside of the kitchen.”

In the Jackson Public School District, meals were served at 12 sites across the city on Mondays and Wednesdays during the school year. Initially the district was serving Monday through Friday, but department officials decided it was best to stick to two days for the safety of everyone involved.

“Of course maintaining safety is always a concern,” said Marc Rowe, school nutrition director at the district. “It’s always a challenge to make sure that we’re all practicing social distancing and wearing all of our protective equipment.”

JPS is using a drive-up method, where parents pull up to the sites and workers hand them the bagged meals — two on Mondays and three on Wednesdays, so families have food for the week but don’t have to come by daily.

The state’s second largest school district typically serves about 19,000 lunches and 10,000 breakfasts a day during the school year.

“We know that because of those numbers, there is a major need for students to eat breakfast and lunch even though they’re not in a traditional school setting,” Rowe said.

Since mid-March when the governor closed schools to mid-May, Rowe said the district served roughly 125,000 meals. The district returned to Monday through Friday service on June 1 until June 10 for its summer feeding program.

The Coahoma County School District, which serves almost 1,200 students, delivered 1,200 breakfast and 1,200 lunches every day on Monday through Friday. The district ended their delivery meal services two weeks ago to prepare for their summer feeding program on June 1.

Maintaining employee safety is a challenge for all districts, but for some, trying to reach as many students as possible has been the biggest barrier of all.

Wilma McIntosh, food service director in the Clarksdale Municipal School District, said the stigma of the virus and rural areas the district serves are making it difficult to reach as many students.

“Even though the advertisement is out there and we’re encouraging everyone to come, some still don’t come. They may not have transportation and some they just may be fearful with coming out,” McIntosh said.

Clarksdale Municipal schools, Coahoma’s neighboring district, served grab-and-go meals — including breakfast and lunch — for five days a week. Across three sites, over 500 students received meals daily, McIntosh said.

But, this doesn’t equate to nearly half of the 3,000 students in the district. The district usually serves 525,000 meals per year.

As a way to reach more kids, the district implemented “Wildcat on Wheels,” bussing meals to students across the town. This one-day operation ended quickly for fear of the “safety for the community and employees,” McIntosh said.

Unlike schools, the issue for the Olive Branch Food Pantry, comprising more than 20 churches and organizations, wasn’t transportation. Michele McCrory, director, said their initial issue was finding volunteers. Their usual volunteers consisted of older people. Despite social distancing measures, they felt unsafe being around others, she said. As a result, the pantry closed in April.

“It was a hard decision for us. Many pantries opened during the COVID-19 scare. We have a couple of board members who are older or take care of elderly people, so they couldn’t get around people,” McCrory said.

The pantry secured younger volunteers and reopened in May operating as a drive through. They serve about 60 boxes every week to families.

In addition to food pantries, nonprofits and community organizations helped carry the load by giving monetary relief and helping hands for meal distribution.

In Tallahatchie County, The Tutwiler Community Education Center stepped in when the local school district couldn’t provide meals. Before the coronavirus, the organization’s role has always been to support the community in times of need.

“When the storm hit (earlier this year) and people lights were out and lost food, we were able to get a donation to get 10,000 gift cards for food to support that need and fortunately, we were able to partner with organizations,” Melanie Powell, executive director of the center, said.

This time is no different except for the increasing demand of food, she said. They are now doling out more than 250 food boxes per week. At this rate, Powell says the center “will be a food bank.”

Through it’s FEED fund, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi received over $150,000 to provide meals and food boxes to food pantries, church and community organizations, and food pantries. The Maddox Foundation of Hernando and the Walton Family Foundation gave over $100,000 to assist the foundation in its efforts.

While the pandemic has undoubtedly hindered people’s ability to access basic sustenance, it doesn’t mean that it has inflamed an overwhelming sense of despair in all.

“I don’t want to keep portraying our community like we don’t still have people who have pride in this place just because of something like this,” Fountain said. “People are resilient. They find ways to bounce back. Even in this time of confusion, I encounter people who have smiles on their faces, who are happy about life. They’re grateful to be here, even in the midst of all this stuff that’s going on.”","‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemicJune 10, 2020When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

McCabe: 'Absolutely nothing' will keep this from happening again

(CNN) —

A Republican running for governor in Mississippi denied a female reporter’s request to accompany him on a campaign trip unless she brought along a male colleague, insisting Wednesday that he did so because he “just wanted to keep things professional.”

The reporter, Larrison Campbell, wrote in Mississippi Today on Tuesday that the paper had asked to shadow each gubernatorial candidate seeking the GOP nomination “in an attempt to better inform readers.” While two of the candidates agreed, state Rep. Robert Foster declined, explaining on a Mississippi talk radio show Wednesday that having a female reporter with him could create “an awkward situation.”

Campbell, who said that she was the first to report on Foster’s plans to enter the gubernatorial race in November 2018, told CNN by phone Wednesday that she was in “disbelief” when Foster’s campaign manager, Colton Robinson, told her she wouldn’t be allowed to cover the campaign by herself.

“There really wasn’t any wiggle room, there was no getting around it,” she said. “I think it was like disbelief. I don’t think it was until I hung up that I got upset by it.”

Foster told SuperTalk Mississippi radio Wednesday, “It’s a ride-along request for a 16-hour day that we were going to be on the road. The other opponents of mine got a male reporter to ride along with them, which is a little bit different situation.

“In our case it was a female reporter asking to ride along, and my campaign director is in and out and gone sometimes – we have to divide and conquer – and there was just going to be a lot of opportunities where it would’ve been an awkward situation I didn’t want to put myself in.”

Foster also defended his decision on Twitter Wednesday, citing his Christian faith as the reason he denied access to Campbell.

“As I anticipated, the liberal left lost their minds over the fact I choose not to be alone with another woman,” he said. “They can’t believe, that even in 2019, someone still values their relationship with their wife and upholds their Christian Faith.”

Campbell said Wednesday it was uncomfortable for her, as a journalist, to be thrust into a story she was covering but, after Campell spoke with her editors, the paper decided to explain why Foster would get less coverage in Mississippi Today than the other GOP candidates.

“My job is to let the readers know what is happening in Mississippi,” she said. “I felt this was a service to our readers.”

Campbell added: “If it makes people angry, if it makes people fall in love with him, that’s besides the point. I sort of see this as a part of the public service of the job.”

Campbell also warned against the assumption that her denied access to Foster’s campaign is a “Mississippi story,” positing Wednesday that women everywhere are “sexualized” as they try to do their jobs.

“I don’t think this is a Mississippi story,” she said. “I think it’s a universal story.”

The Foster campaign did not respond to CNN’s request for comment Wednesday. His campaign website describes him as a “man of faith” and “conservative outsider.”

117,117,"May 26, 2019",TwinCities.com-Pioneer Press,Apartment proposal at former Island Station power plant promises Mississippi River access,"Ryan Swingruber said he has big plans for the former Island Station site in St. Paul, but not too big.

The 10-acre parcel of land bordering the Mississippi River near Shepard Road and Randolph Avenue has sat vacant since 2014, and previously was home to a coal-fired power plant decommissioned in the 1970s.

By September, he hopes to break ground on three and four stories of rental housing — a mix of micro, studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.

Working with a series of environmental consultants and architects, the Chicago-area developer drew up plans for 250 market-rate apartments, stepped back from the river.

Swingruber’s vision, set within a federal “Opportunity Zone,” calls for a multi-family housing complex that he said will increase rather than block river access.

Those plans include paved walking and biking paths to an inlet, a proposed public kayak launch and connections from the regional trail system along Randolph Avenue.

“From there, they’ll be able to traverse the peninsula,” said Swingruber, who has been meeting with Xcel Energy, which owns land on either side of the future development. “We want to make it public, with defined access and signage.”

The West 7th/Fort Road Federation voted to support the project’s conditional-use permit in March, but also included a letter to the city’s zoning committee raising two concerns. The federation sought deeper assurances the project would include improved public access to the river, and raised questions about the lack of affordable units.

“The Federation Board is being asked, once again, to support a market-rate housing project in our district,” said the letter, signed by board president Dana DeMaster. “We have a need for affordable housing, especially for families and for elderly persons, and this project proposal will not meet that need.”

She noted that the West Seventh neighborhood has among the highest average rents in St. Paul, and experienced a 17 percent increase in rental costs since 2010.

Real World Economics: A Texas-sized energy debacle Swingruber said he’s also met with the Friends of the Mississippi River and, in response to their concerns, the building height will drop from four to three stories nearest the riverfront.

“We’ve seen some past development proposals that haven’t gone anywhere,” said Colleen O’Connor Toberman, river corridor program director with Friends of the Mississippi River. “From what we’ve seen of the developer’s plans, there are some nice components of community access to the riverfront, and we do appreciate that aspect of the plan.”

ISLAND STATION BLOWN APART

The site was once home to the Island Station coal-based power plant, an unofficial St. Paul landmark that drew its share of cheers and jeers before it was blown to smithereens.

At St. Paul City Hall, efforts to declare the decommissioned 1920s-era power plant a local historic site deadlocked with a tie vote before the city council in 2013, sealing its fate. Developers literally exploded the iconic but decrepit structure the following March.

As the 280-feet-tall metal smokestack collapsed into debris, hopes for new residences, retailers and other fresh real estate gained some ground.

Fast forward five years, and no one has built anything. After nearly 45 years in limbo, however, the Island Station property has once again caught the eye of a prospective buyer.

Swingruber, a vice president with the Stoneleigh Cos. of Barrington, Ill., hopes to add housing to the site under the title Waterford Bay. This will be the first Twin Cities development for the company, which has apartment properties throughout Texas.

On Thursday, the St. Paul Planning Commission’s zoning committee reviewed a request from the Stoneleigh Cos. to construct the 45-feet-tall apartment complex. Anything above 35 feet triggers the need for a conditional-use permit.

In addition, the main entrance would be situated facing the river on the east side of the property, rather than in the third of the building closest to Randolph Avenue, as currently required.

The developer has also proposed a fire access road and storm sewers in the floodway plain, as well as variances for a front yard setback.

Swingruber said the building will be set back 100 feet from the river, rather than 50, as presently required, in respect for the proposed river setbacks in the city’s draft 2040 Comprehensive Plan. It will be three stories tall closest to the river, and four stories closer to Randolph Avenue, creating a stepped-back approach from the waterfront.

The “Traditional Neighborhood” or “T2” zoning would allow a maximum of 375 housing units, but Swingruber plans to build two-thirds as many units so as not to overwhelm the site.

Given the site’s history as a coal-fired plant, the project will require carefully addressing contaminated soils. Swingruber said he’s worked closely with environmental consultants Braun Intertec, design engineering consultants Kimley-Horn and architects with the BKV Group.

The site sits within a federally designated “Opportunity Zone,” which allows certain tax benefits for investors who hold onto properties for at least 10 years.

In an interview, city council member Rebecca Noecker said she looked forward to a briefing from St. Paul Planning and Economic Development.

FALSE STARTS

A previous developer, T.J. Hammerstrom, once planned 240 units of townhomes and condominiums on the site and in an adjoining eight-story building, which were never constructed.

In late 2014, after the power plant was demolished, Breckner River Development of Burnsville sold the site to Riverwalk of Scottsdale, Ariz., for $4.5 million.

119,119,"Sep 29, 2020",The Hill,It's now up to health systems to solve our food problems,"The whole world is getting fat,"" declared Whole Foods founder, John Mackey, in a recent interview with the New York Times. Because, he continues, ""in some sense, we are all food addicts."" Mackey explains that he does not think we have a food access problem, but rather a market demand problem. ""If people want different foods, the market will provide it.""

While this perspective ignores the rising wave of food insecurity across the nation, creates a false narrative of choice where there is often none and dismisses the complex relationship between food, obesity and trauma, we can't dismiss Mackey's comment outright.

He's right about one thing. He said: ""We have to recognize both what business can do and what business cannot do."" Stores like Whole Foods are unlikely to help households struggling to access healthy food. It's now up to health systems to play a significant role in solving our food problems.

Food insecurity is defined by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" Researchers estimate that during our spring COVID-19 surge, food insecurity rates doubled nationally and tripled in households with children; approximately 23 percent of households across the country currently have inadequate access to sustenance.

The relationship between COVID-19 and food insecurity is not merely that the former drives the latter. Food insecurity is associated with increased risk and poorer control of chronic diseases, which consistently have been shown to put individuals with COVID-19 infection at higher risk of complications and death. While chronic diseases have long been the leading drivers of premature death, COVID-19 takes all of our chronic diseases and makes them acute.

As with COVID-19 infection, the burden of food insecurity falls disproportionately on low-income and Black and Latinx households. Some of the highest rates of food insecurity are seen among undocumented immigrants; a recent MIRA survey found 78 percent of households with at least one undocumented family member did not have enough to eat.

Access to healthy foods is further restricted by food deserts, neighborhoods without grocery stores, and food swamps, neighborhoods saturated with fast food. To say this landscape is a result of the market disregards the policies that have stacked the deck towards our unhealthy food system: government subsidies for ingredients of processed, energy-dense foods such as corn, soybeans, dairy and livestock instead of fruits and vegetables. What we eat is impacted by availability and cost; decreasing these barriers changes our choices for the better.

Nutritional interventions can prevent, improve and even reverse chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Diet is one of the most important modifiable risk factors of chronic non-communicable disease, according to the WHO. This is why simply put, food is medicine. Acknowledging food insecurity's outsized role in driving poor nutrition and chronic disease necessitates prioritizing healthy food access for all in our response to our worsening food insecurity crisis.

Increasingly, we understand that trauma influences our food and our health. Last summer, a friend of mine became a vegetarian. That same summer, a family member of hers was murdered. Sitting under a large umbrella at a work pool party, we talked about how she was doing. ""Not great,"" she admitted, waving her hamburger with one hand. ""I feel anxious all the time. And as you can see, my vegetarianism is out the window. I just… crave meat.""

In the setting of the COVID pandemic, we can all likely readily agree that stress influences our bodies and food cravings. And chronic trauma and stress, particularly during childhood, has a lasting influence on our neurobiology, stress hormones, food choices and weight. Increasingly, research recognizes a significant link between adverse childhood events (ACEs) and a range of chronic medical conditions including obesity. For these patients, offering a nutritional intervention alone is insensitive and will not work.

Health systems are well poised to play a strategic part in fixing our food problems due to their proximity to communities, central responsibility in treating chronic disease, the inclusion of mental health and participation in value-based payment models that incentivize addressing patients' health-related social needs such as food.

Masshealth, the Medicaid insurance product for low-income individuals in Massachusetts, has created one of the first programs to allow health systems to partner with social service organizations and provide nutritional interventions — i.e. healthy food — on their dollar with its 149 million dollar Flexible Services Program.

Health systems ready to incorporate nutritional interventions can reference the Food is Medicine pyramid, created by Food is Medicine MA, which provides a helpful schema of evidence-based programs.

For example, nutritious food referrals, which provide vouchers for free or discounted nutrient-dense food, have been shown to improve fruit and vegetable intake, improve diabetic control and improve Body Mass Index. The most intensive program, medically tailored meals, provides prepared meals tailored to a patient's medical conditions. Medically tailored meals have been shown to reduce ED visits by 70 percent, reduce inpatient hospital admissions by 50 percent and to reduce net healthcare costs by 14 percent.

Some may say it is not in scope for health systems to provide food for their patients. But the persistent long lines at food pantries and rise of community fridges are clear indications that we need more widespread solutions. As Congress has demonstrated by failing to renew Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, our government will not provide solutions anytime soon. Public assistance programs such as WIC, SNAP and school lunches are helpful but insufficient; eligibility and authorization requirements pose barriers to enrollment, particularly for immigrant populations.

Health systems are already increasingly harnessing available resources to tackle food insecurity for their communities. A trauma-informed food is medicine approach that has the power to transform our disease-oriented system into a health system; it's time we fully embrace it.

The historic Covid-19 pandemic has created an increased need for donations to The University of Southern Mississippi’s Eagle’s Nest food pantry located on the Hattiesburg campus.

In response to that dilemma, a trio of University organizations – Sigma Alpha Lambda, Association of Office Professionals and Staff Council – united to generate awareness of the pantry’s plight. Over the past several months, the groups have become directly involved in collecting and delivering contributions for the pantry.

“We could not have maintained the pantry operations without the assistance of these organizations,” said Eagle’s Nest Adviser Dr. Tamara Hurst, associate professor in USM’s School of Social Work. “They worked with us throughout the summer and into the fall. Members worked in the pantry and delivered food to students who were unable to come to campus. The pantry relies on community support and volunteers to stay open. It means everything to us to receive this support.”

Located in the basement of The Hub on the Hattiesburg campus, The Eagle’s Nest provides food, hygiene items, school supplies and other assorted products to students and staff. Only a current Southern Miss identification card is needed to access the pantry.

Hurst notes that the pantry’s primary needs include shelf-stable items such as dried or canned beans, rice, fruits, vegetables and meats.

“We always welcome fresh fruits, vegetables and bread,” said Hurst. “Gently-used cookware and eating utensils are always in demand, particularly with student in off-campus apartments.”

Since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted across the country in March, the Eagle’s Nest has experienced an increased demand from staff and international students, in particular. Jennifer Lewis, Assistant Director of Compliance and Ethics at USM, serves as the Vice President for Community Service for Sigma Alpha Lambda. She is also an Eagle’s Nest board member. Lewis says the relentless pandemic has produced immense strain on charity venues such as the Eagle’s Nest.

“In these unprecedented times, we are concerned that our most vulnerable populations, i.e. some of our staff whose spouses may not have been able to return to work or missed work during earlier quarantine phases are playing catch-up and our students, especially our international students who cannot work off-campus continue to suffer from food insecurity due to the period of time during which they were not able to work on campus,” said Lewis.

Childhood should be a time when our nation’s youngest citizens develop into the adults who will care for and lead our country, our world, and our shared future. Every child deserves love, care and protection so they can develop to their full potential. Yet for millions of children in the United Sates – and hundreds of millions more children around the world – childhood is ending too soon.

In its 2020 U.S. Complement to the Global Childhood Report, Save the Children takes a closer look at the major reasons why childhoods are ending too soon as measured by five factors. The End of Childhood State Ranking shows which states are succeeding, and which ones are failing, to provide conditions that nurture and protect children, including 5-year-old Khloe’s home state of Mississippi.

Sadly, Mississippi is the second-worst state for children in the nation. The state has the nation’s highest rate of children dying before their first birthday: 8.5 deaths per 1,000 live births– well above the national average of 5.6.

The coronavirus pandemic has made these inequalities all the more stark.

For the millions of families like Khloe’s, the effects of this pandemic on their ability to access food, healthcare, and basic services can be crippling and even deadly. Khloe’s grandmother, Sharon, says it’s been hard to keep the Kindergartener motivated to do her school assignments.

“Why did this happen? When is COVID going to leave,” she asks her grandmother.

Lack of food has also been a problem for families where Khloe and her grandmother live in Bolivar County, especially those who relied on school lunches. In fact, 30 million children in the U.S. depend on school for one or more of their meals each week.

At the beginning of the stay-at-home order, Khloe’s school district gave out “grab-and-go” lunches, but later they stopped the service out of concern for staff safety.

In nearby Coahoma and Quitman counties, parents and grandparents who have lost jobs and child care services said they felt “stressed,” “overwhelmed” and “anxious.” They described their children as “confused,” “lonely” and “depressed.”

“It’s hard to keep food in the home because of unemployment,” said Kimberly, a mother of two teenagers who lost her job when the nearby casino was closed.","Underlying Disparities Mean Mississippi’s Kids Are Hit Hard by COVID-19Childhood should be a time when our nation’s youngest citizens develop into the adults who will care for and lead our country, our world, and our shared future.

124,124,"Sep 15, 2020",Food & Wine,Fannie Lou Hamer's Pioneering Food Activism Is a Model for Today,"Food systems in the United States are in turmoil. What little progress the country has made on race relations and combating police brutality is crumbling before us. In many ways, the United States today doesn’t look much different than it did when voting and women’s rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was fighting against those same injustices with her Food Farm Cooperative. Until her death in 1977, Hamer, who co-founded the Freedom Democratic Party and National Women’s Political Caucus, used food as a political weapon to protest against systemic oppression.

Established in 1967, the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC) was an act of resistance. The idea was to provide African Americans with a path to economic opportunity and access to nutritious food that had been systematically denied to them due to white power structures. The United States Department of Agriculture routinely rejected African-American farmers’ loans for land, or imposed other policies that caused African-American farmers to lose their land, nationwide. As a result, many were forced to become sharecroppers or do other forms of low-wage work to survive. This was just one of many examples of the federal government intentionally preventing African Americans from attaining wealth or a living wage during the Jim Crow era. Over the past century, Black farmers lost approximately 12 million acres of farmland in the Delta area alone. It is estimated that 6 million of those acres were lost between 1950 to 1964.

Located in Ruleville, Mississippi, in rural Sunflower County, Hamer's Freedom Farm Cooperative and pig bank was part of a larger plan to address the increasing poverty faced by area residents. “I think there was a lot of respect for her, especially when she started working with white folks and the word got out that she didn’t give a damn who you were, if your children were hungry, you could be involved,” said Reverend Jeff Goldstein, a community organizer, and activist who worked with Hamer on Mississippi Delta grassroots civil rights movements.

Thanks to the help of singer and activist Harry Belafonte and the charitable group Measure for Measure in Madison, Wisconsin, Hamer was able to purchase the initial 40 acres in Sunflower County to create the FFC. “If you give a hungry man food, he will eat it,” Hamer said. “[But] if you give him land, he will grow his own food.”

The FFC had three main goals: addressing and enriching the nutritional needs of African Americans; creating access to affordable housing; and fostering entrepreneurship opportunities. In exchange for a few hours of work, families could take home a bushel of produce from the farm. This allowed over 1,500 families to sustain themselves by growing cash crops and vegetables such as snap peas, butter beans, squash, peas, and cucumbers. It also further reinforced the idea that the person who owns the land owns the food.

Hamer ensured affordable housing on the land with the construction of 200 homes, some of which are still standing today in Ruleville. Via the FFC, she provided financial assistance to thousands of rural people from Mississippi to purchase homes with running water and heat, which was previously inaccessible to much of the county’s population. Cash crops such as cotton and soybeans were grown to pay for taxes and overhead. Families were charged one dollar per month to use the service. This nominal fee was so much of a burden for many that only 30 families could afford it. Hamer believed that FFC's collective land ownership meant control of the food and would bring them a step closer to political freedom

FFC was also home to a Head Start program, commercial kitchen, community gardens, and a garment factory that assisted African Americans who had been fired and/or evicted for exercising their right to vote. Sharecroppers and tenant farmers alike were afforded education and retraining opportunities in healthcare and disaster relief.

With many of Sunflower's residents trying to flee racism and the prejudices of the Jim Crow South, the FFC opened the door to self-sufficiency. The region was also suffering from a continued population loss to the North, Midwest, and West as a result of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which triggered the Great Migration. Starvation was one of many strategies used to prevent African Americans from voting. Policies enforced by Mississippi congressman Jamie Whitten of the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee worked counter to the USDA’s efforts to bring more food programs to the state. Hindering marginalized people from access to these programs further exacerbated malnutrition in the state. This was clearly in retaliation for Hamer and people like her who continued to register and encourage African Americans to vote.

Continued oppression from politicians and racism forced many African Americans to leave their low wage domestic and agricultural jobs and seek employment in northern cities. Landowners made rent so high for sharecroppers and tenant farmers that most were barely surviving. African American workers had to choose between their right to vote and their existence. Exercising their right to vote meant paying for grossly expensive tests that were often financially out of reach, losing employment, and in some cases risking bodily harm or death.

The promise of better living conditions, educational and employment opportunities, as well as the widespread transition away from manual labor and towards more sophisticated farming, lured many Southerners to northern cities and west to California. The transition to farm machinery was also a driving force after generations of exploiting African Americans for their skilled labor.

FFC's collective model was a threat to the existing white hierarchy and the political and economic control that kept African American residents in poverty. This cooperative approach helped to stave off a second wave of migration to the North. It allowed African Americans who wished to remain in the Mississippi Delta a chance to create a healthy community with access to an alternative food system.

A year after the creation of the FFC, Hamer purchased another 640 acres, and the pig bank was born. Thanks to a donation from the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), Hamer was able to buy five male pigs, Jersey boars, and 50 female pigs, Yorkshire gilts. To welcome the pigs, she threw a party complete with dancing, eating, singing, and handshaking. Hamer believed that as long as people had a pig, they would not starve to death.

The Sunflower Pigs, as they were called, were delivered to a breeding barn built by local women who were often the more experienced farmers and had the skills to manage the farm. The gilts were loaned out to families where they would return piglets to the bank as interest. These families would butcher the pigs once they reached an acceptable weight.

This allowed families to go upwards of a year without purchasing store-bought ham and lard from the nearby plantation commissary. By its second year, 100 families had slaughtered pigs, frozen meat, and roasted pork. This brought a sense of pride and was a confirmation of the resilience of the Black women and men who were responsible for steering this initiative.

Despite having the help of civil rights activists, celebrities, and non-profit organizations, the FFC began to fall apart in 1974. The cooperative didn't have a strong framework to realize its long term potential and fulfill its promise. Donors became frustrated due to lack of acknowledgement, and eventually, partner organizations such as the NCNW withdrew their support. The farm wasn't financially stable, even though it was feeding and nourishing the community. In 1976, due to Hamer's fading health from breast cancer and increasing financial strain, the FFC was shuttered.","In many ways, the United States today doesn’t look much different than it did when voting and women’s rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was fighting against those same injustices with her Food Farm Cooperative.

OXFORD, Miss. – As University of Mississippi students resume classes for the spring semester, they are sharing the campus’ sidewalks with a fleet of robots that can deliver meals at the push of a button.

Starship Technologies, the world’s leading autonomous delivery service, has launched robot food delivery services at the university, the first in the Southeastern Conference to have autonomous delivery robots.

Beginning today (Jan. 22), Ole Miss students, faculty and staff can access the Starship Deliveries app (iOS and Android) to order food and drinks to be delivered anywhere on campus, within minutes from any of the 30 robots serving UM. The service will work in conjunction with student meal plans.

“Ole Miss Dining is focused on the continued utilization of advanced technology to enrich the student, faculty and staff dining experience,” said Chip Burr, resident district manager of Ole Miss Dining Services. “We are excited about the expansion of our mobile ordering operation and the new opportunities this partnership creates.”

By making food and drink more accessible, the Starship robots save time and reduce stress, aiming to make the busy lives of the Ole Miss community a little easier, Burr said.

Items can be ordered from Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, McAlister’s, Panda Express, Which Wich, Qdoba, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Raising Cane’s, Steak ‘n Shake, Freshii, Papa John’s and Sambazon. After choosing their items, users select their location by dropping a pin on the campus map where they want their food delivered.

The app allows users to watch the robot’s journey in real time through an interactive map. Once the robot arrives, the user will receive an alert and can meet the robot and unlock it through the app.

The delivery usually takes just minutes, depending on the menu items ordered and the distance the robot must travel. The robots can carry up to 20 pounds.

Starship Technologies operates commercially on a daily basis around the world. Its robots have traveled more than 350,000 miles and completed some 100,000 autonomous deliveries.

The robots use a combination of sophisticated machine learning, artificial intelligence and sensors to travel on sidewalks and navigate around obstacles. The computer vision-based navigation helps the robots to map their environment to the nearest inch. They can cross streets, climb curbs, travel at night and operate in both rain and snow.

A team of humans also can monitor their progress remotely and take control if needed.

“We’re honored to be able to help make lives a little bit easier for Rebels across the Ole Miss campus by offering the world’s leading autonomous delivery service” said Ryan Tuohy, senior vice president of business development at Starship. “Whether it’s getting breakfast delivered in the morning or having a late-night snack, our robots are here to serve students, faculty and staff at all times of the day.”","Starship Technologies, the world’s leading autonomous delivery service, has launched robot food delivery services at the university, the first in the Southeastern Conference to have autonomous delivery robots.

For some, grocery stores are far away, and farmer’s markets are nonexistent. But there are things communities can do to help.

Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible. In Mississippi, Dr. Kenya Cistrunk said nearly every county has pockets of desert areas.

“So when you think about Mississippi, and how rural our state is then you obviously we have to acknowledge that there are some areas that will not have access to supermarkets. How do we make sure that people who are in those areas have access to healthy food options,” said Cistrunk?

Some retailers are changing their business models – expanding into rural areas and offering some grocery options.

“Just to have something right here to grab bread, eggs, household, it means the world we are grateful to have the Dollar General here,” said Shirley Moore Blakley.

But even though these stores have some benefits, they also pose some challenges.

“When you think about someone who’s hungry and trying to get food, if I can get to Dollar General and purchase that frozen meal or the canned food at a price that works with my budget, then at least it gets me something. Where we want to get people to understand that those might not be the healthiest options and how do we help them learn those skills and techniques that they may not know, to grow their own vegetables and fruit,” said Cistrunk.

Cistrunk said it will take a broader approach to help those facing food insecurity.

“We’re talking about from a community level, not just individuals but from a community, level addressing food insecurity, through the community gardens, through the community-supported agricultural a model. Where people can purchase, you know food bags, if they have the funds or use their EBT benefits to go to the farmers market to be able to purchase the foods that they need,” said Cistrunk.

The State of Campus Dining: For 2019, the Southern Foodways Alliance (SFA), an institute of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, has explored the labor of food through symposia, films, podcasts, and other media. The SFA collaborated with AL.com, the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today to produce interlocked stories. Together, they shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi — the largest public universities in Alabama and Mississippi.

by Aallyah Wright for Mississippi Today and Luke Ramseth for Mississippi Clarion Ledger | October 16, 2019

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food. Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an “unlimited” meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal “swipes” didn’t roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).”

Glasper isn’t alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

“Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,” said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and the The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State’s operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

But contractors eventually ran out of “ways to distinguish themselves on the service side” when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

“Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it.” — Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12% commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn’t reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a “campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations, and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan “is much, much more expensive” than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won’t use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,” Mac Dermott said of meal options. “They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a “food-court environment” where managers can “interchange menu concepts very easily,” said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands, such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.”

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into an “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

“Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,” said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. “They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they’re going to have access to (at home).”

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but “we’ve adjusted” to student demand. “Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there’s going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the “Ultimate” plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren’t using the rising prices to “pad the pocket of the institution.” She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshman are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 “Rebel Unlimited Plus 1” plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract “to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,” said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar “Dining Dollars” food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama’s contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid, such as Pell Grants, don’t always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Eric J. Shelton/Mississippi Today, Report For America Students eat lunch at Perry Cafeteria at Mississippi State Tuesday, October 9, 2019. Credit: Eric J. Shelton/Mississippi Today, Report For America

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,” Grant said. “But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

Johnson Commons, at the University of Mississippi Monday, October 7, 2019. Credit: Eric J. Shelton/Mississippi Today, Report For America

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefit packages, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there…” Eventually, it was “ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.” — Joshua Taylor, former Ole Miss athletics cook

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks, impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,” Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017. “I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,” he said. “We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

These stories ask questions about worker compensation and benefits, university revenue models, and the relationship between universities and the corporate food service provider Aramark. On October 25, during the Southern Foodways Symposium on the University of Mississippi campus, reporters from the project will discuss their findings.

131,131,"Dec 20, 2019",Jackson Free Press,City to Provide 500 Meals to Jackson Children Over Holidays,"Several local nonprofits will unite this holiday season to provide 500 free meals to young people in Jackson as part of ongoing efforts to fight food insecurity in the city and state, which currently ranks first nationwide in food insecurity.

On Dec. 23, the Jackson Meals Matter program team up with Chefs for the Culture and the Love JXN: Save Ourselves campaign to cook and distribute hot meals at the Grove Park Community Center in northwest Jackson. The event, titled ""Holiday Meals for Jackson's Kids,"" will begin at 11 a.m. and end at 2 p.m.

As the poorest state in America, food insecurity is especially profound in Mississippi. Approximately 600,840 Mississippians, or one in four people, do not have access to enough food. One-quarter of children in the state and more than half of Mississippi's elderly population go to sleep hungry.

In Hinds County alone, 61,720 people go without enough food. As the Mississippi Food Network points out, the food-insecure population of Hinds County is larger than the hungry population in all of North Dakota.

Food insecurity is linked to numerous adverse health effects. For children, lack of access to nutrient-rich foods can lead to developmental problems and poor educational outcomes. Because unhealthy foods tend to be cheaper than nutrient-rich ones, families who are struggling to make ends meet are more likely to consume foods that harm their physical health. And since families must often decide between placing food on the table or meeting their other basic needs, food insecurity has also been linked to housing and transportation insecurity and lack of access to medical care.

Summers and holiday vacations are particularly difficult times for families struggling with food insecurity, as school breakfasts and lunches are the only times that a child may eat during the day. Mississippi ranks 47th in the country for child participation in school summer lunch programs, the Food Research and Action Center reports. Only 8% of Mississippi kids ages 18 and younger are currently enrolled in summer lunch programs.

The average cost of a meal in Mississippi is $2.93, the nonprofit Feeding America found. The agency estimates that an additional $286,997,000 in funds is required to overhaul food insecurity in Mississippi.

In 2018, the City of Jackson received a $120,000 grant from the National League of Cities to combat hunger. The City used the money to launch the Jackson Meals Matter program.

132,132,"Jul 3, 2019",Vox,Mississippi is forbidding grocery stores from calling veggie burgers “veggie burgers”,"It’s been a good few months for the plant-based meat movement — so good that opponents of the fledgling industry are starting to mobilize.

This week, a new law went into effect in Mississippi. The state now bans plant-based meat providers from using labels like “veggie burger” or “vegan hot dog” on their products. Such labels are potentially punishable with jail time. Words like “burger” and “hot dog” would be permitted only for products from slaughtered livestock. Proponents claim the law is necessary to avoid confusing consumers — but given that the phrase “veggie burger” hasn’t been especially confusing for consumers this whole time, it certainly seems more like an effort to keep alternatives to meat away from shoppers.

“The plant-based meat alternative category is on fire right now, with consumers demanding healthier and more sustainable options,” Michele Simon, the executive director of the Plant-Based Foods Association, said in a statement. “This law, along with similar laws in several other states, is the meat lobby’s response.”

The makers of meat alternatives are suing. In a lawsuit filed on July 2, they argue that since their products are already labeled “vegan,” no consumers are confused. If anything, the requirement that they avoid product descriptions like “veggie burger” makes things more confusing.

“There is no evidence that consumers are confused by plant-based bacon or veggie burger labels, and federal laws are already in place that prohibits consumer deception,” said Jessica Almy, director of policy at the Good Food Institute, an organization that works on expanding access to plant-based foods. “This law is a tremendous overstep of state powers.”

And that’s not the only problem. Food scientists are working right now on cell-based meat products, which are identical to meat from animals but grown from stem cells in a factory. Those products (which aren’t on the market yet) are meat in every relevant sense — most importantly, anyone with an allergy to meat will experience an allergic reaction to the products, and the items must be stored, refrigerated, and handled as meat. But under Mississippi’s current law, it’d be illegal to disclose that on the label.

This legal fight matters. Labeling laws like these have been discussed around the country, and courts will soon debate whether they’re constitutional. At the same time, federal regulators are looking to the states for cues about labeling laws for plant-based meat. Aggressive prohibitions could slow the growth of plant-based alternatives, which are badly needed.

The plant-based meat backlash is here

“This bill will protect our cattle farmers from having to compete with products not harvested from an animal,” said Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation president Mike McCormick in January when the bill passed in the Mississippi state House.

Mississippi isn’t the first state to consider this. Missouri passed the first such labeling law last year, and it was challenged in court by groups including the Good Food Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that such a “content-based, overbroad, and vague” restriction on the language companies could use to describe their products was unconstitutional. The lawsuit is now in settlement talks.

Dozens of other states have considered similar laws since then. The laws are popular with farmers and ranchers, who see their business model threatened by the rising popularity of plant-based meat.

That backlash might seem premature. While plant-based meat is certainly rising in popularity, all plant-based meat products still account for only a tiny fraction of the demand for meat. And plant-based alternatives aren’t changing the meat industry yet: Demand for meat actually grew last year.

But plant-based meat advocates hope — and sellers of conventional meat fear — that someday, that might change. A more climate-conscious population is increasingly bothered by the carbon footprint and land use problems associated with conventional meat production, and economies of scale may enable plant-based meat alternatives to be more competitive on price. While that day is far off, and still quite speculative, the possibility has clearly spurred lobbyists to action.

The free speech argument

But is that action constitutional? Past court decisions suggest it might not be.

Federal laws prohibit labeling food in ways that are deceptive to consumers. You can’t call a product gluten-free if it isn’t, of course, or call it “olive oil” if it’s not made from olives. When laws have tried to push beyond that, they’ve generally met a skeptical audience in the courts.

In a California case, the courts ruled that a claim that terms like “soy milk” and “almond milk” would confuse consumers was nonsense. “The crux of the claims is that a reasonable consumer might confuse plant-based beverages such as soymilk or almond milk for dairy milk, because of the use of the word “milk,” the USDistrict Court for the Northern District of California wrote, dismissing the case. “The claim stretches the bounds of credulity. Under Plaintiffs’ logic, a reasonable consumer might also believe that veggie bacon contains pork, that flourless chocolate cake contains flour, or that e-books are made out of paper.”

A Florida case directly examined free speech rights as they apply to food labels. Skim milk is routinely fortified with vitamin A (which prevents blindness, and which is removed in the skimming process). A law in Florida prohibited producers of milk and milk products from selling their products if the vitamin A was left out, demanding that milk without added vitamin A be called “imitation skim milk.” A small Florida milk producer sued, arguing that their product was skim milk and that they should have the right to label it that way. The courts sided with the milk producer.

Does it even make sense to say that a creamery or Tofurky manufacturer has a right to free speech? The answer is yes. The First Amendment can be applied to commercial speech — though the law is a bit complicated. In the 1940s, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there were no First Amendment protections for purely commercial speech. By the 1970s, the Court had reconsidered that, and overturned it in 1976.

In 1980, the Court supplied the rules for First Amendment protections on commercial speech that are still applied today. Those rules are called the “Central Hudson” test, because they were laid out in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company v. Public Service Commission of New York.

Here are the rules: First, commercial speech “must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.” Supporters of Mississippi’s law might argue that the term “plant-based burger” is misleading, while opponents argue that consumers know perfectly well what a veggie burger is.

“There’s nothing misleading about the name of a veggie burger, or vegan hot dog, or seitan bacon,” Almy, a lawyer on the Missouri case, told me. “The packages clearly disclose that this is plant-based food that has the taste or texture of this familiar food.”

Even if the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, the government can still regulate it. But it has to meet the following standards: The government must have a “substantial interest” at stake, the regulation must “directly and materially advance the government’s substantial interest,” and “the regulation must be narrowly tailored.”

There’s a strong case that bans on “veggie burger” and “tofu sausage” labels don’t meet this standard. “There’s considerable evidence that the motivation for this law is protecting cattle farmers from competition,” Almy told me. That wouldn’t be considered a substantial state interest, and banning not just words like “beef” and “pork” but also ones like “burger” and “sausage” runs a risk of the conclusion that the law isn’t narrowly tailored. “There are lots of ways to make sure that consumers are clear on what they’re buying without banning whole categories of words,” Almy pointed out.

If Mississippi’s law is found unconstitutional, that’ll be good news for consumers. There is no sign they’re being tricked by the increasing prominence of plant-based burgers — if anything, they often seem to be seeking them out.

Local and national artists, landscape architects, filmmakers, farmers, chefs, nutritionists, and community members will be invited to collaborate on a citywide exhibition featuring installations and performances, as well as other programming.

The initiative will activate public streets, community gardens, a local elementary school, and a vacant building, which will be converted into exhibition space and a food lab with a pop-up kitchen, to address challenges stemming from the proliferation of fast food restaurants in the area. According to the Clarion-Ledger, many areas of Jackson are considered food swamps where there is almost no access to grocery stores. Due to the overabundance of fast food, the city has the second highest obesity rate in the nation and the highest rate for children between the ages of ten and seventeen.

“The city is overjoyed to have been selected in this process,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement. “This was a highly competitive grant where over two hundred cities around the world applied to be a part of this Public Art Challenge. And so, to be able to aid in the aesthetic appeal of the city while delivering a message of healthy eating for the citizens of Jackson is a truly remarkable opportunity and we are ecstatic and look forward to seeing this project come into fruition.”

Among those participating in the project are artists Adrienne Domnick and Kara Walker; filmmakers Keegan Kuhn and Roderick Red; Mark Bittman, the country’s first food-focused op-ed columnist for the New York Times and a faculty member of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health; chef Nick Wallace; clean eating advocate Ron Finley; and landscape architect Walter Hood.

In February, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited mayors of US cities with thirty thousand residents or more to submit proposals for temporary public art projects that address important civic issues. Earlier this month, Anchorage, Alaska, was the first city to be announced as a winner in the 2018 Public Art Challenge for “SEED Lab,” followed by Coral Springs in partnership with Parkland, Florida, for “Inspiring Community Healing After Gun Violence: The Power of Art.” Additional winning cities will be announced in the coming weeks.","Jackson, Mississippi, is the latest city to be awarded a $1 million Public Art Challenge Grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization of former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

New allegations surface in a lawsuit after investigation of Koch Foods in Mississippi. The company denies discriminating against black farmers.

Story Highlights Suit against Koch Foods filed in federal court in Jackson.

Koch Foods accused of fraud, breach of contract and civil rights violations.

“I have lost my home, my wife, my health, everything,” says Carlton Sanders of Forest.

Most chicken in U.S. produced on contracts with a handful of big companies.

Once or twice every year since 2005, a black farmer in Philadelphia, Mississippi, reached out to one of the country’s largest chicken companies about starting to work with it. The company, Koch Foods, said that the farmer was too far away and that it wasn’t taking on new growers, the farmer said in a sworn statement.

But an investigator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that Koch Foods had contracts with 10 farmers who were farther away and that it proceeded to recruit 165 other farmers since 2005, all of them white.

This new evidence surfaced in a lawsuit filed by another black farmer in Mississippi who ProPublica wrote about in June. Koch Foods used to have contracts with four black farmers in Mississippi but cut off business with them, one by one. The last to go, Carlton Sanders, lost his farm after Koch Foods wanted him to make expensive renovations that weren’t required of any white farmers.

(The company’s name is pronounced “cook,” and it is not related to conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch.)

Koch Foods has not yet responded to complaint in court

After ProPublica’s article, Sanders found a lawyer, personal injury attorney Elizabeth Citrin of Daphne, Alabama. The lawsuit, filed in October in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, accuses Koch Foods of fraud, breach of contract and violating the Civil Rights Act and the Packers and Stockyards Act, which regulates meat companies.

“Koch, and its employees, acted illegally and unconscionably in a manner that prevented [Carlton] Sanders from growing chickens in a fair and profitable manner, subjecting Sanders to agricultural servitude, akin to the abuses subjected to Sanders’s ancestors, who were slaves brought over from Africa against their will,” the lawsuit said. “All this conduct toward Plaintiff Sanders was due to his race.”

Koch Foods has not yet responded to the complaint in court. Its CEO, Joseph Grendys, declined to comment on the lawsuit or the other farmer who was refused a contract. “ONCE AGAIN I STATE KOCH FOODS, WHILE INVESTIGATED WAS NEVER CHARGED,” he said in an email.

In an earlier letter to ProPublica, Grendys denied discriminating against the black farmers in Mississippi. He said the company made multiple attempts to work with the farmers to keep their contracts. “If Koch had a bias against them for any reason,” Grendys wrote, “we would never have offered them contracts in the first place.”

But that is exactly what the farmer in Philadelphia said happened to him. The farmer’s name was redacted in the records obtained by ProPublica.

The farmer said Koch Foods told him he was “too far out” and it wasn’t accepting new growers. The USDA investigator calculated that his farm is a 58.8 mile drive from the feed mill, while Koch had contracts with 10 farmers who were farther away. A Koch employee also told the investigator in a 2013 interview that the company accepted growers as far away as 60 miles, according to the investigator’s notes.

The investigator also interviewed another black farmer who said he called Koch Foods about obtaining a contract and was repeatedly told that a representative would visit his farm, but no one ever came. He ended up having to sell his farm at a loss.

Contract system gives companies sweeping control over farmers

The affidavits from both farmers say they tried unsuccessfully to get contracts with other chicken companies in the area. Most chicken in the U.S. is grown on contracts with a handful of big companies. This system gives the companies sweeping control over farmers’ income and operations, while the farmers shoulder equipment costs and other risks.

African Americans lost the vast majority of their farmland during the 20th century and were excluded from government programs that benefited white farmers, contributing to the country’s racial wealth disparity. As of 2017, the latest available government data, just 1.3% of the country’s farmers were black, down slightly from 2012. On average, their farms were significantly smaller and poorer, according to USDA data.

Sanders visited Washington in July with a group organized by the Rural Advancement Foundation International to talk to lawmakers and USDA officials about strengthening enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act.

The Trump administration stopped tougher rules on chicken companies from taking effect and reduced staff in the office conducting investigations like the one into Koch Foods’ treatment of Sanders.

“I have lost my home, my wife, my health, everything,” Sanders said at a press conference during the visit, choking back tears. “When a company has as much control like these chicken companies do, then they can virtually act as they want without fear of reproach.”

Koch Foods supplies poultry to businesses like Burger King, Kroger, Walmart

Koch Foods is privately held and supplies chicken, often sold under other brand names, to restaurants and retailers such as Burger King, Kroger and Walmart.

One retailer, Foodtown, said it “made an independent decision” to stop carrying Koch Foods products. Other companies that Koch Foods’ website shows stocking its products didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Koch Foods’ facility in Morton, Mississippi, was among the sites raided by immigration authorities in August, part of the largest workplace sweep in decades. No company officials have been charged.

STARKVILLE, Miss.— Mississippi State President Mark E. Keenum congratulates the United Nations World Food Programme for receiving the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, which was announced Friday [Oct. 9] by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

In addition to MSU’s partnerships with the United Nations and the World Food Programme, Keenum’s professional background and national leadership in promoting global food security have facilitated numerous engagements with the organization. In 2016, Keenum wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating the World Food Programme for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“I would like to personally congratulate the World Food Programme and its outstanding executive director, David Beasley, on this well-earned recognition,” Keenum said. “As the Norwegian Nobel Committee noted, addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world. That is why organizations like the World Food Programme are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

Members of MSU’s leadership team met with Beasley and other United Nations leaders last November in Rome, Italy, to discuss solutions to 21st century challenges such as food insecurity and hunger. In 2014, MSU signed an agreement with the World Food Programme that focuses on cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development.

Keenum serves as chairman of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development. A three-time MSU agricultural economics graduate, he has focused a significant portion of his career on global food security. In addition to his BIFAD appointment, he is chairman of the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. He has twice spoken at the United Nations in New York about the roles public research universities play in addressing critical food and agricultural challenges. Prior to returning to his alma mater, Keenum served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Serving as MSU’s president since 2009, Keenum has helped enhance the university’s standing as a leading agricultural research university. The most recent National Science Foundation survey shows MSU is ranked No. 11 nationally with $105 million in research and development expenditures in agricultural sciences. MSU is leading the USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, in addition to other national and international collaborations aimed at helping feed a global population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050.

1,1,"Nov 23, 2020",,"Survey: Food Insecurity, Lack of Support Remain Top Challenges for Mississippians Receiving SNAP","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic. A new state survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients finds that Mississippi families need help with food, housing and utilities, especially since government assistance for many families expired earlier this year.

The survey was released by the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP). It found that 66 percent of those surveyed were having trouble buying enough food at some point during the pandemic. Child care issues were cited by 32 percent and the loss of jobs were also cited by 29 percent.

“Food security was a challenge for many Mississippians well before the pandemic, whether it was people struggling to make ends meet in low wage work or who lacked access to fresh food where they lived,” said Sara Miller, policy analyst at the Hope Policy Institute. “As the pandemic brings these issues to a crisis point, families and communities need both near-term recovery efforts and improvements to food systems in our state overall.”

Government assistance has made a real difference, with 51 percent of respondents saying programs or assistance helped. But most of that aid has expired. Organizations like the SPLC Action Fund, Hope Policy Institute, Children’s Defense Fund, Hope Delta and Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Mississippi, Mississippi Center for Justice and the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative are calling for the state and federal government to take these concerns into account and move immediately to provide more assistance.

“What this survey shows is that people need help,” said Brandon Jones, Mississippi policy director for the SPLC Action Fund. “We need the government, both at the state and federal level, to do more to help the people who are suffering because of the pandemic.”

Of the 12 Southern states surveyed, Mississippi was the only state to have SNAP and P-EBT application issues as the greatest challenges. All other Southern states had problems with unemployment insurance or stimulus checks as the top challenge. The share of Mississippi respondents who had problems applying for or receiving SNAP was 10 percentage points higher than the share for all Southern respondents (23% vs. 13%).

“The pandemic has exacerbated poverty in Mississippi and the need for holistic systems of support is urgent,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative. “Mississippians need access to food, child care, housing and employment assistance to rebuild their economic security. Mississippians who received pandemic unemployment benefits were priced out of SNAP and consequently lost food assistance, a glaring example of our fractured safety net.”

The data came from 297 anonymized surveys in Mississippi in August and September. Respondents were invited to answer a mixture of multiple choice and open-ended questions about challenges and changes in the wake of the pandemic, experiences using and applying for government benefits, and recommendations and requests for policymakers.","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic.

2,2,"Aug 7, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Hundreds arrested in ICE raids at Mississippi food processing plants,"CLOSE Gov. Phil Bryant on Monday signed into law a measure that would prevent local governments and universities enacting policies that would limit enforcement of and cooperation with federal immigration laws and enforcement.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents executed search warrants at food processing plants across Mississippi Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of 680 people.

They occurred in small towns near Jackson with a workforce made up largely of Latino immigrants, including Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastapol. About 600 agents fanned out across the plants involving several companies, surrounding the perimeters to prevent workers from fleeing.

Matthew Albence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's acting director, told The Associated Press that the raids could be the largest such operation thus far in any single state.

In an emailed statement Wednesday morning, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations special agents are executing federal search warrants today at multiple locations across the state of Mississippi as part of a coordinated operation with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi pursuant to ongoing HSI administrative and criminal investigations.”

In a second statement, Hurst said via email, ""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country.""

Bryan Cox, ICE spokesperson, said everyone taken into custody and detained Wednesday will be processed but ""not everyone is going to be (permanently) detained.""

""You are going to have persons released,"" he said. ""ICE makes custody determination on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of their circumstances.""

The names of the plants has not been publicly released by ICE officials. However, reporters were on scene at the Koch Foods Inc. processing plant in Morton. Another included the Peco Chicken Processing Plant in Canton.

In an emailed statement, Peco Foods Inc. confirmed raids took place at three of their facilities — Canton, Bay Springs and Sebastopol. The company is ""fully cooperating"" with authorities, the statement read.

This story has been corrected since originally published to indicate the warrants were being executed on Wednesday.

3,3,5 days ago,GazetteNET,Food & Farm: A ‘HIP’ way to bolster food security,"A few weeks ago, I went with my friend, Kathleen Chapman — or KC, as she’s called — to the February Winter Farmers’ Market at the Northampton Senior Center.

KC is a Southerner, a smart, funny artist and teacher who moved to Northampton from Mississippi in 2019. Shopping with her is always a good reminder of how blessed western Massachusetts is with relative abundance. Mississippi is a state that consistently ranks as the most food insecure in the nation, with a good many of its residents living miles from the nearest grocery store.

KC always remarks on the plenty of the Pioneer Valley, joking sometimes that someone needs to set up a swap between this area and the South, in which the South will ship dogs to Northampton in exchange for food.

The catch, however, is that food, along with everything else, is so much more expensive here than in Mississippi. KC, who lives in senior housing downtown, uses a combination of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — what people used to know as food stamps) and Survival Center groceries to help her stretch her fixed budget. At the Farmers’ Market, she also has access to an additional tool in the form of HIP benefits.

HIP is the Healthy Incentives Program, a state- and USDA-funded program that provides monthly incentives to SNAP households when they purchase fresh local vegetables and fruit at farmers markets, mobile markets, farm shares and farm stands. HIP automatically adds back any SNAP money spent at one of the above outlets, up to a certain amount. So, for instance, the SNAP money KC spends on local produce at the Winter Market is immediately added back to her Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, and, as a household of one, she can spend up to $40 a month on local produce via HIP.

It’s not hard to see how this might benefit the health and well-being of households with limited means. Nutrition research can be fickle and biased, but to my knowledge, there is no study that argues that increasing your daily intake of vegetables will do anything but improve your health outcomes.

And people have been using HIP. Since the program began in 2017, SNAP sales at farm retail outlets increased by a whopping 1,250%; to date, 88,000 families have used their HIP incentives, 45% of whom include seniors, and 30% of whom include children.

The program has been popular enough that the state has periodically had to halt its disbursement of HIP funding because it underestimated the demand for fresh, local produce among its low-income citizens. And besides produce, HIP can also be used to purchase edible plants, so that people who have a bit of growing room can spend their HIP allowance on veggie and herb plant starts, thus increasing their access to fresh produce for an entire season.

If these were the only benefits that accrued to the community via HIP, the program would already be an asset, but its value extends beyond the customers. HIP does a good amount of legwork in the effort to create a more sustainable food system by supporting local farmers as well.

For growers, the cost of organically raising, picking, washing, packaging and distributing produce while stewarding land in a holistic, sustainable way while paying themselves and their workers a living wage is undeniably high.

According to Olivia Pettingill of Wingate Farm, the HIP program has permitted farmers like her to cover their costs while feeding a more economically diverse range of people.

“HIP has significantly enabled a more equal distribution of high-quality produce to our local community,” she says, “and it’s done this while allowing small farmers to stay in business and even thrive.”

She points out that HIP has more lasting effects as well on the kind of general thinking and public curiosity that lead to greater food security. Local farmers try to grow produce and fruits that do well in our local climate, but that doesn’t always mean growing the vegetables that are the most conventionally recognized.

HIP incentivizes people to try different kinds of veggies that are more locally sustainable, and in doing so, it builds a marketplace that relies less on foods from far-flung places, thus reducing the carbon footprint of shipping.

SNAP Match

The program is not without its issues. As mentioned, there have been periods when it shut down for lack of funding, which is confusing and frustrating for those attempting to use their benefits. This inconsistency also limits farmers’ ability to plan, as well as HIP’s ability to make a sustained difference in people’s eating habits.

Also, if you don’t have any SNAP money left on your EBT card, you can’t access your HIP benefits, even though the two amounts are not dependent on each other. And a further issue is that the benefits are pretty specific: You can buy local vegetables and fruit, but other farm products such as eggs or meat aren’t covered.

In an effort to fill that gap, Grow Food Northampton, which operates the Tuesday Farmers’ Market and the current Winter Farmers’ Market, offers SNAP Match, a system in which Grow Food matches the amount of SNAP money an individual spends at the farmers market. (SNAP Match also doubles the match for the first $10 people spend.) In this way, farmers who sell products other than veggies aren’t left out, and people doing their shopping with SNAP benefits are given a wider selection of choices.

It’s rare, I think, to find elegant solutions where food access is concerned, and even rarer when food access, environmental stewardship and the local economy work together in any kind of synergistic fashion, which is why the combination of HIP and SNAP Match — and their potential to help further a smaller, more sustainable, and more equitable food system — is so ingenious.

The majority of SNAP Match is even funded locally, by Valley Home Improvement, which, over the last four years, has doubled the amount of assistance that Grow Food can provide to customers. Steve Silverman, Valley Home Improvement’s founder, says the company is keen on supporting local business and addressing food insecurity as well — values that are complementary and aligned in SNAP Match.

While SNAP Match will continue as long as Grow Food has the money to support it, the proposed state budget for the next fiscal year cuts HIP funding from this year’s $13 million to $5 million in 2022. Given the many benefits to both local farms and families who would otherwise lack access to sustainable fresh local produce, this seems short-sighted from every angle.

Why not keep the momentum going on a program that has demonstrated great potential to positively affect the health of the commonwealth’s most disadvantaged citizens while also allowing local farm businesses to thrive and grow food in a way increases our food security and decreases our carbon footprint?

After the events of the past year, with scary disruptions to the national supply chain due to COVID, it’s in everyone’s interest to take a closer look at the steps we can take to ensure that the bounty that KC remarked upon isn’t jeopardized — and the continued funding of HIP is one of them.

KC, by the way, came away from the Winter Market with beets and onions, eggs, a small amount of bacon for cooking with some dried lima beans, and a jug of maple syrup, which she uses to sweeten her coffee — a nice balance of items good for both body and spirit.

While on occasion the complexity of figuring out the various different systems available to help her access better quality food has been frustrating, she believes absolutely in SNAP Match and HIP as valuable resources that should be funded, and not just for her own sake.

“The vegetables are so expensive at the store that I’m hesitant to buy them,” she told me, “but here [at the Farmer’s Market], I can get these delicious fresh organic vegetables, and it’s helped me a lot. And the fact that the farmers are being supported is the biggest thrill to me.”

4,4,"May 22, 2020",Marketplace.org,“Record levels” of food insecurity in the U.S. because of COVID-19,"At some point this year, 54 million Americans — including one in four children — may not know where their next meal is coming from.

Food insecurity is rising in every part of the United States, and will continue to throughout 2020, according to new projections out this week from Feeding America.

“These are record levels,” said Emily Engelhard, managing director of research at Feeding America, which has a nationwide network of food banks. “We have not seen food insecurity reach these levels for the length of time that food insecurity has been measured.”

Some of the biggest increases are coming in states that rely heavily on tourism, like Nevada and Hawaii, which have been hit hard by pandemic-related job-losses. And the need is only continuing to grow in the states that had the highest rates of food insecurity before the pandemic, including Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana.

“Sometimes we have a tendency to feel like the issue of food insecurity is not our issue, and that it’s far away. It’s in some other neighborhood, in some other community,” Engelhard said. “But this really shows that it’s in every single community.”

More than 37 million people were already considered food insecure before COVID-19 arrived in the U.S. and devastated the economy — and that was the lowest it had been since before the Great Recession.

Since the earliest days of the pandemic, food banks across the country have been seeing a surge in demand, something they often measure in pounds. One meal is roughly 1.2 pounds, according to Catherine D’Amato, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Before the pandemic, the Greater Boston Food Bank was distributing between 4 and 5 million pounds of food a month, on average.

In March, it distributed 8 million pounds.

In April, 9.5 million pounds.

In May, it’s on track to distribute more than 10 million pounds.

“That’s a very clear indicator that something is different,” D’Amato said. “It’s historic, we’ve never seen anything like this. So there’s no roadmap for us, and we’re kind of building it.”

Projected rates of food insecurity for 2020 by state, according to Feeding America’s report, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Security. (Courtesy Feeding America)

Around 40% of the increase is coming from people who had never been to a food bank before, according to Feeding America — people who have newly lost a job, or are supporting sick family members.

With unemployment continuing to rise every week — nearly 39 million people have applied for benefits for the first time just in the last two months — food banks know that need is only going to continue to increase, and is likely to remain high for a long time.

“Are we going to be in this for five years? Are we going to be in this for three years?” D’Amato said. “We know we’re going to be in this for multiple years simply based on these historic unemployment numbers.”

So far, there has been a surge in donations, both from individuals and corporations, that is helping food banks meet the increase in demand.

But, Engelhard said, “my concern is that this will become a new normal, and that the sort of energy and community support that we’re seeing won’t sustain, even as people continue to be in dire need of support.”

COVID-19 Economy FAQs How are those COVID relief payments affecting consumers? Payments started going out within days of President Joe Biden signing the American Rescue Plan, and that’s been a big shot in the arm for consumers, said John Leer at Morning Consult, which polls Americans every day. “Consumer confidence is really on a tear. They are growing more confident at a faster rate than they have following the prior two stimulus packages.” Leer said this time around the checks are bigger and they’re getting out faster. Now, rising confidence is likely to spark more consumer spending. But Lisa Rowan at Forbes Advisor said it’s not clear how much or how fast. Will more people be working from home once the worst of the pandemic recedes? It’s still unclear whether remote work will remain widespread, but there is at least more data analyzing the costs and benefits of working from home. People might be saving on things like commuting and buying clothes, but they’re also finding that in order to make long-term remote work feasible, they’ll have to upgrade their living spaces. And that cost could outweigh savings. Chris Stanton, a Harvard business professor, said even a minor increase in working from home after the pandemic could add up to billions of dollars a year for workers. I’m hearing a lot about interest rates. Is it getting more expensive to borrow money? Expectations of higher inflation as the economy rebounds have investors demanding higher yields to compensate. In turn, the recent surge in bond yields is pushing up the interest rates consumers pay on mortgages and other loans. Economist Scott Hoyt with Moody’s Analytics said rising rates could dampen demand for housing a little and refinancing a little more. Other kinds of consumer spending are less likely to be affected. Interest on auto loans and credit cards are pegged to shorter-term rates, which haven’t been rising as much.

Since the earliest days of the pandemic, food banks across the country have been seeing a surge in demand, something they often measure in pounds."

6,6,"Nov 25, 2020",Newsweek,"Most Number of People In Need of Food This Thanksgiving Since Great Depression, Data Shows","Over 50 million Americans may be in need of food this Thanksgiving due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many states around the country are reaching Depression-era levels of hunger, according to data from nation's largest hunger-relief organization, Feeding America.

Nationally, that number equates to roughly 1 in 6 adults, and 1 in 4 children in the U.S. who are struggling to meet their basic food needs.

""The numbers are staggering,"" Eugene Cho, CEO of Bread for the World, a religious nonprofit that works to prevent food insecurity, said in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR). ""We're talking 54 million people in our backyards, in our cities, in our nation right now. That's about 1 in 6 Americans,"" he added.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted levels of food insecurity throughout the country, as millions of Americans continue to face income loss and joblessness. In June, a Northwestern University study found that food insecurity during the pandemic had doubled nationally, and tripled for households with children.

This time last year, roughly 35 million people struggled with hunger in the U.S., a number that has increased by nearly 20 million as the pandemic continues to unfold, according to Feeding America.

In a November survey conducted by the hunger relief organization, 80 percent of the 200 nationwide food banks associated with Feeding America have reported an increase in food production this year.

In total, food banks have consistently seen a 60 percent increase in demand compared to November 2019, and continue to require more food and resources to provide to people in need.

In some states, the issue reflects Depression-era levels.

In Texas, one of the hardest-hit states for COVID-19, 1 in 3 Houston households have had a serious issue affording food, and 1 in 5 do not get enough to eat every day, according to NPR.

The CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank told CNBC that his program now feeds 120,000 —or double the number of people—that they normally do. The numbers have gotten so high that they now have to ration food.

In Rhode Island, the Community Food Bank reported that one in four households struggle to put food on the table, the highest it's been since the Great Depression.

In an October report published by the University of Illinois and Feeding America, the states facing the highest levels of food insecurity include Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. In Jefferson County, Mississippi, the food insecurity rate is the highest in the country at 30.4 percent.

The issue has disproportionately effected Black, Native and Hispanic communities. According to a report from National Geographic, of the top 25 counties with the highest projected food insecurity rates, only four have a population where the majority is white.

""This is a story about racial and ethnic disparities—both food insecurity and the story of coronavirus,"" Emily Engelhard, managing director of Feeding America's research unit told National Geographic. ""The populations and geographies that started in the most disadvantageous state of food insecurity are the ones that are getting hit the hardest.""

In April, the unemployment rate during COVID-19 hit its peak at 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression, when it exceeded 25 percent.

As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country and 2020 comes to a close, Americans are pushing for Congress to pass a second round of stimulus relief to help those struggling from income loss, hunger and joblessness.

""Unless policymakers act quickly to respond to the crisis at the scale necessary, we risk the damage to the economy lasting much longer than necessary, particularly for those at the bottom who have been hit the hardest,"" a group of more than 125 economists wrote in their open letter published by the Economic Security Project on Monday.

To help support those in need this holiday season, Feeding America provides a donation service and opportunities to volunteer at local food banks across the country.","""The numbers are staggering,"" Eugene Cho, CEO of Bread for the World, a religious nonprofit that works to prevent food insecurity, said in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR).

7,7,"May 20, 2020",PRNewswire,Feeding America Study Projects Local Food Insecurity Rates Amid Pandemic Could Reach Up To 1 In 3 Adults And 1 In 2 Children,"CHICAGO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will have a devastating impact on people facing hunger across communities nationwide, according to a new study by Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization. This study is the first of its kind to explore how food insecurity rates at the local level may increase in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity analyzes food insecurity rates for the overall population and children by state, county and congressional district. According to the study, communities that had higher rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will continue to struggle more than other areas. Meanwhile, communities with lower rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will tend to see the largest relative increases in food insecurity as a result of the crisis.

Pre-pandemic – and according to the USDA's most recent report on food security in the U.S. – 37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life. However, a recent Feeding America analysis demonstrates that this number is likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children. That means approximately 54 million people (1 in 6 people) may experience food insecurity in 2020, including 18 million children (1 in 4 children).

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

According to The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, the states projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity among the overall population include Mississippi (24.1 percent), Arkansas (22.5 percent), Alabama (22.2 percent), Louisiana (21.7 percent) and New Mexico (20.7 percent). Meanwhile, the states projected to have the highest rates of child food insecurity include Louisiana (34.5 percent), New Mexico (33.9 percent), Nevada (32.9 percent), Mississippi (32.6 percent) and Alabama (32.4 percent). One in three children in these states will likely experience food insecurity this year.

Specific counties projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity this year are:

Jefferson County, MS (34.2 percent for overall population)

(34.2 percent for overall population) Issaquena County, MS (33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children)

(33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children) East Carrol Parish , LA (33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children)

(33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children) Kusilvak Census Area, AK (33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children)

(33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children) Holmes County, MS (32.7 percent for overall population)

(32.7 percent for overall population) Sabine County, TX (49.1 percent for children)

(49.1 percent for children) Zavala County, TX (48.9 percent for children)

Additionally, the counties that may see the highest change in food insecurity rates for the overall population are:

Burke County, ND (157 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(157 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Renville County, ND (131 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(131 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Dickey County, ND (127 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(127 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Loudoun County, VA (125 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(125 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Eagle County, CO (124 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

""More of our neighbors in these communities and beyond are relying in part on charitable food assistance to make ends meet,"" said Babineaux-Fontenot. ""As a result, food banks are facing a 'perfect storm' of surges in demand, declining food donations, fewer volunteers and disruptions to our operating procedures. Regardless of these challenges, we will continue to stay strong and resilient and work our best to help ensure our neighbors have food on the table.""

This new analysis was conducted by building upon the approach Feeding America used in two earlier briefs to predict changes to national food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to changes to poverty and unemployment. The annual projected unemployment rate (11.5%) is within close range of expert estimates when annualized, including those from a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of more than 60 economists as of May (11.6%), the Congressional Budget Office (11.4%), and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (10.3%). To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national unemployment projection for job loss due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

The underlying analysis for the food insecurity projections was conducted by Dr. Craig Gundersen using the model developed for Map the Meal Gap, Feeding America's county-level food insecurity report.

Other key findings from this report regarding the overall population include:

The projected rate of food insecurity is highest for Mississippi (24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018.

(24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018. North Dakota has the lowest projected rate of food insecurity for 2020 at 12.0 percent. Still, it will see the largest increase in food insecurity rates (77 percent) compared to all other states.

In addition to North Dakota , states that are projected to have the highest change in food insecurity rates – from 2018 to 2020 – include Minnesota (60 percent change), Nevada (57 percent change), Wisconsin (57 percent change) and Hawaii (57 percent change).

Other key findings from this report regarding child food insecurity:

California will see the highest increase in the number of children living in food-insecure households (852,730) bringing the total to 2.2 million. Still, Texas will be home to the most children facing food insecurity (2.3 million).

8,8,"May 4, 2018",Mississippi Today,Mississippi still the hungriest state,"For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

“We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.

10,10,"Feb 10, 2020",Center For American Progress,Trump’s Newest Budget Would Take Food Away From Working Families,"There are dozens of programs on the chopping block in the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal. Yet the administration’s most blatant attempt to gut the programs on which American families depend comes in the form of additional cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s largest nutrition assistance program. The proposed budget contains a devastating $182 billion cut to SNAP over the next decade, a reduction of approximately 28 percent compared with the baseline level estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.

SNAP is a vital support that was used by 34 million Americans in an average month in 2019, and the entire program still costs less than President Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the richest 1 percent of American households. Targeting SNAP for cuts therefore makes a negligible difference for the overall budget but does considerable harm to families. These cuts clearly demonstrate who the Trump administration prioritizes.

New research shows that despite low unemployment and other surface-level indicators of a strong economy, nearly 51 million American households—43 percent of all households—are unable to afford basic necessities such as food, transportation, and health care. There are 16.1 million American households officially in poverty, in addition to 34.7 million households who aren’t officially under the poverty line but whose low-paying jobs and high rents and health care costs mean that they must often go without basic necessities.

In a recent poll of registered voters conducted by the Center for American Progress, a staggering one-third of respondents said that, at some point over the past year, they or an immediate family member had too little money to buy food. Food insecurity is particularly prevalent for older adults; Black, Latinx, and American Indian families; and people in rural areas. For families like these, SNAP is a necessary—although often insufficient—protection against hunger.

As shown in the figures above, counties where residents use SNAP the most tend to have had the slowest economic growth and most tenuous labor market conditions. These counties took much longer to recover from the Great Recession and continue to face unemployment rates that are higher than those of the rest of the nation. At the height of the recession, these counties had an unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent, which has had long-ranging consequences for the areas’ economic stability—even a decade later.

While the Trump administration often touts a booming economy, low overall unemployment belies the differences between local conditions across the country. For example, cities such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, have unemployment rates that are twice as high as the national rate. Historically, states have been able to relax some paperwork requirements for SNAP recipients to prove that they are working in areas with high unemployment rates. However, in December 2019, the Trump administration limited states’ ability to account for local availability of jobs by changing the rule governing the long-standing waiver system. It is now more difficult for struggling areas to give residents longer to find a job when jobs are scarce; in the event of a future economic downturn, this rule change will make it harder for everyone to recover.

Policies that require people to prove that they’re working before they can receive benefits rely on debunked stereotypes about fraud and human behavior. Behavioral economic and psychological research has repeatedly shown that scarcity makes it harder for people to plan for anything other than the most immediate emergency. Children who don’t have enough food have worse health and learning outcomes. Adults’ decision-making is influenced by even the perception or fear of scarcity. Moreover, job-seekers are more successful in their searches when they have reliable access to food, shelter, and other basic necessities. Taking SNAP away from families when they lose a job simply punishes those who are already struggling to make ends meet, pushing them deeper into poverty and disrupting their efforts toward financial security.

President Trump’s proposed cuts to SNAP should come as no surprise. His administration has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to restricting families’ access to food. Last year’s budget proposed cuts to SNAP, and the administration spent the next year finding new ways to make those cuts a reality. Each year’s budget under this administration has compounded the cuts of past years, placing the burden on families struggling to make ends meet.

A pair of identical bills in both the Senate and the House of the 2020 Legislature sought to push the seiners at least half a mile off Cat Island, the last remaining island they could still fish.

“If they take Cat Island, all that’s left is one other little inside place where there are so many recreational fishermen and all that it gets run over eight or 10 times a day — there’s nothin’ there. And that’s what they’re wantin’ to leave us with,” said haul seiner Martin Young.

The state’s other four barrier islands have been off-limits to commercial fishermen since the 1990s, when managers of the federal Gulf Islands National Seashore pushed them at least one mile away; Cat Island is shared between federal, state and private owners.

Rep. Timmy Ladner

“The legislation would make it harder for the average Mississippi consumer to obtain fresh, local sustainable seafood,"" said Ryan Bradley, executive director of the Mississippi Commercial Fishermen United. ""It would be a real food security problem for a state that has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire nation.”

The Coastal Conservation Association’s House Bill 561, sponsored by Rep. Timmy Ladner, passed 118-3 on March 11. The sportsmen’s Senate Bill 2720, sponsored by Sens. Mike Thompson, Scott DeLano and Phillip Moran, passed 50-2 on March 10. The bills had moved to the opposite chambers, but the Legislature shut down before they could be voted on.

Sen. Mike Thompson

Mississippi’s Commission on Marine Resources, the specialized panel charged with managing the state’s coastal resources, opposed the bills in an April 7 resolution to the Legislature: “The two legislative bills will unfairly and inequitably restrict the rights and equal access of the commercial fishing industry to the marine resources of the state of Mississippi,” wrote the five-member panel.

The CCA narrowly missed its target in 2018 when the commission was unable to break a tie vote.

“Why have a commission if (the legislators are) gonna overrule what they’re doing?"" asked Young.

Seiners won’t learn whether returning legislators would be sobered by the CMR’s statement — or the recently heightened emphasis on food security — until after the legislature reconvenes on May 7.","And that’s what they’re wantin’ to leave us with,” said haul seiner Martin Young.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is highlighting its partnership with Mississippi State University to develop and enhance animal and veterinary public health, plant and fish health, food safety and nutrition programs.

A new FAO publication titled “Strengthening food security through innovative aquaculture management,” is online at http://www.fao.org/3/ca9300en/CA9300EN.pdf as part of the organization’s academia partnerships webpage.

The FAO brief states, “Joining hands in partnership since 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Mississippi State University (MSU) are collaborating to exchange resources, expertise, experience and knowledge to improve food and nutrition security and alleviate poverty through sustainable aquaculture development efforts.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has led the university for more than a decade, has made food security a central focus of his professional life. Keenum has long advocated the impact major research universities in the United States, particularly land-grant universities like MSU, can have in the global fight against hunger and poverty. Currently, Keenum serves as chairman of both the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the Board of International Food and Agricultural Development.

After establishing its partnership with MSU in 2010, the FAO recognized the university in 2014 as a Center of Knowledge and a member of the Global Aquaculture Advancement Partnership. In 2018, MSU was selected to be a Candidate FAO Reference Center on Aquaculture Biosecurity and Antimicrobial Resistance.

The brief states that key results of the FAO-MSU partnership include combatting aquatic antimicrobial resistance, advancing innovations for food security, improving aquaculture biosecurity, and forming the next generation of food security leaders.

MSU also is home of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and part of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for global populations dependent on aquaculture- and fisheries-led economies. MSU leads the lab through its Global Center for Aquatic Food Security, directed by Mark Lawrence, a professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Lawrence will give a keynote presentation during the FAO’s upcoming webinar in July on innovative biosecurity approaches for a healthier aquaculture industry.

13,13,"Dec 21, 2020",The Counter,Hunger and food insecurity are not the same. Here’s why that matters—and what they mean.,"For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

But that number actually represented the lowest rates of food insecurity in nearly a decade. The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic.

A snapshot assessment led by the U.S. Census Bureau and designed to offer less-comprehensive but more immediate information on the social and economic impacts of Covid, showed that, as recently as the period between November 25 and December 7 (including Thanksgiving), some 27 million adults—13 percent of all adults in the country—reported their household sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat.","For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.
In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak.
The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic."

STARKVILLE, Miss.—The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish at Mississippi State University is awarding $5.7 million in grants to develop innovative approaches for helping solve hunger affecting more than 800 million people worldwide.

As part of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future program and funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Fish Innovation Lab works to reduce poverty and improve nutrition, food security and livelihoods in developing countries by supporting research on sustainable aquaculture and fisheries systems.

“Rich in protein and nutrients, fish are among the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Improving how fish are produced, caught, prepared, distributed and sold can enhance nutrition and livelihoods among small-scale producers and low-income households in many developing countries,” said Mark Lawrence, director of the Fish Innovation Lab and professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

Through the $5.7 million, the Fish Innovation Lab is supporting 12 research-for-development projects focused on aquaculture and fisheries activities along the fish value chain in Bangladesh (3), Cambodia (2), Kenya (1), Nigeria (5) and Zambia (1).

Addressing challenges unique to each location, project teams will be working to increase fish production, mitigate risk of disease and fish loss, and improve human outcomes in targeted regions of the developing countries with high need. All projects also will incorporate the Fish Innovation Lab’s cross-cutting themes—human capacity development, gender equity and youth inclusion, nutrition and resilience. The projects were selected through a competitive process that garnered 247 proposals. Each project is led by a U.S. and a host country principal investigator and supported by a team of researchers at U.S. and host country institutions, fostering shared learning and collaborative strategies throughout the lab.

“The Fish Innovation Lab is a platform for innovation, connecting a consortium of public and private organizations, government agencies, universities and aquaculture associations to address promising advances and emerging challenges in aquaculture and fisheries,” Lawrence said.

Mississippi State is the lead research institution for two of the projects in addition to overseeing and supporting the full research portfolio as the management entity of the Fish Innovation Lab.

Mississippi State is a top-ranking university for agriculture and natural resources research and development, generating more than $100 million in expenditures annually. The university is recognized as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. MSU’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security addresses challenges facing aquaculture and finds solutions to meeting the world’s food security needs while ensuring a safe supply of fish.

MSU President Mark E. Keenum is a former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has made food security a central focus of his professional life. Currently, he serves as chairman of both the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the Board of International Food and Agricultural Development.

WASHINGTON (CN) — Experts called it critical Monday that a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from leaving nearly 700,000 people without food stamps at a time of rising food insecurity with millions of Americans out of work during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ruling against the Department of Agriculture at summary judgment Sunday, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found that the rule it adopted late last year “radically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice” for administering food stamps through SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Howell slammed the agency as “icily silent” on how its proposal would affect more than 1 million people who receive SNAP benefits during a pandemic that so far has killed nearly 220,00 Americans and quadrupled the national unemployment rate.

Food insecurity is on the rise, meanwhile, and still climbing.

“The main frontline of defense that we have is SNAP,” Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center, told Courthouse News on Monday.

After the Great Recession, it took 10 years for the food-insecurity rate to get back to levels seen before the 2008 economic crash, she added.

“We don’t know exactly what this recovery will look like. But we know from prior experience that it takes a long time for people to dig out,” Waxman said.

Julia Henly, who chairs the doctoral program for the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, agreed that SNAP is proven to reduce food insecurity and is a critical economic support to low-income families.

“This is a time to simplify SNAP access, not make the eligibility process more difficult,” Henly said in an email Monday.

States historically have had the power to waive the work mandates that food-stamp beneficiaries face. Without court intervention, the Trump administration would have made such waivers harder to implement. In a thriving economy, noted Henly, such a move makes little sense.

“But it would be especially poor public policy to reinstate work mandates at a time when over 12 million Americans are unemployed and community food banks are stretched to the limit. This is precisely the time when SNAP benefits are most critical, without making their access conditional on work,” she said.

Economist Robert Hartley likewise called the rule a “strange juxtaposition” to the efforts of Congress, which through the CARES Act has suspended time limits on work requirements for so-called “able-bodied adults without dependents” who are eligible for relief under SNAP.

An estimated 700,000 such adults could have found themselves kicked off food stamps this year if the Trump administration’s rule had held up in court.

SNAP is “perhaps the most accessible and successful support” for American families facing economic hardship, a safety net made all the more valuable during the pandemic, Hartley said in an email.

“Restricting access as proposed would offer small savings in relative terms to government spending, but the personal hardship that would result is significant, especially since individuals’ constraints and health challenges may be difficult to observe as we label who is able-bodied,” said Hartley, who is an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University.

Judge Howell, an Obama appointee, had temporarily blocked the rule set to impose new eligibility requirements from taking effect on April 1, calling SNAP essential. In her 67-page ruling Sunday, Howell wrote that USDA had failed to explain how the changes followed the federal rulemaking process or “make sense.”

Just over the last six months, Howell added, “SNAP rosters have grown by over 17 percent with over 6 million new enrollees.”

While the rule change attempted by the Trump administration had targeted adults without dependents, Waxman noted that many food stamp recipients are noncustodial parents. Even if their children live with another parent, such individuals can still bear financial or caretaking responsibilities.

Waxman called SNAP a critical stimulus program that should not be pared back amid a deadly outbreak whose economic toll remains untold, pointing to research that shows every dollar spent in the program returns anywhere from $1.50 to $1.80 back to the recipient’s community.

“This is a program that helps fuel recoveries,” Waxman said. “It’s just a relief that this is one fewer battle that’ll have to be fought right now.”

The lawsuit was brought in January by attorneys general from 19 states as well as the District of Columbia and New York City.

“At a time of national crisis, this decision is a win for common sense and basic human decency,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a press release Monday. “This Trump administration rule was cruel to its core and ran counter to who we are and what we represent as a nation.”

Hartley noted Monday that New York was the first state to pilot a SNAP Online Purchasing program in 2019 that has rapidly expanded to 47 states since May.

Without SNAP, he added, the country would see “large increases in food insecurity, especially unprecedented spikes in child food insecurity, or else extreme lines at food banks or other distribution centers.”

D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine over Twitter Monday called the proposed rule change “heartless and unlawful,” saying it put the lives of the 700,000 Americans who may have lost SNAP benefits at risk.","(AP Photo/Rogelio V.

18,18,"Oct 11, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,MSU maintains partnership with Nobel Peace Prize winner,"The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

The World Food Program, a United Nations agency, works to provide food for undernourished populations, particularly in countries at war. The MSU Office of Public Affairs issued a congratulatory statement from university president Mark Keenum in a Saturday press release.

“Addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world,” Keenum said. “That is why organizations like the World Food Program are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could bring the number of people facing “acute food insecurity” up to 265 million worldwide, according to an April press release from WFP.

MSU and WFP have worked together since 2010 “on issues related to food safety and nutrition,” MSU Chief Communications Officer Sid Salter said. The two entities signed an agreement in 2014 to focus on “cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development,” according to the press release.

Keenum and two other MSU leaders — Provost David Shaw and Interim Vice President for Research Julie Jordan — with U.N. leaders in Rome in November 2019 to discuss solutions to global food insecurity.

MSU invests $105 million, the eleventh-most nationwide, in agricultural sciences research and development, according to the National Science Foundation.

MSU also is the headquarters and leading institution in the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, an aquaculture research organization funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The lab focuses on building sustainable fish farming systems in countries around the world to alleviate food insecurity.

Keenum is the chairman of both the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. Before becoming MSU’s president in 2009, Keenum was a USDA undersecretary in charge of overseeing international initiatives to combat world hunger.

He wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in January 2016 nominating WFP for that year’s Nobel Peace Prize. In the letter, which Salter provided to The Dispatch, Keenum pointed out WFP’s work to provide “millions of healthy school meals and supplementary nutrition” to children suffering from nutrient deficiencies “in the most destitute parts of the world.”

“All of us, and particularly the developed countries, have a moral obligation to address the persistent human tragedy of hunger and its associated ills,” Keenum wrote. “We must also recognize that lasting peace among and within nations is likely impossible while large populations remain at risk of starvation.”

WFP provided nutritional assistance to nearly 100 million people in 88 countries in 2019, with some of its largest efforts focused on Yemen and South Sudan. Founded in 1961, the organization has helped populations affected by a range of humanitarian crises, including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and wars in the Balkan region of Eastern Europe in the 1990s.","The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

The hardest-hit groups are Black and Latino households, as well as low-income individuals.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Food insecurity is nothing new in the US, but the coronavirus pandemic has exasperated the problem.

Mass layoffs and furloughs have led to more Americans unsure about how they will put food on the table in the coming months.

A pre-pandemic study by the USDA shows ""37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life.""

Based of data from that study, Feeding America estimates the number is "" likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children.""

These disparities are drawn between strong racial and economic divides.

In the US, Latino residents are two times more likely to suffer from food inequality than their white counterparts; Black residents are two-and-a-half times more likely.

This goes hand-in-hand with food deserts, which are more common in areas with a large Latino or Black population.

""It's not new, even though with COVID-19 we've seen an increase in food insecurity overall, and it seems like people of color again are disproportionately impacted,"" Angela Odoms-Young, associate professor in the department of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Bloomberg.

""Eight of the 10 counties with the highest food-insecurity rates are more than 60% Black,"" according to the Feeding America report.

Jefferson County, Mississippi, and Issaquena County, Mississippi will experience the highest rates of food insecurity this year, at 34.2% and 33.9%, respectively. This comes after Issaquena County didn't report a single case of coronavirus until after May 1.

Mississippi also has some of the lowest unemployment benefits in the US, at an average of $213 a week.

There is also no sign of relief coming soon. The federal unemployment benefit of $600 a week lapsed at the end of July, and Congress has not yet signed a deal for a new stimulus package.","54 million people in the US will face food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America.

March 27, 2020 update: The U.S. House of Representative overwhelmingly passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus recovery and stimulus bill today, sending it to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it.

March 26, 2020 update: The Senate’s stimulus bill includes nearly $16 billion for SNAP, but not the additional 15 percent boost that Democrats were seeking. Also included in the bill is a $9.5 billion emergency fund for producers of specialty crops and support for local food systems, including farmers’ markets. In addition, the bill directs $285 million to USDA agencies to support emergency operations during the pandemic.

March 25, 2020 update: The Senate and White House early on Wednesday reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion spending bill aimed at supporting businesses, workers, and individuals during the pandemic. The bill text is not yet public, but once it is made public, the House of Representatives will review and vote on the bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats earlier this week offered their own version of a stimulus / support package.

March 18, 2020 update: The Senate on Wednesday afternoon voted 90-8 to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, aimed at providing some support and benefits to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

March 16, 2020 update: Early on Saturday, March 14, the House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with strong bipartisan support, and with many of the provisions described in the original article below included.

The final text includes language that gives USDA the ability to waive various requirements that are preventing districts from feeding hungry children while schools are shuttered. As of March 15, at least 64,000 schools have closed, affecting more than 32.5 million students.

On SNAP, the final bill prevents eligibility restrictions during a public health emergency and gives states some flexibility to ask for emergency allotments, but does not directly increase benefits. It also provides an additional $500 million in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and an additional $250 million for food programs for low-income seniors, through September 2021.

The Senate is expected to take up the bill today. While some Republicans and President Trump have signaled support, its fate is still uncertain.

March 13, 2020, 3pm ET update:In a press conference at 2:00pm ET, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be “passing a bill” today. “Our bill takes aggressive action to strengthen food security initiatives including student meals as well as SNAP, senior meals, and food banks,” she said. However, Civil Eats has yet to see a final version of the legislative package, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. So it remains unclear which of the provisions on school meals and SNAP benefits (described below, as provisions of separate marker bills) will make it into the final legislation.

March 13, 2020, 11am ET update: As of early Friday, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate the package of legislation; a vote in the House of Representatives is expected today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned for the weekend on Thursday, but canceled the Senate’s scheduled recess next week, so a vote on the legislative package could happen next week if the House passes the bill.

At least 10,600 schools have closed across the U.S., affecting at least 4.9 million students. Five states have closed their schools entirely: Ohio, Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and Washington.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—As aquaculture and fisheries play an increasingly important role in addressing global food security, Mississippi State University is continuing to build its reputation as an international leader in the field.

In addition to leading the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, MSU is playing a key role in developing a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) program to improve aquaculture biosecurity in developing countries. Closer to home, MSU is conducting aquaculture research and extension in support of Mississippi producers. Researchers also are rehabilitating and studying sea turtles and dolphins in the Mississippi Sound to gain insight into the ecosystem’s overall health.

“As the world population continues to grow, aquaculture and fisheries represent an important part of the effort to put food on everybody’s table,” MSU President Mark E. Keenum said. “Like every area of food production, aquaculture has many challenges that producers must navigate, but I am proud of the role MSU is playing at the state, national and international levels to develop solutions that will help achieve global food security.

“Our partnerships with institutions like USAID and FAO are a testament to the outstanding capabilities and leadership of our researchers in this field. I am confident these efforts will generate even more opportunities for MSU to grow its role as a leader in international aquaculture development.”

MSU’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security was founded to leverage the university’s aquatic food security expertise, developed in support of Mississippi aquaculture production, to pursue international development in the area. The center is led by Dr. Mark Lawrence, a professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and director of the Fish Innovation Lab.

Since MSU was selected to lead the Fish Innovation Lab in late 2018, the university has worked with its partners to develop the national and international networks needed to carry out the work, as well as solicit proposals for and fund projects in several developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited international travel, but Lawrence said key partners continue to connect with each other virtually.

MSU has a longstanding relationship with FAO that includes several projects focused on aquaculture health and biosecurity. For the last two years, MSU has been working with FAO to develop a progressive management pathway for aquaculture biosecurity in developing countries. The program creates a four-level development plan for countries to keep their fish supply safe from animal diseases and develop emergency response plans. MSU is recognized as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health by the FAO. The university is in the process of becoming an official FAO Reference Center for Aquaculture Biosecurity, further positioning MSU to assist in global fish health efforts.

Lawrence said fish can play an important role in preventing “hidden hunger” or nutritional stunting, which occurs when people receive sufficient calories, but insufficient nutrients and vitamins because of an imbalanced diet.

“If we can make more fish available in developing countries, it can go a long way in reducing nutritional deficiencies,” Lawrence said. “Reducing childhood nutritional stunting is a major goal of the United Nations and other international agencies, and fish can play a really important role in helping alleviate that problem.”

23,23,"May 8, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Mississippi identified as most food insecure state in U.S. - The Vicksburg Post,"By Mississippi Today

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.
The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates.

24,24,"Jun 3, 2020",PRNewswire,Study Shows State And Local Food Insecurity Reached Lowest Levels Since Its Inception 10 Years Ago,"CHICAGO, June 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- After nearly ten years, food insecurity levels for most communities across the country had reached their lowest levels in 2018, according to a study released by Feeding America. Map the Meal Gap, released today by Feeding America, is the only study that provides local-level estimates of food insecurity across the United States. Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization, has released the report for ten consecutive years to offer insights on how food insecurity and food costs vary at the local level.

In conjunction with the Map the Meal Gap study, which uses the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Census Bureau, Feeding America has released an interactive map based on its recently released study, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, which used the Map the Meal Gap model to predict changes to food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to projected changes to poverty and unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus (COVD-19) pandemic. That analysis shows that progress made to food insecurity in the U.S. this past decade will likely be wiped out and food insecurity rates will climb higher than the peak of the Great Recession of 50 million people, potentially going from more than 37 million people facing hunger in 2018 up to more than 54 million in 2020.

""Map the Meal Gap shows once again that not one single county in this country is free from hunger,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, chief executive officer of Feeding America. ""In the decade before the pandemic, we made progress in finally returning to pre-Great Recession levels of food insecurity, though that number was still regrettably high. That fragile progress has given way under the weight of this crisis. The Feeding America network of food banks knows all too well the precarious nature of household budgets. We also know that the work that we do has great potential to help and we cannot make meaningful progress alone. Our vision is an America where no one is hungry. Join us in making that mission a reality for the tens of millions of people out there who need us now more than ever.""

Per Map the Meal Gap 2020, all 3,142 counties and county equivalents as well as 436 congressional districts in all 50 states are home to people who struggle with hunger. The percentage of the population estimated to be food insecure in 2018 ranges from a low of 3.6% of the population in Burke County, North Dakota up to 30.4% in Jefferson County, Mississippi. Child food insecurity rates range from 2.4% in Falls Church City, Virginia to 43.7% in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana.

According to the COVID-19 impact analysis, the food insecurity rates for all counties across the country will likely see increases. For example, Jefferson County, Mississippi, the county with the highest overall food insecurity rate is projected to increase from 30.4% to 34.2% this year. Burke County, North Dakota, which had the lowest overall food insecurity rate in 2018, is projected to see a food insecurity rate (9.2%) more than 2.5 times its most recent rate (3.6%). In East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, more than half the child population is projected to be food insecure, with the rate going from 43.7% to 52.5% because of the pandemic.

While food insecurity affects every community, people of color and African Americans, in particular, are disproportionately impacted as a result of structural disparities. In 2018, food insecurity among African American households was more than twice that of white, non-Hispanic households according to the USDA. Structural and institutional racism have positioned communities of color as particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout and health consequences of this pandemic. Systemic barriers to jobs less likely to be affected by the pandemic, lower than average wages, and greater employment instability all contribute to African American workers being more at risk of experiencing food insecurity. Both pre-pandemic and in 2020, counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are overrepresented by counties with a majority African American population. For example, in Jefferson County, Mississippi, which has the highest food insecurity rate in 2018 and highest projected rate in 2020, 86% of the population is African American.

These Feeding America studies underscore the extent of need that remains in communities across the United States. Food insecurity is a measure defined by the USDA as lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members.

Other key findings of Map the Meal Gap 2020 include:

One-third of people who are food insecure may not qualify for federal food assistance. Virtually every county (97%) is home to people who are food insecure and likely ineligible for such assistance, and there are 115 counties in which a majority of people estimated to be food insecure is unlikely to qualify.

Counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are disproportionately rural. Rural counties – those outside of major metropolitan areas – make up 63% of all U.S counties, but 87% of counties with food insecurity rates in the top 10%.

An estimated 84% of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity – those that rank in the top 10% of all 3,142 counties – are in the South. Since the South contains 45% of all U.S. counties, this region is home to a disproportionately high number of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity.

""Hunger in America must become unacceptable for all of us,"" Babineaux-Fontenot continued. ""There were 37 million people facing hunger before the pandemic, but most people had no idea. If there is any 'silver lining' to the dark cloud of this pandemic, it is that the American public is far better informed about the food crisis that has accompanied the health one. We know it will take an entire network of support, including food banks, partner agencies like food pantries, federal nutrition programs, the food industry, and the public to make the progress that is so desperately needed.""

Map the Meal Gap 2020 uses data from USDA, the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and food price data and analysis provided by Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company. The study is supported by Conagra Brands Foundation and Nielsen.

""Conagra Brands Foundation is proud to partner with Feeding America and food banks across the country to help provide food to children, teenagers, adults and senior citizens. Helping to increase awareness of this critical issue, which affects every community in America, has never been more important,"" said Robert J. Rizzo, Senior Director, Community Investment, Conagra Brands and Conagra Brands Foundation.

In addition to food-insecurity estimates, Map the Meal Gap reports on food price variation across counties. Using data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS), the study finds that, on average, food-secure individuals report spending $3.09 per person, per meal as of 2018. This is essentially the same as the national average of $3.02 ($3.09 in 2018 dollars) as reported in Map the Meal Gap last year.

After adjusting the national average meal cost of $3.09 based on local sales taxes and Nielsen data on relative food prices, Map the Meal Gap 2020 finds that county meal costs range from 69% of the national average in places like Llano County, Texas ($2.14) to more than double the average cost in places like New York County, New York ($6.19).

""Nielsen is proud to continue our decade long data and analytics partnership to Map the Meal Gap. Eliminating hunger is especially urgent with so many vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said David Rawlinson, CEO, Nielsen Global Connect.

Dr. Craig Gundersen, Professor of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois, Executive Director of the National Soybean Research Laboratory and a member of Feeding America's Technical Advisory Group is the lead researcher of Map the Meal Gap 2020 and the food insecurity projection analysis.

Map the Meal Gap 2020 provides the following data online through an interactive map:

The estimated percentage of the population and number of individuals who are food insecure in every U.S. state, county and congressional district, as well as the service area of each Feeding America food bank.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely qualifies for SNAP and other federal nutrition programs.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely does not qualify for federal nutrition programs and thus must rely even more on charitable food assistance. These percentages reflect individuals in households with earnings that are higher than the state gross income limits for federal nutrition programs.

The average meal cost in every state and county.

The food budget shortfall in every state and county.

The Map the Meal Gap 2020 map allows policymakers, state agencies, corporate partners, food banks and advocates to develop integrated strategies to fight hunger on a community level.

Separately, a new interactive map shows the 2020 food insecurity projections compared to the most recent Map the Meal Gap data. To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national annual unemployment projection due to COVID-19 using projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation from Goldman Sachs Investment Research and actual percentages of workers by industry from the American Community Survey.

Along with the interactive map and visualizations, Feeding America has also published a series of report briefs, including a summary of key findings as well as analyses on child food insecurity, food price variation and health, disability and food insecurity.

Federal nutrition assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), serve as the first line of defense against hunger. However, not everyone who is food insecure qualifies for these federal programs. As of 2018, one in three (32%) food-insecure individuals who reported income lived in households unlikely to qualify for most federal food assistance. These findings underscore the importance of protecting and strengthening the existing safety net of public food assistance while also investing in the charitable programs that help to fill the gap for people who are not eligible.

Keenum sign memorandums of understanding to create three new programs with FAO offering international internship, fellowship and volunteer opportunities for MSU students, recent graduates and faculty. Keenum and other senior MSU administrators attended meetings at the FAO headquarters in Rome on Wednesday [Nov. 6], and Keenum delivered a speech about the university’s work to address key challenges of the 21st century. (Photo submitted)

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State University’s work to address key challenges of the 21st century was the focus of a speech delivered by MSU President Mark E. Keenum in Italy today [Nov. 6].

At the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome, Keenum addressed an audience of FAO officials and staff, as well as ambassadors to the UN’s mission in the historic capital city.

“We know that agriculture is a key to transforming developing nations and reducing poverty,” he said. “We also know that for the United States, investing in international agriculture aid pays dividends domestically.”

According to the FAO, more than 820 million people suffer from chronic hunger and about 736 million people live in extreme poverty. The agency is working with its partners to “achieve a world without hunger, malnutrition and poverty and do so in a sustainable manner.”

Keenum described the impact major research universities in the United States, like MSU, can have in the global fight against hunger and poverty.

“American universities, and particularly land-grant institutions such as Mississippi State University, are well equipped to help governments, international organizations like FAO, the private business sector, and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in addressing these pervasive problems,” he said. “Land-grant universities have knowledge, infrastructure and experience pertinent to every aspect of the food chain, from the laboratory to the farm to the market to the table. Our challenge is to bring our resources to bear on critical global issues.”

A former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Keenum has made food security a central focus of his professional life. Currently, he serves as chairman of both the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the Board of International Food and Agricultural Development.

Mississippi State is ranked in the top 10 nationally for agriculture and natural resources research and development, generating more than $100 million in expenditures annually. The university is actively engaged in support of Mississippi agriculture, which has a nearly $8 billion annual farm-gate value and employs more than a quarter of the workforce in the state.

In addition to the speech, Keenum signed agreements to expand Mississippi State’s partnership with the FAO. The memorandums of understanding will create three new programs offering international internship, fellowship and volunteer opportunities for MSU students, recent graduates and faculty.

“Rome continues to be a priority for us as our global engagement efforts grow in depth and scope academically and in research,” said MSU Provost and Executive Vice President David Shaw. “These new agreements will benefit our students and faculty, and also contribute to FAO’s overall mission.”

Shaw and Interim Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan joined Keenum for meetings in Rome with the FAO and several additional MSU partners in the city, including the University of Rome Tor Vergata and the University of Arkansas Rome Center.

Jordan also continues to serve as associate vice president for international programs and director of the MSU International Institute.

“The study abroad opportunities for our students and faculty exchanges we have in place in Rome will benefit from the additional agreements with the FAO,” Jordan said. “International engagement is based on having successful partnerships, and we are fortunate to have great partners in Rome and a thriving collaborative culture at MSU.”

MSU has a long-standing relationship with the FAO, with research partnerships focused on food safety, nutrition, aquatic animal health and agriculture, among other areas. The FAO and the World Food Programme have recognized MSU as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health.

Mississippi State offers a study abroad program for students at Arkansas’ Rome Center. Housed in a 500-year-old building in the ancient yet modern city, the program offers courses in architecture, art, interior design, humanities, fashion design, historic preservation and business.

MSU has hosted more than a dozen students from Tor Vergata over the past few years. In the summer of 2020, students and faculty from MSU’s Bagley College of Engineering will be visiting the public research university.

In the wake of immigration raids that resulted in nearly 700 people being arrested, Mississippi held a job fair to hire more workers for food processors on Monday.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

In Mississippi, one of the food processing companies that was raided last week by immigration officials is now looking for workers. Nearly 700 people were arrested in those raids. Some of them worked at plants operated by Koch Foods. Today, Koch held a job fair in the town of Forest, Miss. NPR's Debbie Elliott was there and sends this report.

DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Early morning, it seemed as if members of the media outnumbered job applicants at the WIN Job Center.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, no media.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: No media.

ELLIOTT: No media.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah.

ELLIOTT: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: What is that?

ELLIOTT: A security guard turned reporters away as a steady stream of people went inside to put in an application. Amanda Steele of Morton got here early before the doors opened.

AMANDA STEELE: Well, I'm, you know, finding a job, and I heard they might be doing some hiring. And me and my daughter come here Friday, and we did an application. And we seen the sign that said they were going to have the job fair. And then we come on out this morning. We got up at 6 o'clock this morning ready to go. Hopefully, we walk out of here with some good news, with a job.

ELLIOTT: Steele and other applicants say they had to provide two forms of identification, including a Social Security card. She has mixed feelings about the ICE raids that separated some families.

STEELE: Yeah, you know, I feel bad for the little kids, too. You know, their mom and dad's out of a job, you know, but I've been out of a job too, you know?

ELLIOTT: A little over a hundred people had put in applications by mid-morning according to Mississippi Department of Employment Security spokeswoman Dianne Bell.

DIANNE BELL: This is actually business as usual for us. We do not have a multitude of people coming in.

ELLIOTT: The WIN Job Center is a centralized job search location, and Bell says it's typical for the agency to host job fairs and collect applications for companies. Bell says Koch Foods asked for this job fair last Wednesday, the day of the raids. She does not know how many workers Koch needs, and no one from the company was at the job fair site.

Koch's chicken processing plant in Morton, Miss., employs more than a thousand people at peak production. In a statement, Koch said it does not yet know how many workers were arrested and said the raid resulted in a significant disruption of work. Morton Mayor Gerald Keeton hopes Koch can find the workers it needs to stay in business.

GERALD KEETON: Koch Food is the largest employer in our city, and they're attributed to approximately 45% of our total revenue in our city. So, you know, that's - if they are not here, we're in trouble.

ELLIOTT: Twenty-two-year-old Kamerio Whitley came from Lake, Miss., to apply. He says he used to work at the plant.

KAMERIO WHITLEY: I want to do my old job - hanging birds, rehanging cold birds.

ELLIOTT: Whitley says there's a misconception that only people here illegally want the poultry jobs.

WHITLEY: They won't complain about the job as much as everybody else, but I believe that all of the jobs in these chicken plants are fairly easy.

ELLIOTT: He sees the ICE raids as an opportunity. So does Rodney Reid of Forest.

RODNEY REID: Well, I'm currently employed right now at a lumber mill, but it just don't cut it. It just don't pay, and these chicken plants pay twice what I'm getting paid now, so I'm trying to shoot for better.

ELLIOTT: Workers there can make upwards of $10 an hour.

REID: A lot of these people right from right here need these jobs, you know? If they were over here illegally - I mean, it's rough out here. They come over here and tell me, it's hard to beat them out. They're going to work cheaper, you know what I'm saying? It used to be you come down here and put these applications in, you was wasting your time.

ELLIOTT: Reid says he actually feels confident about getting a job this time.

OXFORD, Miss. – Attending an international summit on world food security proved an unforgettable experience for a University of Mississippi junior who was among an elite group selected to attend the event.

“As I stepped foot in the plenary hall on the first day of the conference, I felt myself being surrounded by the world,” said Rohan Agrawal, a Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College student who attended the Committee on World Food Security at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations headquarters in Rome.

Agrawal was one of only four U.S. college students awarded a Planet Forward scholarship to the meeting, where he met with foreign diplomats, including the leader of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s agricultural development team.

“The opportunity to meet with so many global leaders and discuss the role of technology in important issues like poverty, hunger, education and climate change is something I will always treasure,” he said.

Agrawal became interested in using technology to revolutionize agriculture, conserve resources and increase yields before leaving his home in Central India to attend Ole Miss. The computer science major, who is pursuing minors in international relations and mathematics, spoke before the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year as part of an Honors College-sponsored trip to New York.

During the meeting, Agrawal had an opportunity to interact with keynote speaker María Juliana Ruiz Sandoval, the first lady of Colombia, and interview her about Colombia’s plans for enhancing its technical resiliency to engage more youth.

Experiencing food supply shortages while growing up, Agrawal has written and published his observations about poverty, hunger and climate change in several compelling essays.

“One of the most startling things I’ve noticed is how wasteful the United States is when it comes to food,” Agrawal said. “In India, healthy food is scarce, but in the U.S. there’s plenty of food being grown. Still, it isn’t being properly managed and used by the masses.

“Globally, 40 percent of the world’s food supply is wasted. That amounts to $1 trillion annually.”

Agrawal wrote in his competition essay: “The Mississippi Delta holds some of the most fertile lands in the country for agriculture due to the presence of the Mississippi River. It is best suited for crops like beans, whole grains and the like, that are not only healthy but also sustainable for the environment.

“Instead, the state abundantly cultivates corn and soybeans, crops that wreak havoc on the environment. Farmers only want to grow certain crops that are subsidized by the government under the Farm Bill – corn and soybeans being the two major subsidized crops.”

During the conference in Rome, Agrawal also learned that only 15 people on the earth control $1 trillion of the global economy.

“If just those 15 people were to create an endowment, the interest from it would yield $50 billion, which is enough to get every child on this planet through higher upper secondary education,” he said.

Agrawal’s passion about climate change, agriculture and technology led him to create his own applied research. He is working to create an energy “dashboard” that will measure energy use at Ole Miss.

“I’m seeking to track water and energy utilization in every building across our campus, place the data into a virtual reality software that would allow anyone to monitor all these uses in real time,” Agrawal said. “Several other universities our size already have such capabilities and are using them to optimize energy consumption.

“I’m trying to see that the University of Mississippi keeps up with the issues that affect us all.”

Following the meeting, Agrawal will write another paper about his experiences and submit it to Planet Forward for publication. Ultimately, he hopes to raise awareness and promote activism around climate change.

“Rohan’s extraordinary commitment as citizen and scholar sets him apart not just as a leader in our academic community, but as a distinctive voice within the communities of nations,” said Douglass Sullivan-Gonzalez, Honors College dean. “We are very proud that he represents the SMBHC and our University of Mississippi among national leaders pushing for sustainable development for all peoples.”

At the conference, students participated in extracurricular events, met with experts and shared updates about their experience and takeaways through videos and a blog series.

Engaging college students from across the country, Planet Forward is an initiative of the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs that uses storytelling, media and educational events to tell the stories of invention and innovation.","– Attending an international summit on world food security proved an unforgettable experience for a University of Mississippi junior who was among an elite group selected to attend the event.

The deadly pandemic that tore through the nation’s heartland struck just as Aaron Crawford was in a moment of crisis. He was looking for work, his wife needed surgery, then the virus began eating away at her work hours and her paycheck.

The Crawfords had no savings, mounting bills and a growing dread: What if they ran out of food? The couple had two boys, 5 and 10, and boxes of macaroni and cheese from the dollar store could go only so far.

A 37-year-old Navy vet, Crawford saw himself as self-reliant. Asking for food made him uncomfortable. “I felt like I was a failure,” he says. “It’s this whole stigma ... this mindset that you’re this guy who can’t provide for his family, that you’re a deadbeat.”

Hunger is a harsh reality in the richest country in the world. Even during times of prosperity, schools hand out millions of hot meals a day to children, and desperate elderly Americans are sometimes forced to choose between medicine and food.

Now, in the pandemic of 2020, with illness, job loss and business closures, millions more Americans are worried about empty refrigerators and barren cupboards. Food banks are doling out meals at a rapid pace and an Associated Press data analysis found a sharp rise in the amount of food distributed compared with last year. Meanwhile, some folks are skipping meals so their children can eat and others are depending on cheap food that lacks nutrition.

Those fighting hunger say they’ve never seen anything like this in America, even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The first place many Americans are finding relief is a neighborhood food pantry, most connected to vast networks of nonprofits. Tons of food move each day from grocery store discards and government handouts to warehouse distribution centers, and then to the neighborhood charity.

The Crawfords turned to the Family Resource Centers and Food Shelf, part of 360 Communities, a nonprofit 15 minutes from their apartment in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When needed, they receive monthly boxes of fresh produce, dairy, deli, meat and other basics — enough food to fill two grocery carts. If that runs out, they can get an emergency package to tide them over for the rest of the month.

Crawford’s wife, Sheyla, had insisted they seek help; her hours had been cut at the day care center where she worked. At first, Crawford was embarrassed to go the food shelf; he worried he’d bump into someone he knew. He now sees it differently.

“It didn’t make me a bad man or a terrible husband or father,” he says. “On the contrary, I was actually doing something to make sure that my wife and kids had something thing to eat.”

The history books are filled with iconic images of America’s struggles against hunger. Among the most memorable are the Depression-era photos of men standing in breadlines, huddled in long coats and fedoras, their eyes large with fear. An overhead sign reads: “Free Soup. Coffee and a Doughnut for the Unemployed.”

This year’s portrait of hunger has a distinctively bird’s eye view: Enormous traffic jams captured from drone-carrying cameras. Cars inching along, each driver waiting hours for a box or bag of food. From Anaheim, California to San Antonio, Texas to Toledo, Ohio and Orlando, Florida and points in-between, thousands of vehicles carrying hungry people queued up for miles across the horizon. In New York, and other large cities, people stand, waiting for blocks on end.

The newly hungry have similar stories: Their industry collapsed, they lost a job, their hours were cut, an opportunity fell through because of illness.

Handwritten “closed” signs appeared on the windows of stores and restaurants soon after the pandemic arrived. Paychecks shrank or disappeared altogether as unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7 percent, a rate not seen in almost a century.

Food banks felt the pressure almost immediately.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, scrambled to keep up as states locked down and schools — many providing free breakfasts and lunches — closed. In late March, 20 percent of the organization’s 200 food banks were in danger of running out of food.

The problem with supply subsided, but demand has not. Feeding America has never handed out so much food so fast — 4.2 billion meals from March through October. The organization has seen a 60 percent average increase in food bank users during the pandemic: about 4 in 10 are first-timers.

An AP analysis of Feeding America data from 181 food banks in its network found the organization has distributed nearly 57 percent more food in the third quarter of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

There will be no quick decline as the pandemic rages on, having already claimed more than 280,000 lives and infecting 14.7 million people across the nation.

Feeding America estimates those facing hunger will swell to 1 in 6 people, from 35 million in 2019 to more than 50 million by this year’s end. The consequences are even more dire for children — 1 in 4, according to the group.

Some states have been hit especially hard: Nevada, a tourist mecca whose hotel, casino and restaurant industries were battered by the pandemic, is projected to vault from 20th place in 2018 to 5th place this year in food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America.

In four states — Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana — more than 1 in 5 residents are expected to be food insecure by year’s end, meaning they won’t have money or resources to put food on the table, the report said.

In New Orleans one recent Saturday morning, Donna Duerr was waiting to pick up food in a drive-through donation — something that has become part of her routine since COVID-19 swept in last spring.

Her husband was laid off from his job as a pipefitter and she’s unable to work, having undergone two surgeries — one on her spine, the other on her arm — in the last two months. She also has two grown children who’ve moved home since the pandemic began.

“This is a hard thing to accept that you have to do this,” says a weary-sounding Duerr, her throat covered with bandages as the result of a recent operation. Every morning she monitors the local news for announcements of the next food donation; she tries to attend as many as she can, sometimes sharing the food with less-mobile neighbors.

Duerr, 56, faces painful choices. “I either pay bills or get food,” she says, though these donations have brought some relief.

Norman Butler is another first-timer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he and his girlfriend, Cheryl, arrived at 3 a.m. at a drive-through food bank in a suburban New Orleans sports stadium. They joined a pre-dawn procession of mothers with their kids, the elderly and folks like him — unemployed workers.

“You can see the look of uncertainty on their faces,” he says. “Everybody’s just worried about their next meal.”

Before the pandemic, Butler, 53, flourished in the tourism-dominated city, working as an airport shuttle and limousine driver, a valet and hotel doorman. Since March, when the bustling streets turned silent, jobs in the city have been scarce.

“A lot of people are in limbo,” he says. “The main thing we need is to get back to work.”

Low-wage employees, many in the service industry, have borne the brunt of economic hardship. But the misery has reached deeper into the workforce.

A September report commissioned by the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, found 1 in 4 of those reporting they didn’t have enough to eat typically had incomes above $50,000 a year before the outbreak.

In Anchorage, Alaska, Brian and Airis Messick were coasting along in full-time jobs for companies that support the state’s oil industry. They were moving toward buying a house.

When March arrived, everything unraveled.

Brian, 28, the newest hire at an electrical wiring company, was laid off. Within a week, Airis, an office worker at an oil well testing firm, lost her job, too.

Then it became a monthly game of deciding who gets paid first with their unemployment checks — the landlord or one of the many bills. They kept their car filled with gas in case they had to move.

The Messicks and their 9-year-old son, Jayden, tried to survive on $50 to $75 a week because, she says, “that’s all we could squeeze.” They turned to a food bank for only the second time — they’d sought help after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.

After that devastation, the Messicks, who’d met in Florida, decided to get a fresh start and move to Alaska, where Airis had grown up.

Airis, who just turned 30, found work in August, ironically, at the state unemployment office. “I hear people’s stories all day,” she says. “I listen to moms cry about not having money to take care of their kids. My heart aches for the people who get denied.”

Brian stays home with Jayden, who is autistic, helping him with school and driving him to appointments. Also part of the family are Cleo, a pit bull-lab mix, and Daisy, a bearded dragon.

Airis earns too much for the family to receive state financial aid. Anchorage’s high cost-of-living, partly fueled by the expense of shipping goods to the nation’s most northern state, makes it harder to economize even with coupons and careful shopping.

She says the family will continue to go to the food bank until the economy improves, which she expects won’t be soon.

There should be better systems in place, she says, to help families.

“I feel great knowing that we’re not alone, that we’re, you know, not out here being the only one suffering but,” she says, “it makes me mad to know my government failed us.”

For communities of color, the pandemic has been a compound disaster with Blacks and Latinos reeling from disproportionately high rates of deaths, infections — and joblessness.

Unemployment surged among Latinos to 18.9 percent this spring, higher than any other racial and ethnic group, according to federal statistics. Though it has since fallen, many are still struggling.

More than 1 in 5 Black and Latino adults with children said as of July 2020 they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat, according to the commissioned report. That was double the rate of white and Asian households. It also found that women, households with children and people of color are at greatest risk of hunger.

Abigail Leocadio, 34, first approached the nonprofit Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, Arizona, during hard times about a decade ago. Her family rebounded and she completed training to become a phlebotomist, landing a job drawing blood specimens for a local lab.

Leocadio was just 7 when her family brought her to the U.S. from their native Cuernavaca, Mexico. She currently is protected from deportation and has a work permit through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

When her husband, a restaurant cook, was laid off earlier in the pandemic, her income — barely more than the $11 state minimum wage — wasn’t enough to cover their expenses.

Though they own a two-bedroom trailer, they pay $500 a month to rent the lot. Add to that as much as $450 in monthly electric bills and internet service so their four kids, 9 to 15, can attend class remotely. Before schools closed, the kids received free breakfasts and lunches on campus.

“It has been hard feeding all the kiddos daily,” Leocadio said outside the trailer after a recent delivery from the charity of two boxes including canned tomatoes, dried beans, rice, breakfast cereal and the kids’ undisputed favorite: specialty Oreo cookies.

The food, she says, provides less than half of what her family eats in four weeks, but significantly reduces their monthly bill to about $250. Before the pandemic, the family was saving to buy a house, but that money has been wiped out. Her husband, though, is back at work.

“We always figure out things one way or another,” Leocadio says, though she’s worried about the surge in coronavirus cases and what lies ahead. “We really don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Briana Dominguez had been depending on food pantries in the Chicago area since last fall to supplement her groceries. With two sons, ages 3 and 14, it was hard to keep up, even though she and her boyfriend both worked full-time.

“I never thought it would be me,” she says of her visits to the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois. “But you do what you gotta do to survive.”

A series of misfortunes brought them to a turning point.

Dominguez had a miscarriage, and her father lost his job, due to the pandemic. So did her boyfriend, a trucker. In November her company, which sells ceiling tiles for hospitals and other business, eliminated her job with little notice.

Dominguez, 34, who has a small severance, has decided to move to Georgia, where she has family and living costs are lower. Her boyfriend has found work as a customer service representative that he can do from anywhere, though it’s only $13 an hour. She traveled there in early December to scout job possibilities.

“If I don’t do it now,” she says, “I’ll never do it.”

While food banks have become critical during the pandemic, they’re just one path for combating hunger. For every meal from a food bank, a federal program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, provides nine.

Anti-hunger groups have lobbied Congress for a 15 percent increase in maximum food stamp benefits, A similar measure went a long way in digging the nation out of the Great Recession. A stimulus bill passed by the House this spring includes such a provision, but it has been bogged down in partisan squabbling.

“Food banks and food pantries are doing great work,” says Luis Guardia, president of thee Food Research & Action Center. “But they simply cannot do enough to be something of the order of magnitude that we’re seeing right now. ”

Many going to food pantries also are receiving food stamps, though eligibility varies among states.

Aaron Crawford says the addition of $550 in food stamps the family started receiving last summer has made a significant difference in their lives.

Others have discovered they couldn’t make it without food help, even with Social Security or other benefits.

(AP Video/Martha Irvine)

Phyllis Marder, 66, had both Social Security and unemployment when she arrived at the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois, where she’s lived in the same bungalow for 20 years.

She’d been supplementing her benefits as an Uber drive, and when the pandemic hit, she helped workers bring home their computers and office gear. After that, she ferried medical and other front-line workers, but that came to an abrupt end with a COVID-19 scare.

At first, Marder, didn’t tell anyone about visiting food pantries. Then she had a change of heart. “Keeping a secret makes things get worse,” she says, “… and makes me feel worse about myself, and so I decided that it was more important to talk about it.”

Marder sometimes shared her food with neighbors and a panhandler on a freeway ramp. But she expects her food bank visits will end soon.

In a few days, she starts a job — courtesy of the pandemic.

She’ll be a coronavirus contract tracer, working remotely for a nearby county.

___

As the year nears its end, Crawford is more confident.

The months have been filled with setbacks and successes. Both Crawfords developed mild cases of COVID-19. Sheyla had hysterectomy surgery and was out work without pay for six weeks.

But they’ve rebounded, too.

Crawford has two part-time jobs, one at United Parcel Service, the second as a maintenance worker at a home for the elderly. His wife is back at work at the day care center. And their boys are receiving breakfast and lunch at their school that provides day care.

The financial troubles that brought them to the food bank haven’t disappeared. They still have overdue bills and a car that needs repairs.

But after many dark months, there have been moments of relief. This fall when the couple contracted COVID-19, their sons’ school sent meals and milk to help,

And a friend had an 18-pound turkey delivered for a Thanksgiving feast. It was so big the Crawfords had to figure out how to find room for the leftovers in the refrigerator now stocked with food.

A full fridge, Crawford says, is a welcome sight.

“It just kind of puts you at ease,” he says. “There’s a sense of peace.”

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A new grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service will facilitate scientific exchanges between Mississippi State University and key partners in Africa to support food, plant and animal safety programs.

The $974,000 grant focuses on establishing and harmonizing regulations put forth by the African Union’s Continental Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee by developing knowledge, support and leadership in stakeholders. As part of the grant, MSU will work with African Union administrators, technical experts, as well as representatives from each of Africa’s eight Regional Economic Communities. A team from MSU made a presentation to the African Union committee during a virtual meeting in October.

The goal of the collaboration is to create and implement new standards for the safe trade of agricultural products across the eight Regional Economic Communities of the African Union.

“This project is a great example of the role MSU plays in working to ensure a safe and abundant global food supply,” said MSU Interim Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan. “Together, we will work with the USDA-FAS and strategic partners in Africa to enhance knowledge of food, animal and plant safety, as well as promote food security and economic opportunity across the continent. We look forward to getting this exciting work underway.”

Dr. Margaret Khaitsa, a professor of epidemiology in the university’s College of Veterinary Medicine, will serve as MSU’s lead on the project. A native of Uganda, Khaitsa specializes in large animal herd health and has led multiple initiatives in Africa to support women’s leadership in agriculture. Bryan Farrell, project manager at MSU’s International Institute, also will help manage the project.

“Food borne illness and death is a major concern across Africa,” Khaitsa said. “The MSU team is very honored to be aiding in the human capital development of individuals to address the complex issue of increasing food safety.”

MSU will recruit and identify 24 people to become fellows of a new scientific exchange program, with representation from each Regional Economic Community. The university and USDA-FAS will work together to initiate meetings with leaders in Washington, D.C. Additionally, MSU will host science and technical experts from the group on campus to share expertise and best practices in specific areas. Each expert will be assigned a faculty mentor while on campus.

33,33,"Nov 30, 2018",Ole Miss News,Office of Food and Nutrition Security Opens at South Oxford Center,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The School of Applied Sciences at the University of Mississippi has opened a new Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the South Oxford Center.

Although David H. Holben, professor of nutrition and hospitality management, has been producing food security research at UM since he arrived in 2015, he and his students finally have devoted space to analyze data, conduct focus groups and interviews, and engage with community members.

“My vision for the Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the University of Mississippi is to be the recognized leader in providing innovative solutions for food insecurity in Mississippi, the United States and the world,” said Holben, who has been studying the problem since 1997.

“I’m hoping that we can have a global impact. I think (establishing a formal office) just reinforces the support that the university and the school have for this issue of food insecurity.”

Food insecurity is a lack of regular access to enough food to maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. According to the USDA’s 2017 estimates, some 15 million American households were food insecure.

More than 13 percent of rural households reported food insecurity, much higher than those in metropolitan areas. Between 2015 and 2017, food insecurity in Mississippi was among the highest in the nation, at 17.2 percent.

The university community is committed to helping solve this problem through its Flagship Constellations initiative, which seeks to find meaningful solutions through multidisciplinary response to health and social issues affecting Mississippi communities, the nation and the world. One of those constellations is Community Wellbeing, which works to find solutions to the challenges affecting rural communities to build stronger and more vibrant communities.

Holben brings food security expertise and research from the Office of Food and Nutrition Security to this collaboration.

Students and staff conducting research through the Office of Food and Nutrition Security have presented their findings at international conferences, including discussions of seven studies at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ annual conference in October.

Doctoral student Prabhdeep Sandha, of Jalandhar City, India, earned the Mead Johnson Nutrition/Research Dietetic Practice Group Student Research Award at the conference for her study, “Impact of a Produce Intervention on Parental Produce Intake and Behaviors,” co-authored by fellow graduate student Michelle Weber, of Cincinnati.

“Our (office) is continuously working to make a difference in Mississippi through fresh produce and healthy food interventions, community engagement and community education,” Sandha said. “With our previous projects, we were able to see some great results, which I hope will be evident in our future projects.”

Undergraduate students also are gaining research skills through the new office. Katelyn Tarr, a junior dietetics and nutrition major from Pawnee, Illinois, presented a study on “Food insecurity and type 2 diabetes risk of adults with school children” at the conference, with funding from the first Undergraduate Travel Grant awarded by the UM Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.

“Dr. Holben brought me in to learn how to write an abstract and make a poster for a conference, which is something that graduate students would normally do,” Tarr said. “It really helped me prepare for my post-graduate career.

“I was excited to work on nutrition research, but it turns out this really hits close to home for me. I’m from an area that has high food insecurity, so it was awesome to be a part of that.”

Five of the abstracts presented at conference stem from the Farm-to-YOUth! Project that Holben and his students have been working on since 2016, studying varying nutritional and educational interventions and their impact on food security in a rural Mississippi county.

From produce tastings and take-home produce for elementary school children to summer nutrition education and feeding programs at the public library, the faculty-student team has examined different ways to improve food security for people living in rural areas.

This fall, the office rolled out a new study in Calhoun County to examine food education interventions for high school athletes.

Holben, along with an external consultant, develops the twice-weekly programming that includes a lesson, snack and educational handouts. Graduate students Marta Dees, of Oxford, and Rebecca Henry, of The Plains, Virginia, teach the lessons and give each football player a take-home bag of fuel for the week, including peanut butter, yogurt, fresh fruit and granola bars, to implement the practices at home.

“We’re primarily hoping to change the food environment at home,” Holben said. “They’re learning eight to 10 basic principles about food and nutrition that we’re helping them to implement through take-home food packages.

“I think we can play a really key role in teaching basic sport nutrition principles to high schoolers, while keeping performance nutrition at the forefront of the coach’s mind. The hope is we can fill in the gap if they do have food insecurity in the home to help them to implement some performance nutrition principles since they’re athletes.”

Holben, lead author of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ most recent position paper on food insecurity in the United States, is elated with the opportunities that come with having an official office at the South Oxford Center. He looks forward to playing a significant role in fulfilling the university’s commitment to creating healthier, more vibrant communities.

34,34,"Dec 26, 2018",Mississippi Today,Gloster’s first grocery store in decades highlights statewide food insecurity,"GLOSTER — For residents here, food excursions would range from the 30 minute round-trip to Centreville, to the 2-hour round-trip to Baton Rouge, La. The nearest Walmart and Kroger, over in McComb, are roughly an hour’s drive each way.

A small rural town in Amite County, Gloster is just south of the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi; it’s less than two square miles in size and home to around a thousand residents, according to the 2016 American Community Survey.

Companies are scared, despite minimal competition, that they won’t make enough of a profit to survive in towns with a small consumer base — towns like Gloster. In a sparsely populated state like Mississippi, this is a common dilemma, especially when it comes to access to food.

But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving. The town’s first grocery store in decades.

“We needed this,” said Felecia Nayland, 56, who’s lived in Gloster all her life. I just hope and pray that they continue to do good business here so they’ll stay here.”

Nayland said previously, access to fruits and vegetables in town was “pretty much non-existent.”

Limited access to grocery stores in rural areas is one reason Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Over half a million Mississippians did not know where their next meal would come from between 2015 and 2017, according to the latest report from Hunger Free America, “The Red, White, and Blue Hunger Wave: A 2018 United States Hunger Atlas.”

Many here see the public-private partnership that brought the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Gloster as part of the solution to an all-too-common problem in rural towns around the state — availability of affordable, fresh food.

Lavonne Sanders, 50, has also lived in Gloster her whole life, and said the last time the town had a store like this was when she was a little girl, about 30-40 years ago. That too was a Piggly Wiggly.

“I love this store, it’s made a big change,” Sanders said. “We don’t have to go Centreville anymore. You don’t have to spend that gas money now.”

While the store licenses the Piggly Wiggly brand, the shop itself is independently owned and operated by Jason Cook. Cook, from Hattiesburg, learned about Gloster a few years ago while at a previous job. The company was considering expansion into the small town, but in the end opted against it. Since then, Cook opened a Piggly Wiggly in Angie, La. — but he didn’t forget about Gloster.

“I came back here when I was financially able to,” Cook said, “just because after having talks with the community I knew how bad it was here. So the Lord led us back here.

“Most companies will turn their nose up at a store doing under $100,000 a week in sales. My approach is a little different; I do it to operate a business, but I also do it out of just having humanity and compassion. The way I do things aren’t necessarily the way anyone else does them.”

The city approved a tax incentive for the store, which will reimburse Cook for exterior improvements like the parking lot and sidewalk repair. Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened. The store created 22 jobs.

“If you can get into a town where the government will help you get established there to lower your overhead (cost), then you can make it,” Cook said. “You don’t get greedy, and you don’t take advantage of people, you just operate. I live within my means. I’ve got to make a profit in order to pay the bills, but I’m not trying to become a millionaire off of it.”

After years of driving out of town, often out of county, to find fresh produce and essentials, residents were prepared to fill Piggly Wiggly; by 3 p.m. on a Monday, the grocery store was the busiest place in Gloster.

“It’s brought some life back to the town,” said Rachel Stevens, 54, who works at a business on Main St. around the corner from the new store.

Stevens and other residents discussed having to cram all their grocery shopping into a couple trips a month.

“We’d have to stock up. It’s really inconvenient when you run out of stuff. We had no choice, no options,” she added.

More than just the convenience, residents think the Piggly Wiggly will lift spirits and create momentum for the town.

“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago. “I knew it was hyped up when people, even in the other counties, would say, ‘Did you hear about the Piggly Wiggly?’ It’s the biggest thing in a long time in this area.”

“It’s gonna be some more changes coming,” Sanders said. “I believe.”

“To hear over the course of several years how badly a grocery store was needed and wanted in the town, and now that the town finally has it, it really is a feeling of bliss and happiness,” said Rep. Angela Cockerham, D-Magnolia, who represents Amite County.

Cockerham, an attorney at Wise Carter, also serves as Gloster’s lawyer. She added that the incentives Piggly Wiggly received could help attract business in other places in Mississippi.

“In the future, I’m hoping that there will be other mechanisms that will help areas like Southwest Mississippi that encourage partnership (between towns and businesses),” she said.

Statewide solutions and the Legislature’s role

Much of the state — about 1 in 5, according to Hunger Free America — struggle with consistent access to nutritional food.

The phenomenon ranges from urban areas, like Hinds County, where 1 in 4 are food insecure, to rural areas like Jefferson County, which had the highest food insecurity rate in the country in 2016 at 36 percent, according to Feeding America.

Can the public-private partnership in Gloster work in the rest of the state? What can the state Legislature do to help?

Every year, lawmakers propose legislation ultimately aimed at reducing food insecurity by either helping grocers located in low-income communities mitigate losses or making groceries more affordable for the general public.

Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Jackson, has pushed for legislation to give tax credits to grocers locating in underserved communities. A 2018 bill would have given these stores a job tax credit equaling 10 percent of its payroll.

Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, authored a 2018 bill to give income tax credits to grocers to offset the cost of purchasing locally grown produce in an attempt to incentivize stores offering healthier food options.

Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, has introduced bills for the last several years to allow state funds to be used as a direct source of funding for grocery stores under the Small Business and Grocer Investment Act passed in 2014.

Each of these bills died in committee with little fanfare.

Simmons said his proposal to use state dollars directly is unlikely to garner the support of leadership. Tax incentives, similar to those Mississippi gives large companies like Nissan and Continental Tire, might be more palatable, Simmons said.

Right now, Mississippi is leveraging tax incentives for industries to locate in the state, but those benefits do not apply to businesses like grocers.

“Because of the number of employees, the kind of wages they’re paying, (grocers) wouldn’t qualify for the same type of incentives that an industry would,” Simmons said.

The federal government’s primary vehicle for providing at least some food to the poor is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly allowances based on the size of the recipient’s household. Mississippi has one of the largest federal matches of any state for these assistance programs.

“We in Mississippi have depended so much on the federal government to feed the hungry in the state that we ourselves are not focused on it,” Simmons said. “We have not stepped up to the plate to give adequate dollars to match that to help those citizens out of their particular situation … We’ve not had to.”

To slightly ease the burden of affording groceries for Mississippi residents, Rep. Jeramey Anderson, D-Escatawpa, repeatedly proposes legislation to remove the sales tax levied on food items for all shoppers. SNAP purchases are already exempt from sales tax. A version of the same bill from Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, would have also increased all other sales tax from seven to nine percent.

“In my opinion, the best way to provide a tax cut to our constituents, especially those in the middle and working class, is to eliminate this sales tax (on food),” said Anderson, who plans on reintroducing the bill next session. “And I know that of course there has to be a make-up of the revenue lost from taxes on groceries, but I think phasing it out, which is what this bill does over five years, is a responsible way of doing that without hitting the state’s revenue so hard. I think the sales tax on groceries is one of, if not the most, regressive taxes we have.”

Both bills also died, as well as several bills to raise the state minimum wage, which currently mirrors the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, to between $8.25 and $10.10.

Considering low wages across the state, Mississippi families cannot always rely on a job to provide food security. The “U.S. Hunger Atlas” also shows that nearly 13 percent of working adults, or 156,213 employees, also faced food insecurity between 2015 and 2017.

The report also calculated that Mississippi residents would need to spend an additional $273 million each year on food to meet their basic nutritional needs. That’s roughly one-third the amount Mississippi spent, $841.8 million, through the SNAP program in 2017.

“When you get into a situation and you do it for so long, it just becomes a way of life,” Simmons said. “If we do more at the state level, we could actually become a state of change, where we are transitioning our people from poverty to prosperity.”

At the Mississippi Center for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on racial and economic issues, Madeline Morcelle and Kathryn Rehner promote a wide-range of solutions to tackle the root causes of food insecurity.

“In order to achieve a food secure Mississippi, the state legislature will need to take on a broad range of social, economic, and physical barriers to healthy food access,” Morcelle said. “Those include everything from poverty, which is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of people still aren’t paid a living wage; measures to improve the minimum wage would improve food security. I think tax incentives and other measures to incentivize investments from food retailers are important.

“Ultimately, though, there isn’t one solution. It will take a combination of state reform addressing the multiplicity of factors that result in food insecurity, from lack of transportation, to inadequate income, to lack of opportunity in many communities, to protecting and strengthening our essential nutritional assistance programs like SNAP that provide that emergency lifeline to struggling families.”","But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving.
The town’s first grocery store in decades.
Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened.
“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago.

STARKVILLE, Miss. —More than a dozen high school students participated in the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute on Friday [March 23] at Mississippi State University.

Hosted by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, students from across Mississippi spent the day engaged in conversation about global food security with their peers, teachers, MSU faculty and administrators and various food security experts.

Attendees were officially designated Borlaug Scholars for their participation and are eligible for scholarships to Mississippi State University. The Borlaug Scholars pay tribute to the World Food Prize’s founder Norman E. Borlaug. To become a Borlaug Scholar, each student wrote a research paper about a developing country and a food security topic. Each project included innovative ways to improve global food security. The students presented their findings at the on-campus event.

“The Mississippi Youth Institute is a partnership program with the World Food Prize. It challenges high school students to explore the world’s most pressing issues related to food security,” said Libby Crimmings, the World Food Prize’s national education program director. “The World Food Prize’s founder, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was passionate about working with students. He believed if you want people solving these challenges when they are 60 years old, they have to be thinking about it when they are 16 years old.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a global food security champion, welcomed the students in an opening session.

“By 2050, the world population will surpass 10 billion. That means we will need to feed an additional 3 billion people at our global dinner table by the time this class of Borlaug Scholars reaches their 40s,” Keenum said. “That’s why we need young talented students like this who take an interest in the future of the world to try and make a difference, serve humanity and address these critical challenges.”

“It’s also why Mississippi State, as a leading land-grant research institution trained on improving food security on a global scale, is tackling many of these problems today. We are trying to address these challenges through science and research to figure out how we can advance productivity so we can feed the world.” Keenum added.

Scott Willard, associate dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, along with support from the entire MSU Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine administration, has been instrumental in seeing this institute come to fruition.

“Our college is thrilled to host the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute. Achieving global food security is essential as it becomes evident that we must feed more people with fewer resources,” Willard said. “This program provides a platform for high school students to formulate novel solutions to help solve one of the most pressing needs of their generation.”

Students also attended the college’s Charles E. Lindley Lecture. Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, presented on hunger in the Magnolia State. His presentation, “Mississippi: The Hungriest State in the Nation” explained how MFN is addressing food insecurity.

Top students from World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute will be invited to the Global Youth Institute in Iowa in October. Participating students also are eligible to apply to the Borlaug Ruan International Internship and the USDA Wallace-Carver Fellowship.

36,36,"Aug 15, 2019",Washington Post,"Investigators believe five poultry companies violated immigration law, search warrants say","Since 2002, federal officials have reported more than 350 encounters or arrests of undocumented people who said they worked at two of the plants, Koch Foods and Peco Foods.

AD

AD

The companies for years have employed a stream of Guatemalan and Mexican immigrants who are not authorized to work in the United States, according to the search warrant affidavits, unsealed in federal court after Aug. 7 raids on seven plants operated by Koch Foods, Peco Foods, PH Food, A&B and Pearl River Foods. In the affidavits, Homeland Security Investigations agent Anthony Todd Williams Jr. said there is probable cause to believe that the chicken plants in Mississippi intentionally hired undocumented workers who presented fraudulent documents “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.”

Williams wrote that individuals or companies shown to have “actual knowledge” of violating the employment law — meaning they knowingly hired at least 10 people not authorized to work for a year-long period — can be fined as much as $3,000 per undocumented worker. Employers can be imprisoned for as long as six months.

Neither the companies nor any executives have been charged with violating immigration law, although the documents name numerous managers who apparently knew about the widespread practice, according to the affidavits recently unsealed in Mississippi federal court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out the raids at seven chicken-processing plants operated by the companies, arresting 680 workers, about half of whom have been released to await further hearings.

ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said no charges have been filed against either workers or employers since the raids.

AD

AD

“No federal law enforcement agency is going to speculate as to if/when any federal criminal charges may be filed … as that is the sole decision of the U.S. Attorney’s office,” he wrote in an email.

Mike Hurst, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, said in a statement that he could not comment on the case because the investigation is ongoing. “If you look at the history of this office, we have consistently prosecuted employers, companies and owners when evidence has been presented to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they have violated federal criminal laws.”

Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center, told The Washington Post that in his experience as a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer, such cases are time-consuming.

AD

“Federal agents no doubt seized servers, hundreds of personnel files and thousands of additional documents to be analyzed and considered by agents and federal prosecutors,” Johnson said. “The fact that no corporate officials were hauled out in handcuffs on the day of the raid is not the least bit surprising.”

AD

The records detail how ICE linked undocumented immigrants to the companies. Investigators found some employees via GPS coordinates at plants operated by all five companies. The employees previously had been arrested by Border Patrol agents in California, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona and released on electronic-monitoring programs, including ankle bracelets, to await court dates. In each case cited, the individuals listed addresses in small towns in central Mississippi where they could be located.

An undocumented Mexican woman working in a Peco Foods plant in Bay Springs, Miss., told immigration officials that she had come to the state because people in Mexico had told her that jobs were available at the chicken plants there.

AD

In cases cited in the affidavits, people on ICE’s electronic-monitoring programs were not authorized to work. But according to the affidavits, dozens of employees in such programs were found working at the seven chicken plants in 2018 and 2019. One successful job applicant was told by a supervisor during her interview that she would need to keep her ankle monitor charged while she worked.

AD

Immigration officials in Jackson, Miss., say they investigated the plants by working with employees who were acting as confidential informants, coordinating with local police on traffic stops and culling records from jails and detention centers, among other forms of surveillance.

Since 2008, Mississippi has required companies to use E-Verify, a federal employment verification system that checks an applicant’s information against a variety of federal databases. However, the system only checks the names, Social Security numbers and other information supplied by the applicant, so it cannot always detect whether an employee’s application uses falsified documents.

AD

Koch Foods, Peco Foods and PH Food issued public statements saying that they use the federal system, which compares an employee’s identity across databases. One of the search warrants lists the names of 25 PH Food employees whose names had not been run through E-Verify.

AD

On Friday, Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr and acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan asking for documents detailing the cost of the raids, information on the detained workers and any past or current criminal charges against the companies that employed them.

“It appears that these DOJ and ICE enforcement actions are targeting only immigrant workers and not their employers,” the letter reads.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) is one of the top two recipients in Congress of campaign contributions from the egg and poultry industry, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. The Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith’s campaign is a top recipient of donations from the National Chicken Council PAC, to which both Peco Foods and Koch Foods executives donate.

AD

AD

Hyde-Smith, a former Mississippi agriculture commissioner, did not respond to requests for comment from The Post.

Here’s what the newly unsealed federal documents allege about the five companies whose plants were raided Aug. 7:

Koch Foods

Headquartered near Chicago, privately held Koch Foods produces more than 700,000 tons of chicken products each year in its plant in Morton, Miss. The Koch Foods plant in Morton was raided after immigration officials said they received multiple tips that the plant knew it was employing immigrants not authorized to work in the United States.

Officials have reported 144 encounters, including arrests, since 2002 with undocumented immigrants who said they worked at a Koch Foods plant in Mississippi. ICE found that 21 employees of the Koch Foods plant in Morton are enrolled in the agency’s electronic-monitoring program, which tracks people who have been arrested on immigration violations and are awaiting court dates. Except in rare cases, such individuals are not authorized to work.

A Guatemalan woman who worked at the Morton plant since November 2016 told immigration officials in May that when she applied for employment, her first application was denied.

AD

AD

“She was told by a Human Resources (HR) employee (unidentified female) at the plant that if the ‘papers’ were not good, she was not going to be hired,” according to the affidavit by agent Williams.

About three weeks later, the woman used another name to send application materials to the same Koch human resources employee and was hired. “Even though she returned to the plant within three weeks and used two different identities, the HR employee did not ask anything related to her identity,” it says.

The Guatemalan woman told authorities that a Koch supervisor asked her whether she had an electronic-monitoring ankle bracelet, which she did. The supervisor told her “he knew ‘they’ were poor and came to the United States to work,” according to the affidavit.

AD

Officials also talked to a Guatemalan woman who said that she first worked at the Koch Foods plant in Morton in 2017. She received permission to work from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018 and asked a co-worker whether she should talk to human resources about changing her employment documents to reflect her real name. The co-worker advised her to quit and reapply instead. So she did and was hired the same day at the other Koch plant in Morton, with no questions about her identity.

AD

Koch spokesman Jim Gilliland told The Post that Koch Foods risked violating federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of national origin for requesting documents beyond what an applicant provides, if those materials appear authentic.

“Forms of identification can look completely authentic and jibe with the person who is sitting in front of us. … So you take what you’re given, and you enter that into the E-Verify system,” Gilliland said.

He said the company never knowingly employed people who presented false documentation to work.

This is not the first time federal immigration agents have raided a Koch Foods plant: 161 employees were arrested in 2007 at a plant in Fairfield, Ohio. The company paid a fine of more than $500,000 for violating immigration laws in 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Peco Foods

Alabama-based Peco Foods, the eighth-largest poultry producer in the country, operated three of the Mississippi processing plants raided last week. The privately operated company is headed by President Mark Hickman, whose grandfather founded the company in 1937.

“We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and are navigating a potential disruption of operations,” the company told The Post in a statement.

According to the search warrant affidavits, 21 people enrolled in the electronic-monitoring program are employed at Peco plants in Mississippi. Authorities had 222 encounters with undocumented Peco employees between 2002 and 2019, the affidavits state.

Officials linked at least seven undocumented Guatemalans to one of the plants, including a worker who said he worked there for 12 years.

Since 2012, immigration officials reported encountering at least five undocumented Mexicans and Guatemalans who said they worked at the Peco plants in Bay Springs and Canton, Miss. Federal investigators worked with a former employee at the company’s Bay Springs plant as a confidential informant to videotape a conversation with a Peco Foods human resources employee, who said the plant has hired multiple employees twice but with different identities.

According to the affidavit, the human resources employee told the informant: “Peco Foods management does not care” about employing immigrants with questionable documentation.

The affidavit lists ICE’s first contact with the Sebastopol plant as July 2014, when officials asked a human resources manager to locate a Guatemalan man using someone else’s name for his employment. ICE arrested the man and reported encounters with at least nine more undocumented Guatemalans between August 2015 and June 2019 who said they worked at the plant.

PH Food and A&B

In the affidavit, Williams states that two of the plants ICE raided last week are owned by the same man: Huo You Liang, also known as “Victor” Liang. The chicken-processing plants are A&B, in Pelahatchie, Miss., and PH Food, in Morton, Miss.

A man who answered the phone at PH Food on Thursday asked whether a reporter was calling and before hanging up said he could not answer questions. A&B did not respond to requests for comment.

PH Food, which lost dozens of workers to arrest Aug. 7, laid off another 100 workers on Monday without explanation, attorneys for several workers told The Post. It is unclear whether the layoffs are related to the raid. Former employees and their allies gathered in a Morton park on Tuesday for a demonstration.

Ahorita en Morton, MS la gente se ha reunido a protestar años de maltrató e injusticia tras la redada en PH Foods (Los Chinos). Posted by Mississippi Resiste on Tuesday, August 13, 2019

In February, an employee at PH Food gave immigration officials information showing that both plants were employing workers without legal documentation and that they use a payroll company in Louisiana to file the paperwork and shift the blame.

In May, officials recorded a conversation between the informant and Heather Carrillo, whom the affidavit lists as the secretary responsible for new employee paperwork at both plants. Carrillo told the informant that if immigration authorities had questions, she would direct them to Shreveport, La., where the payroll company is located, the affidavit states.

In May, immigration officials reviewed E-Verify records for the names and Social Security numbers given by 20 PH Food employees. They found that neither PH Foods nor its payroll provider had checked E-Verify for those names, even though the companies searched 1,000 other names in the system.

The Louisiana payroll company — PMI Resource — as well as PH Food and A&B “do not verify the authenticity of their documents,” according to the affidavit. Although E-Verify is federally a voluntary system, Mississippi state law requires companies to use E-Verify.

Despite the affidavit’s allegation that at least 20 employees’ names were not put through E-Verify, Carrillo told The Post last week that the business uses E-Verify in hiring. A woman who answered the phone at PMI Resource on Wednesday declined to answer questions.

Both the informant and an undocumented employee said 70 of 80 total employees at A & B’s plant were undocumented immigrants, most from Guatemala and a few from Mexico. The affidavit states that 224 of 240 PH Food workers are “suspected to be” undocumented, with 22 employees at the two plants enrolled in ICE’s electronic-monitoring program.

Pearl River Foods

The fifth company whose employees were swept up in the ICE raids, Pearl River Foods, opened its plant in Carthage, Miss., two years ago, and its success has been touted by the state’s governor.

When the Carthage plant handed over information about its 337 employees to immigration authorities in February, investigators allege they found some employees using the names and Social Security numbers of other people, including the deceased. Three months later, when ICE asked for the plant’s E-Verify list, 306 employees were listed as having been previously searched in the system.

The affidavit said 19 undocumented employees were enrolled in the electronic-monitoring program.

Pearl River opened its $2 million chicken-processing plant in 2017 and created 600 jobs within a year, according to a news release by the state economic development authority.

“The addition of so many new jobs by Pearl River Foods in Leake County speaks to the company’s commitment to doing business in Mississippi and to its strong belief in the people of our great state,” Gov. Phil Bryant (R) said at the time.","The Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith’s campaign is a top recipient of donations from the National Chicken Council PAC, to which both Peco Foods and Koch Foods executives donate.

37,37,"Sep 7, 2020",PBS NewsHour,"Southern Africa’s increased food insecurity blamed on climate, COVID-19","JOHANNESBURG (AP) — An estimated 45 million people in southern Africa are food insecure, with the number of people without access to adequate affordable and nutritious food up 10% from last year, the World Food Program said Monday.

The COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with climate change and the struggling economies of several countries, are the main causes of the food insecurity, said international aid organizations in a webinar organized by the Foreign Correspondents Association of Southern Africa.

Zimbabwe is the worst affected country, with its number of food insecure people expected to reach 8.6 million by the end of this year, World Food Program director in southern Africa, Lola Castro, said.

“We are going to see levels of food insecurity that we have never seen for many years,” in 13 of the region’s 16 countries, Castro said.

“We have chronic underlying causes that we know very well, and they are basically mostly related to climatic shocks … drought, floods or big cyclones,” said Castro.

WATCH: How the pandemic is making a global food crisis worse

She said COVID-19 was an additional emergency that has enormously hurt the livelihoods of many poor people in the region. Lockdowns have made large numbers of people unemployed, increasing food insecurity, she said.

Many farmers, especially women, had been severely affected by COVID-19 and its impact on food production, said ActionAid Africa humanitarian advisor, Chikondi Chabvuta.

“Southern Africa has faced impacts of climate change for the past four years nonstop. … I have witnessed the short-lived hope in people’s eyes these past four years when seeds are distributed or exchanged in the hope for a better yield next season, only to be disappointed by more climate disasters,” she said.

“COVID-19 is exposing the existing systematic weaknesses of the regional policies meant to develop resilient food security,” said Chabvuta. “This includes reliance on imports for agricultural production for food supply.”

Zimbabwean farmer Juliet Hove said lack of access to water and the markets were also major problems for small-scale farmers in her country.

According to Hove, COVID-19 restrictions on movements were preventing small-scale farmers from traveling to marketplaces to sell seeds and produce, reducing their ability to earn an income.","JOHANNESBURG (AP) — An estimated 45 million people in southern Africa are food insecure, with the number of people without access to adequate affordable and nutritious food up 10% from last year, the World Food Program said Monday.

38,38,"Sep 11, 2020",PBS NewsHour,1 in 10 Americans don’t have enough food. The pandemic is making things worse,"Tens of millions of Americans were already wrestling with having enough food to eat before the coronavirus came along. Enter a pandemic that launched an historic recession and experts say that need has only grown.

For three years, Jennifer Lawrence has volunteered at the food bank at St. Luke Methodist Church in Tupelo, Mississippi. People who come to her are scared, not only about having enough food but also how they’re going to make it from one day to the next in the middle of COVID-19, she said. One woman in her 70s is now raising her grandchildren after her own child died, Lawrence said.

“Some of them are at their wit’s end,” she said, adding that her clients tell her, “‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”

“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.'”

Data is starting to catch up to the real-life fallout of dueling health and economic crises, and shows that households of color and those with less income are disproportionately affected so far. In late August, about one in 10 Americans said they did not have enough food in the last seven days, according to new survey data from the Census Bureau out this week. But mounting data suggests those numbers are going up. The Census data also revealed rising in food insufficiency among children over the summer, from 16.8 percent in mid-June to 19.9 percent by mid-July.

In New York City and Los Angeles, roughly one-fifth of residents said over the course of July that they had serious difficulty getting enough food to eat. In Houston, a third of respondents had trouble affording food, according to a poll from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, NPR and Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health

And a slew of COVID-19 relief packages — from unemployment assistance to housing protection — are set to expire by the end of September, weeks ahead of the 2020 presidential election, leaving millions of people vulnerable to worse economic and health outcomes.

Food is one of the first costs people skimp on to try and stay afloat amid turbulent financial straits, and one of the last basic needs to recover once a crisis eases. What someone spends on food “is something that is elastic, as opposed to — your rent is your rent,” said Elaine Waxman, senior fellow at the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

That deprivation can have lasting effects — trouble getting enough food to eat can lay the foundation for chronic illness and reduced health outcomes later in life.

The PBS NewsHour asked health and social safety net experts where the United States stands on food insecurity, who is being hit hardest and what would help people get enough to eat during this crisis.

How we got here

Late last year, before the global rise of COVID-19, one out of 10 U.S. households was food insecure, according to a report published this week from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That amounts to an estimated 35.2 million people, said Alisha Coleman-Jensen, a USDA social science analyst who studies nutrition assistance.

More than half of those households — 58 percent — participated in at least one of the nation’s largest federal nutrition programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and the National School Lunch Program.

Rising unemployment and inflation of food prices are often linked to the number of food-insecure households, Coleman-Jensen said. However, “most food-insecure households are actually employed,” either full-time or part-time, suggesting people’s paychecks don’t go far enough to cover the cost of food, she said during a webinar highlighting the latest USDA report’s findings.

These numbers are comparable to what the Census Bureau found when it asked Americans if they had enough food during the last seven days. For months, the bureau has inquired how households are coping during the pandemic with questions about job status, housing, food, health care and more.

But the way that question is framed could gloss over the realities of food insecurity, which tends to be episodic during the course of a month, Waxman said. People may be fine once they get money or assistance on the first of the month, but by the end of the month, their cash reserves or resources may have dried up. That’s why polls often ask if people have experienced hunger or food insecurity over the last 30 days.

For many in the U.S., financial stability has grown more tenuous in the months since the pandemic began, and could get more dire. With the latest GOP Senate coronavirus relief bill scuttled on Thursday, essentially diminishing hopes of any aid coming before the November election, and federal COVID-19 unemployment insurance set to expire after Dec. 31, more people are struggling to figure out how they will pay rent and eat, Waxman said. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed a federal moratorium on evictions, people are still worried about how they are going to make ends meet. Back in Tupelo, Lawrence said clients come to her and say they don’t know how they can afford rent.

In a year full of examples of the ways systemic racism manifests in all aspects of life, from COVID-19 outcomes to police brutality, food insecurity has also weighed more heavily on Black and brown households than white ones, said Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The health care policy organization, along with partners, surveyed 3,454 Americans between July 1 and Aug. 3 in the nation’s four largest cities — New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston — to see how vulnerable people’s lives and livelihoods have become amid the pandemic. The report detailed how problems were concentrated among Black and Latino households and households with incomes less than $100,000 per year in cities that report some of the nation’s highest cost-of-living. At least half of respondents in each city reported serious financial problems, including trouble paying bills, especially due to medical costs or credit card debt, and fleeced savings.

“Food security is really a basic and fundamental need, and we shouldn’t be experiencing these kinds of problems,” Morita said.

On the ground

After COVID-19 surged in places like New York City and California, it settled into rural pockets of the country over the summer, searing states like Mississippi with some of the country’s worst positivity rates, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Mississippians still suffered among the higher unemployment rates in the country with 10.8 percent of the labor force out of work. And like much of the rest of the country, a disproportionate number of Black Mississippians died after they were infected with the virus, compared to white Mississippians, according to the state department of public health.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry.”

Things got so bad that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves finally issued a statewide face mask mandate on Aug. 4, but stopped short of postponing the start of in-person school days later for thousands of Mississippi children, teachers and staff. Less than a month after classes began, the Mississippi Free Press reported on Aug. 25 that thousands were ordered to stay out of classrooms after hundreds of COVID-19 tests confirmed positive cases in the state’s school system. In the 2019-2020 school year, the USDA said about 357,000 children in Mississippi were qualified to be fed through the National School Lunch Program. That translates to nearly three-quarters of all children in the state’s participating schools.

Mississippi households reported the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity at 15.7 percent late last year, according to the latest USDA data. Since then, Jason Martin has already seen a spike in need at the food pantries he oversees in Northeast Mississippi. As executive director for the Tupelo/Lee County Hunger Coalition, Martin said older residents, who are at greater risk for suffering worse outcomes if infected with COVID-19, fear coming to the pantries to pick up food. At the same time, hundreds of new households are flocking to the food bank because so many people have lost their jobs or been furloughed.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry,” Martin said. He said while the pantry typically restricts people to one visit per month, Martin said he has seen an uptick in people who run out and need more food sooner.

Around the nation, more than four out of 10 people who sought help from food pantries were new and needed services as a result of COVID-19, according to Feeding America, a nonprofit network of more than 200 food banks. Based on what he has seen, Martin said he doesn’t expect food pantry demand to return to pre-pandemic numbers “until 2021, until a vaccine is widely available. You’ve got to see that widely available to the community before things start stabilizing.”

What’s next?

Waxman said she foresees “a real uptick in food insecurity and need” for months, if not years. It took Americans a decade to recover from food insecurity brought on by the Great Recession, she said.

The U.S. didn’t enter this coronavirus-fueled recession completely unprepared. During the 2008 financial crisis, lessons were learned that gave policymakers evidence-based tools and strategies to make sure more Americans get enough nutritious food to eat, she said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping. That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”

One tool they used to stem widespread hunger in the U.S. was boosting food stamp benefits across the board, Waxman said. That gave more food to more people when they needed it, and research supports this tactic for avoiding hunger. That’s why it was included in the HEROES Act, Waxman said, but that coronavirus relief package, which was introduced by House Democrats in May, has sat in Congress.

Research shows that cash infusions, such as the extended $600 payments that went out under the CARES Act passed in March, are vital in keeping American households financially afloat and fed, Waxman said. During the Great Recession, individuals received more than $420 billion in stimulus payments, which helped keep households afloat and prevent further job loss, the Hamilton Project reported.

To fix holes in the social safety net, Waxman urged lawmakers to be more consistent with aid. So far in the crisis, the U.S. has adopted a series of policies that weren’t renewed. One example, she said, was authorizing pandemic EBT, or a special debit card used to redeem food benefits, under the CARES Act, which replaced free or reduced price school meals for children who couldn’t return to the classroom because of COVID-19 and would miss free-or-reduced price breakfast and lunch. This benefit is set to expire on Sept. 30. According to the USDA, roughly 30 million children rely on the National School Lunch Program. But because the U.S. has created a patchwork of state, local and federal responses to a global pandemic, more households are falling through the cracks, Waxman said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping,” she said. “That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”","I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it.

39,39,"Nov 12, 2020",,Some U.S. states hit harder by COVID-19 food insecurity,"Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic. But large regional differences exist in the severity of the impact.

Experts project over 50 million Americans will be food insecure in 2020, including about 17 million children, says Craig Gundersen, ACES distinguished professor in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois.

Gundersen estimated food insecurity using Map the Meal Gap, an interactive model he developed for Feeding America, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks in the U.S. For the current report, he combined MMG data with projected unemployment numbers.

""One of the key things about COVID-19 is how there's differential impacts across the country and by demographic groups. People with college education generally have not seen much of an impact on either unemployment rates or incomes. However, people in lower-wage jobs tend to be impacted a lot more,"" Gundersen states. ""We would expect greater impact of COVID-19 in areas with a high concentration of service industry jobs.""

The report finds the hardest hit states are the same as before the pandemic -- Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico - but with higher rates. Jefferson County, Mississippi, has the highest food insecurity rate, 30.4%, in the country.

However, the pandemic disproportionately affected other states. For example, Nevada jumped from 20th to eighth highest food insecurity rate by state.

""Areas like Nevada, which has a strong emphasis on the service industry and tourism, will have substantially higher rates of increase in food insecurity than areas with fewer service sector workers,"" Gundersen says.

These findings can help direct relief efforts, he notes.

""Resources should continue to be directed towards those areas with greater needs before, during, and after COVID-19. But we also have to recognize that during the pandemic situation there are areas of the country, such as Nevada, which may need more emergency assistance in the near term,"" Gundersen says.

""Furthermore, some of these jobs may not come back; tourism may be permanently down in the United States. So these impacts could also have longer term ramifications,"" he concludes.","Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As Americans scattered to the privacy of their homes this week to avoid spreading the coronavirus, the opposite scene was playing out in the Mexican city of Monterrey.

A thousand or more young men arrived in the city, as they do most weeks of the year, filling up the cheap hotels, standing in long lines at the U.S. Consulate to pick up special H-2A visas for temporary agricultural workers, then gathering in a big park to board buses bound for farms in the United States.

""I spoke with people going to North Carolina, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi,"" says Justin Flores, vice president of the AFL-CIO's Farm Labor Organizing Committee, who was in Monterrey for meetings. ""[They were] headed to destinations all over the country to provide really important labor that supports the backbone of our economy, which is the agricultural industry.""

About 250,000 workers came to the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, the majority of them from Mexico. They've become an increasingly important piece of America's food industry.

Late in the day on Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City announced that it is suspending nonemergency visa appointments because of concerns for the health of its employees and visitors.

At the same time, though, the embassy notified farm employers that many — perhaps most — of these farm workers still can get their visas, because they participated in the program last year and don't require an in-person appointment at the consulate.

Ryan Ogburn, visa director at wafla, which helps farms manage the flow of H-2A workers in the Pacific Northwest, says that 85-90% of their workers will qualify for this exemption. Meanwhile, influential farm organizations in the U.S. are pushing the Trump administration to ease the entry of more guest workers.

The continuing availability of agricultural workers illustrates the paradox of America's food supply in the age of COVID-19.

One end of the food supply chain has been completely upended as restaurants go dark and consumers prowl half-empty aisles of supermarkets. Food producers, though, are operating almost as normal — at least for now.

Slaughterhouses, dairies and vegetable producers say that they are open for business, ready to feed the nation. Howard Roth, president of the National Pork Producers Council, wrote in a statement that ""telecommuting is not an option for us; we are reporting for work as always.""

Food distributors and wholesalers in the middle of that supply chain, meanwhile, are trying to perform logistical miracles, redirecting truckloads of food from shuttered businesses toward places where people now crave it — mainly grocery stores.

""There's nothing 'as usual' anymore,"" says Mark Levin, CEO of M. Levin and Co., a fruit and vegetable wholesaler in Philadelphia. Levin normally sells lots of bananas to schools and restaurants, and ""unfortunately, all those people, last minute, say, 'I'm sorry, I can't use this fruit. You must take it back, or don't deliver it.' And that's tough, because we've already got it in the system ripening and ready to sell,"" Levin says.

Can he send those bananas instead to grocery stores that are out of stock? ""Yes, but at a reduced price,"" Levin says.

The problem, Levin says, is that different customers want slightly different things. Schools and other institutions buy boxes of loose ""petite"" bananas, with 150 bananas in a box. ""Grocery stores don't want those,"" he says.

At least people are still eating. Drinking is a different story.

""We're losing a lot of occasions, regular things like birthday parties or weddings, where people normally get together,"" says Stephen Rannekleiv, who follows the beverage sector for RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness.

""For the beverage world, those are occasions for consumption. We're losing some of those,"" Rannekleiv says. He notes that in China, overall demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen by about 10% during the coronavirus crisis.

There's an even bigger worry hanging over the food industry: The prospect of workers testing positive for COVID-19.

When it happens, the response likely will go beyond sending that individual home — although that alone can be catastrophic to field workers who are paid, in part, based on their production. This week, the United Farm Workers union called on employers to expand paid sick leave for workers.

Vegetable growers are considering policies that would require quarantine for everyone who worked in close proximity to the infected person. That could easily include two dozen or more people. Workers on H-2A visas often live together, sharing kitchens and bedrooms and traveling together on buses. The virus could spread quickly, and measures to stop it will be extremely costly.

According to Steve Alameda, a vegetable grower in Yuma, Ariz., losing an entire 30-person work crew overnight will be extremely disruptive. Farmworkers already are hard to find, and replacing so many people immediately could prove impossible.

""We've got enough disruption,"" Alameda says. ""We don't need to disrupt our food supply, that would be really catastrophic.""","About 250,000 workers came to the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, the majority of them from Mexico.

During World War II, approximately 40% of recruits couldn’t enlist due to poor nutrition. Today, over 70% of would-be recruits are ineligible for a number of contributing factors, including nutrition and obesity. It’s become a matter of national security, according to an organization of retired generals.

""Seventy years ago, a military leader said a lack of nutritional food in our children and young adults contributed to military readiness,"" said retired Army Maj. Gen. Larry Harrington. ""We've made some improvements but we have a long, long way to go.""

Mission: Readiness is a national group made up of over 75 retired admirals and general across the country that focuses on helping children stay in school, in shape and out of trouble. The organization issued a report Wednesday, Improving Childhood Nutrition in Mississippi, that highlighted the need for federally funded programs that give children access to fresh and healthy food.

Wednesday morning, three generals from Mission: Readiness met with agencies from across Mississippi in a roundtable discussion in Jackson about child nutrition.

Nationally, 72% of those 17 to 24 years old are not able to qualify for the military due to lack of education, criminal background, substance abuse or medical disqualifiers. Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility in the nation, with 76% of eligible 17- to 24- year-olds not being able to qualify, said retired Army Brig. Gen. Roger Shields.

Obesity is one of the leading disqualifiers, he said. Twenty-five percent of 10- to 17- year-olds were obese in the state in 2018, while 40% of adults were obese.

""We believe that America must prioritize efforts to combat childhood obesity as a matter of national security,"" Shields said in a written statement released after the roundtable. ""Improving access to fresh and nutritious foods for all children will help reduce childhood obesity and ultimately ensure that the military has a pool of recruits.""

There is a ""network"" of federal nutrition programs available across Mississippi working to combat the issue but many don't know what is available to them, said retired Army Maj. Gen. Augustus Collins, a former adjutant general of Mississippi.

Collins cited the National School Lunch Program, Summer Food Service Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

According to the Mission: Readiness report, in 1945, Gen. Lewis Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, testified in front of Congress that at least 40% of recruits were rejected during World War II for reasons released to poor nutrition.

The National School Lunch program was founded the following year ""to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals,"" Collins said.

Recalling Hershey's testimony, Collins said, ""The lack of nutritious food for our children is actually a threat to national security.""

""It was back in World War II and it is today,"" he said.

Statistics: Nutrition, obesity and the military

In Mississippi, 76% of youth between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot serve in the military due to issues such as lack of education, a record of crime or substance abuse, or medical disqualifiers; higher than the national average of 71%.

Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility among all 50 states.

Obesity is one of the main medical disqualifiers. Individuals who would otherwise be eligible to serve in the military are being disqualified due to excess weight.

In Mississippi, nearly 40% of adults and 25% of children ages 10-17 were obese in 2018, the highest in the nation. In some counties, the percentage increases to 45.

Mississippi has the second highest rate of child food insecurity in the country. In 2016, over 24% of Mississippi children experienced food insecurity. The national average is 18 percent.

Between 2015 and 2017, over 17% of all households in Mississippi experienced food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at a higher rate for obesity.

Mississippi has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country at 17%.

In Mississippi, 37,000 participants, or 7% of National School Lunch Program participants, accessed the Summer Food Service Program, meaning a large majority of students may not have access to healthy food during the summer break.

Read Stateline coverage of the latest state action on coronavirus.

Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify the California Department of Food and Agriculture's role in the Farm to Family program.

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a longstanding initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and supported by the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

“All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,” said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. “When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.”

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts Quick View Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts A U.S.-China trade deal is falling short on its commitments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don’t have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic’s early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

“If food banks can’t take more product [from the California program], farmers are going to go out of business,” Linkhart said. “That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.”

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

“That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,” said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. “It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.”

Raudabaugh said the state’s dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers’ distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don’t make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

“We’re providing many hundreds of percents more [to food banks] than pre-pandemic,” Raudabaugh said. “Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these [partnerships]. It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.”

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

“The money has to be there to justify the harvest,” Michael said, “and this solves some of that problem.”

Washington’s Work

On Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen’s small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers’ pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

“It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,” Van Laanen said. “It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.”

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he’s already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi’s Farm stay afloat.

“It was really timely,” Chichester said. “It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early timeframe.”

Karen Affeld, the development group’s executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

“Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,” she said. “That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.”

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state’s Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California’s that launched in 2014.

It’s a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they’re harvesting crops bound for food banks.

“Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,” said David Bobanick, the group’s executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another four pounds are donated by farmers.

“Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,” he said. “It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.”

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

“Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,” said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets’ food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she’s heard from parents who couldn’t otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

Making Connections

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture — known as CSA — in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program’s website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

“You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,” said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. “People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.”

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

“We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,” Lebeaux said. “Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.”

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

“We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,” said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. “One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.”

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

“If there’s one silver lining,” she said, “it’s that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.”","And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State University will lead a new $15 million U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiative that continues efforts to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for global populations dependent on aquaculture-led economies.

USAID funding over five years will create the Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish, which MSU will lead through the university’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security under the direction of Mark Lawrence, associate dean and professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

MSU President Mark E. Keenum called the new USAID partnership “groundbreaking” and said the university is “well-positioned to lead this important effort.”

“Our relationship with USAID is a long and fruitful one that underscores Mississippi State’s position as a leading agricultural research university,” said Keenum. “It also speaks specifically to the quality of research and scholarship in our College of Veterinary Medicine.”

U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper provided leadership to help MSU secure the grant.

“I look forward to seeing the results of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish at Mississippi State University, which will help USAID reduce hunger and poverty around the world,” Wicker said. “As the national leader in aquaculture and fisheries research, the university and our state are uniquely suited to host this project. All Mississippians should take pride in the establishment of this innovation lab.”

The Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish is an interdisciplinary program aimed at reducing poverty and improving nutrition, food security and livelihoods among stakeholders in targeted regions. The lab is not a specific site, but a mechanism through which academic, private and public partners can identify solutions for global challenges.

Known as the Fish Innovation Lab, the project will implement integrated aquaculture and fisheries programs in developing countries. Fish are rich in critical micronutrients and are among the most traded agricultural commodities in the world, but more research is needed on ways developing countries can maximize this global resource for the health and economic growth of their populations. The Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish will conduct research focusing on improved production, reducing and mitigating risk to fish production systems and improving human outcomes.

“Being successful in the competition to lead the USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish is reflective of the many years faculty from several MSU colleges have worked on fish health and production issues,” said Kent Hoblet, Dean of MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “I look forward to seeing the impact that MSU and our College of Veterinary Medicine will have on reducing hunger and improving lives in the developing countries where the program will take us.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, who holds an MSU doctoral degree in agricultural economics and who served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has made global food security a university research priority during his tenure at MSU.

The initial focus for project activities will be on regions deemed priority areas for aquaculture and fisheries development by the Feed the Future and USAID: West Africa, East Africa, and Asia. Initial work will take place at the local level to develop best practices that can be scaled to national and regional levels.

“The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish is an important part of MSU’s overall strategy to provide leadership in providing solutions for global food security and livelihoods in priority countries,” Lawrence said. “The College of Veterinary Medicine is proud to contribute expertise to help lead this program.”

The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish utilizes a “Leader with Associates” model, through which MSU will facilitate associate awards to research and development partners. As the lead and management entity, MSU will identify and manage a portfolio of investments for research and development activities that address both promising innovations and emerging challenges in aquaculture and fisheries through an integrated approach of blending multiple disciplines.

As a platform for innovation, the project will connect the expertise and capacity of a consortium of public and private organizations, government research agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs,) domestic and international universities, as well as small farm associations within the target countries.

MSU is recognized as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health by the World Food Programme and the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. The university’s Global Center for Aquatic Food Security works to addresses challenges facing aquaculture and find solutions to meeting the world’s food security needs while ensuring a safe supply of seafood.

MSU is Mississippi’s leading university, available online at www.msstate.edu.

45,45,"Dec 21, 2019",NPR,New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion,"New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Danny Moloshok/AP Danny Moloshok/AP

Some low-income college students are among the 688,000 food stamp recipients projected to lose benefits as a result of a Trump administration rule announced Dec. 4. While the rule explicitly targets ""able-bodied adults without dependents,"" it also limits food assistance for a share of college students at a time when campuses across the country are grappling with how to respond to food insecurity.

The new rule makes it harder for states to waive the requirement that adults work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — benefits. Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.

""As long as a student is at least half-time, they are not considered an [able-bodied adult without dependents] subject to SNAP work requirements, so that new rule would not impact them,"" says Kathryn Larin, director of the Education Workforce and Income Security Team at the Government Accountability Office. ""The group that it would impact would be students enrolled less than half-time.""

Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

This is because Congress created the program with the image of a ""traditional"" student in mind: someone entering college directly from high school, financially reliant on their parents, with no income or dependents.

But this archetype is far from universal, says Parker Gilkesson, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy who specializes in income and work supports. Only about 1 in 4 students attend a four-year institution immediately after high school.

Many college students are older or are parents themselves. And few have a financial safety net: Countless families are spending all they have just to send their children to college, let alone pay for their food and other necessities, she says.

""[Congress] did recognize there are circumstances where students could and should be eligible for SNAP, and so they set up a number of exceptions from this prohibition against college students getting SNAP,"" Larin said. ""What are those exemptions, who is eligible for them, how do you meet those exemptions? That's where the confusion comes in.""

In order for college students to be eligible for SNAP, they must first meet income and asset limits, household qualifications and immigration status requirements. Those who are enrolled less than half of the time — as defined by their school — can then qualify under standard SNAP rules.

Students enrolled more than half of the time may qualify for SNAP by meeting one of a number of criteria, which include being responsible for a dependent child younger than 6, working at least 20 hours a week in paid employment, receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, participating in an on-the-job training program, being outside the 18-49 age range, and being unable to work for health reasons.

""No matter if they're full time, part time, half time, even taking one class, [students] are taking the initiative to really better themselves and grow and further their academic career,"" Gilkesson says. ""They shouldn't be punished for not being able to find steady employment in the economy that we are in today.""

Gilkesson says it is unclear exactly how many students will lose benefits as a result of the new rule, particularly because able-bodied adults without dependents are not necessarily also classified as students if they are enrolled part time. But she adds it is clear that the rule will disproportionately impact young people, people of color and those who struggle to find employment, leaving them without much-needed food assistance.

""Most people who receive SNAP who can work, do work,"" she says. ""But there are a lot of jobs and specifically low-wage jobs out here that have volatile schedules ... people can be let go at any time, so we shouldn't allow people to go hungry just based on their ability to maintain work.""

According to National Center for Education Statistics data on unduplicated year-round enrollment, 5.8 million students were enrolled in public two-year colleges in fall 2017. About 2.1 million were full time, and 3.7 million were part time. Gilkesson says that while there are more students enrolled part time in community colleges than in four-year institutions, food insecurity exists on all types of campuses.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat. This was among the findings of a 2018 Government Accountability Office report that also said almost 2 million at-risk students who were potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits in 2016.

Only 4 in 10 students who are potentially eligible for SNAP are actually enrolled in the program, according to Gilkesson. This is due to perceived stigma as well as confusion about who can apply for SNAP and how to do so.

""The information that's available from the USDA ... is difficult to find on their website and also hard to understand, it's very legal language,"" says Larin, adding that people whose jobs it is to connect college students with these resources may struggle to understand the criteria. Advocates worry that the new rule will exacerbate this confusion.

The GAO report released last December made two recommendations: that the Food and Nutrition Service (which is part of U.S. Department of Agriculture) improve the information on its website to make it easier to find and understand, and that it take a more active role in sharing states' best practices for connecting students to SNAP. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations but has not yet implemented them as of mid-December 2019.

Gilkesson received SNAP in college and was a SNAP worker at a county agency in North Carolina prior to her current job. She says it was not until she saw the other side of the ""intricate"" process that she realized how much information she never received as a student, both because she didn't know what to tell workers and because they didn't always know what to ask.

As a SNAP worker, she saw the impact that fresh food and hot meals had on clients' lives.

""You need food to live, you need food to work, you need food to thrive,"" Gilkesson says. ""And hunger does not make people more employable either.""

In fact, she adds, hunger makes it harder for people to find well-paying jobs that align with their skills and often leads to cycles of being laid off, having to find a new job quickly and missing out on the opportunity to gain the education, training and skills necessary for more meaningful and sustainable employment.

She says research shows that SNAP encourages work and that the idea that people experiencing poverty don't want to get jobs is ""implicit bias.""

The Trump administration says the new rule is intended to promote SNAP recipients entering the workforce. Critics have slammed the change for eliminating food assistance for nearly 700,000 people, many of whom already struggle to find work.

Gilkesson says it is concerning that college students will lose benefits, but the prevalence of food insecurity should be an issue regardless of who is experiencing it.

""No one should be hungry,"" she says. ""That's a basic necessity. And when we start to think about it in that way, we really will start to see the policy change that we need to see.""

46,46,"Dec 21, 2020",CNBC,Lawmakers allocate $13 billion to food assistance programs in an effort to alleviate hunger crisis,"Lawmakers agreed to a $900 billion coronavirus relief package on Sunday, which includes $13 billion in funding to support food assistance programs, at a time when demand and lines at food pantries around the country are reaching record levels.

About 13% of Americans, or 27.4 million people, reported they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat on a weekly basis, according to the latest Household Pulse Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 16. About 14 million households with children report not having enough to eat.

It's a situation lawmakers hope to improve. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a hunger crisis that has touched every part of our nation,"" Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry said in a statement Sunday. ""I am relieved that help is on the way and I look forward to continuing to do more in the new year to help Americans through this continuing crisis.""

Sunday's funding deal includes a 15% increase to the maximum SNAP benefits for six months through June 30, 2021, a move that many advocates were calling for. The increase amounts to a boost of about $25 per person each month.

The average SNAP benefit per person was $125 per month during the fiscal year 2020, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's about $1.39 per person per meal.

Roughly 6 to 7 million more people have applied and been approved for SNAP benefits since February, according to available data analyzed by CBPP. Nationally, that's about a 17% increase. About 25.3 million Americans total reported currently receiving SNAP benefits in the latest Census Household Pulse survey.

The latest relief package also expands SNAP eligibility to college students and excludes unemployment benefits from being counted as income when it comes to SNAP benefits. Additionally, U.S. territories including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa — which are not eligible for SNAP — will receive $614 million for nutrition grants.

The bill will also expand food access for children, including allowing any child under 6 to be deemed ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits under the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program. The program provides families with a voucher to purchase groceries to replace the breakfasts and lunches their children miss when schools and child-care centers are closed or only offering remote learning.

Congress reauthorized the program on Oct. 1, but it took the U.S. Department of Agriculture six weeks to establish the new guidelines for the program, meaning that states only started applying for funds this month.

Under the latest bipartisan deal, food banks also will receive $400 million in funding through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, will receive $175 million.

""Our network of member food banks across the country are witnessing unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for charitable food assistance,"" Kate Leone, Feeding America's chief government relations officer, said in a statement last week. ""Families are making impossible decisions between paying the rent and putting food on the table while food banks are working tirelessly to keep up with the increased need.""

The $13 billion in funding would provide ""limited but immediate help,"" Leone said, adding that more federal funding and assistance would likely be needed in the future. ""As always, and especially during this crisis, the simple truth is that charity alone cannot solve food insecurity.""

47,47,"Nov 19, 2020",U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Newsroom,ICE executes federal search warrants at multiple Mississippi locations,"JACKSON, Miss. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) executed multiple federal criminal search warrants at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi Wednesday morning as part of an ongoing HSI worksite enforcement criminal investigation.

In addition to executing federal search warrants and seizing business records pertaining to the ongoing federal criminal investigation, deportation officers with ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in partnership with HSI detained approximately 680 removable aliens who were unlawfully working at the plants.

All the unlawfully present foreign nationals arrested Wednesday are being interviewed by ICE staff to record any potential mitigating humanitarian situations. Based on these interviews, and consideration of their criminality and prior immigration history, ICE is determining on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the circumstances which individuals will be detained and which persons may be released from custody at present. In all cases, all the illegal aliens encountered as part of this operation are either being placed into removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts, and for those who already received due process and have been ordered removed, processed for removal from the U.S.

A 24-hour toll-free hotline is available for family members of those arrested in this operation to address questions about their detention location and status, and the removal process. This hotline operates in English and Spanish; the phone number is 1-855-479-0502.

This HSI-led operation was conducted in coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi, of which U.S. Attorney D. Michael Hurst Jr. will prosecute any resulting federal criminal charges.

HSI is the federal law enforcement agency responsible for upholding the laws established by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which requires employers to verify the identity and work eligibility of individuals they hire. These laws help protect jobs for U.S. citizens and lawful U.S. residents, eliminate unfair competitive advantages for companies that unlawfully hire an illegal workforce, and strengthen public safety and national security.

Unauthorized workers often use stolen identities of legal U.S. workers, which can profoundly damage for years the identity-theft victim’s credit, medical records and other aspects of their everyday life.

HSI’s worksite enforcement investigators help combat worker exploitation, illegal wages, child labor and other illegal practices. Worksite enforcement investigations often involve additional criminal activity, such as alien smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering, document fraud, worker exploitation and/or substandard wage and working conditions.

In addition to worksite enforcement operations like this one, HSI also uses I-9 audits to create a culture of compliance among employers.

48,48,"Nov 5, 2020",BetaBoston,Study: A million people in Mass. don’t have enough food,"Massachusetts has seen the highest percent increase of residents facing food insecurity of all states, according to new projections released by Feeding America last Friday. The hunger rate in the state has increased 59 percent since 2018, representing more than 1 million people who are now struggling to get enough to eat. The child food-insecurity rate has also worsened, with one in five children in Massachusetts now living in food-insecure households, a 102 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 levels. (Norfolk County in Massachusetts has the highest percent change in child food-insecurity in the country, with a 163 percent increase in 2020 versus 2018.)

As the country awaits the returns of the presidential election and any prospects of another economic stimulus bill, one thing has remained consistent amid the pandemic: People in Massachusetts are going hungry. And the problem is only growing.

The overall food insecurity rate in Massachusetts is projected to reach 14.2 percent this year. The highest rates in the United States will be in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, which could each have more than 20 percent of their citizens facing hunger. And California is predicted to have 6.2 million people who are having trouble getting enough to eat, the largest total number of any state in the country.

“The need isn’t going anywhere,” said Catherine Drennan, the director of public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, which served over 600,000 people in September, a 120 percent increase over last year.

November and December are typically some of the busiest months for local food banks, but the combined economic, political, and public health crises facing the Commonwealth will make this year unlike any other, said Drennan. She said the food bank is planning to provide 20 million meals as part of its annual Hunger Free Holidays campaign.

New issues with a federal food-distribution program have stoked anxieties further among local organizations working to provide food to those in need. Back in May, as part of the CARES Act, the USDA launched its $4.5 billion Farmers to Families Food Box program, working with US farmers to purchase and distribute boxes of agricultural products. During the first three rounds of the program, several vendors in New England were awarded eight-week contracts, and each built a network of local distributors to hand out hundreds of thousands of prepacked boxes filled with dairy, meat, and produce.

Many of the boxes ended up being distributed to local nonprofits — like the Brazilian Workers Center in Allston — which are operating outside the established regional food bank networks, having launched or expanded emergency food services as they saw the need in their communities.

“Since COVID-19, we’ve had to repurpose our regular services to meet food insecurity in the community,” said the Brazilian Workers Center’s executive director, Natalicia Tracy. “The Boston food banks weren’t equipped to handle the demand, and we saw a huge increase in need for food in Allston. So the USDA boxes were really critical.” The Brazilian Workers Center now feeds 500 families each week.

But the execution of the food box program has been fraught. Farmers who won contracts and planted crops for the program were left high and dry when they weren’t chosen as vendors in subsequent rounds. In some parts of the country, there were concerns about the nutritional value of the goods included in the boxes. The USDA also faced blowback last month after President Trump required that a signed letter from him be included in each box.

In the agency’s latest funding round announced last Friday, no Massachusetts vendors were awarded contracts. This will likely mean significant delays in getting the next round of local food distributions up and running, leaving partner organizations like Tracy’s scrambling to find sources for food as they head toward Thanksgiving. So earlier this week, she headed back to the store. “We’ve already purchased 1,200 pounds of rice, beans, and pasta, and some produce. We’re still trying to figure out whatever we can get our hands on,” she said.

Those who have been working with the USDA say that the changes will put undue pressure on the Massachusetts food bank system during its busiest season.

“In two weeks these pantries are going to burn through whatever dry goods they have in back stock,"" said Sean Buchanan, the vice president of sales at Costa Fruit and Produce, one of the local distributors whose vendor contract with the USDA was not renewed. He said Costa handed out more than 889,000 food boxes to 400 partners since the program launched, only to have to turn off the faucet for the distributions on Monday.

“It’s a perfect storm for food insecurity,"" he said.

The USDA’s decision also forced produce distributor Katsiroubas Bros. to lay off 40 staff members overnight, said Torry Katsiroubas Stamm, the company’s president. Over the past several months, the Boston-based distributor had set up an elaborate supply chain and partnered with the nonprofit Boston Area Gleaners to deliver more than 10 million pounds of food to nonprofits, public housing sites, and food banks throughout New England, she said. The program has helped keep her business afloat as her restaurant and food service accounts have cut back on orders amid the pandemic.

Now, that supply chain has been upended, and a new company in Long Island, N.Y., has been given the contract and has to start over creating a distribution plan from scratch, she said.

“Our partners have been calling us, and we don’t have anything to tell them,” Katsiroubas said. “They’re panicked."" She said she feels the same level of stress she heard from her customers back in March, “with everyone saying ‘What do we do?' We’re still here, it feels like it’s happening again.”

“Before this program got up and running, we saw a lot of nonprofits that had never moved food or dealt with food moving thousands of boxes or grocery bags a week,” said Dylan Frazier, the director of strategy for the Boston Area Gleaners, which worked as both a vendor and partner with local distributors to make USDA food box deliveries. “We’re telling people you have to call the food bank, we don’t have any food for you,” he said. “People are flipping out. It’s panic mode. There’s still a line of a thousand or two thousand people with no food.”

Food pantry lines have already been getting longer over the past several months at the Salvation Army of Chelsea and East Boston, said Captain Isael Gonzalez, who oversees the emergency food program there. So, having to wait for the USDA program to restart with new vendors from out of state means he’s now struggling to serve the 700 families that seek out his services daily.

“Through the USDA program, we’ve been distributing over 2,100 boxes each week to families out of our office, and the good part is the boxes come prepacked, and there’s no labor on our end,” Gonzales said. “Not having those boxes is going to have a huge impact: It’s more trips to the Greater Boston Food Bank, more relying on local donations from different resources, and a lot of labor intensity on our part too.”

Ultimately, the USDA Food Box program provides just a small percentage of the overall food assistance currently in place in the region. But “we’ll take every food source we can and it’s definitely helpful,” Drennan, of the Greater Boston Food Bank, said. More importantly, she added, the program is set to expire by year’s end, and “unless another stimulus package comes out and they decide to renew, I don’t know what will happen.”

(CNN) —

Someone gained access to the Ring security camera of a Mississippi family and used the speaker feature to harass their 8-year-old daughter, telling her he was Santa Claus and encouraging her to destroy the room.

The horrifying ordeal is one of several recent incidents in which hackers have figure out a way to log into Ring accounts without the user’s knowledge.

Ashley LeMay told CNN affiliate WMC she installed the camera in her daughters’ room so she could watch over them while she works overnight nursing shifts. “I did a lot of research on these before I got them. You know, I really felt like it was safe,” she told the affiliate.

The intrusion happened just four days after she installed it when she was running an errand and her husband was at home with the kids.

When her daughter Alyssa heard noises coming from her bedroom, the child went in to see what it was.

The Ring camera footage, obtained by WMC, shows Alyssa standing nervously in her room while Tiny Tim’s rendition of “Tiptoe through the Tulips,” a warbling song featured in the horror movie “Insidious,” plays over the camera’s speaker.

“Who is that,” Alyssa asks, after a man’s voice fills her room.

“I’m your best friend. I’m Santa Claus,” the voice says. “I’m Santa Claus. Don’t you want to be my best friend?”

WMC reported the unidentified person continued to harass the girl, taunting her and encouraging her to destroy her room.

“I watched the video and I mean my heart just like … I didn’t even get to the end where she is screaming ‘Mommy, mommy’ before I like ran inside,” LeMay said.

Ring responds

In a statement sent to CNN, Ring said the hacker did not gain access through a data breach or compromise of Ring’s security. Instead, the person likely took advantage of the family’s weak account security.

“Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously,” the statement said. “We have investigated this incident and can confirm it is in no way related to a breach or compromise of Ring’s security.”

According to the statement, Ring users “often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions.” If those were to fall into the wrong hands, those devices could be compromised.

“As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords, and regularly change their passwords,” the statement said.

Ashley told WMC she had not set up two-factor authentication on her device.

Others have been hacked and harassed

There were at least three other instances in the past week alone involving Ring devices.

On Wednesday morning, a father in Nebraska was shocked to hear a voice talking to his daughter through the Ring camera on their kitchen counter. He told CNN affiliate WOWT that he immediately unplugged the device and called Ring, who told him a third-party device had logged into his account.

Earlier this week, an Atlanta woman was in her bed when a man’s voice came over her bedroom Ring camera, yelling that he could see her and demanding that she wake up, CNN affiliate WSB-TV reported.

On Sunday night in Florida, a Cape Coral couple was harassed by a person over their Ring camera who made racist comments about their biracial family, revealing that he had likely been watching them for days.

On each of these occasions, Ring said the system invasion was not the result of a breach or failure of Ring’s security. Instead, the hacker had likely gained access to the family’s account through weak or stolen login credentials.

How to avoid being a victim

Most customers, called “neighbors” by Ring, buy the cameras hoping to get the peace of mind and protection the company advertises.

Steps can be taken to protect your personal data and make it more difficult for unknown people to gain access to your accounts.

Practicing good security habits with strong and unique passwords is the first step towards strengthening your account security.

Change default password immediately and avoid using phrases or dates that are significant to you, like birthdays or relatives’ names.

Remembering multiple passwords is difficult, but password managers like 1Password or LastPass can help you keep your passwords secure but on hand for when you need to use them.

Two-factor or two-step authentication, like Ring encourages its users to set up, adds an additional layer of security on your accounts.

Two-step authentication involves a user entering a password followed by a prompt to either enter a code sent via text or email, swipe a fingerprint or provide another way to prove their identity.

50,50,"Oct 2, 2020",Wiley,Food Insecurity during COVID‐19,"For a decade, Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG) has provided sub‐state‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children. Along with being extensively used by food banks, it is widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. In this paper, we describe the methods underpinning MMG, detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020, and how food insecurity rates may have changed due to COVID‐19 since 2018. We project an increase of 17 million Americans who are food insecure in 2020 but this aggregate increase masks substantial geographic variation found in MMG.

Introduction This year represents the tenth anniversary of Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG). On an annual basis, MMG provides county‐ and congressional district‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children and, upon request, subcounty‐level results at, for example, the zip code level. Along with being extensively used by food banks to direct scarce resources to those most in need, it is now widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. For MMG, food insecurity rates are calculated with an imputation method that uses information from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Since the Core Food Security Module (CSFM) is in the December CPS and the resulting data is not publicly released until September of the following year and the ACS is not released until December, this has meant that MMG, released in the spring, is based on data that is roughly eighteen months old. Given that post‐Great Recession, rates have remained relatively stable from year to year, as have geographical differences within and across states, this release schedule has not produced issues regarding timeliness. Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018. In this article, after describing the methods underpinning MMG, we detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020 and how this may differ from 2018. Central to these projections is that the methods used in MMG allow for us to do this when information about predictions of the underlying variables are available. We then turn to a description of multiple aspects of this changed geography of food insecurity.

Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children). Examples of survey questions include: Did you or the other adults in your household ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?. Were you ever hungry but did not eat because you could not afford enough food? and Did a child in the household ever not eat for a full day because you could not afford enough food? (the most severe question). (For the complete set of questions, see Coleman‐Jensen et al. 2019.) The responses for some of these questions are yes or no. In other cases, respondents are asked if something happened never, sometimes, or often. A response of sometimes or often is counted as an affirmative response. Other questions ask respondents if something happened almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only one or two months. A response of almost every month or some months but not every month is counted as an affirmative response. Based on these responses, households are delineated into three categories: A household is said to be food secure if they respond affirmatively to two or fewer questions; low food secure if they respond affirmatively to three to seven questions (three to five questions for households without children); and very low food secure if they respond affirmatively to eight or more questions (six or more questions for households without children). Food insecure households are those without access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household. The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity. Methods We proceed in two steps to estimate the extent of food insecurity in each county (congressional district). Step 1 FI st = α + β UN UN st + β POV POV st + β MI MI st + β HISP HISP st + β BLACK BLACK st + β own OWN st + β DSBL DSBL st + μ t + υ s + ε st (1) where s is a state, t is year, UN is the unemployment rate, POV is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate, MI is median income, HISP is the percentage of Hispanics, BLACK is the percentage of African Americans, OWN is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners, DSBL is the percentage of individuals who report a disability, μ t is a year fixed effect, υ s is a state fixed effect, and ε st is an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Using state‐level data from 2009 to 2018, we estimate a model where the food insecurity rate for individuals at the state level is determined by the following equation:whereis a state,is year,is the unemployment rate,is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate,is median income,is the percentage of Hispanics,is the percentage of African Americans,is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners,is the percentage of individuals who report a disability,is a year fixed effect,is a state fixed effect, andis an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Our choice of variables was first guided by the literature on the determinants of food insecurity. We included variables that have been found in prior research to influence the probability of a household being food insecure. (For an overview of that literature in this context see Gundersen and Ziliak 2018.) While the food insecurity measure is defined at the household level, we assume all members of a food‐insecure household are food insecure, consistent with the approach found in, e.g., table 1 of Coleman‐Jensen et al. (2019). Next, we chose variables that are available both in the CPS and the ACS. Table 1.

The variables POV, MI, HISP, BLACK, OWN, and DISBL are based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures and UN is based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. We use the coefficient estimates from Step 1 plus information on the same variables defined at the county level to generate estimated food‐insecurity rates for individuals defined at the county level. This can be expressed in the following equation:wheredenotes a county. The variables, andare based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures andis based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. This year for MMG we made two primary changes. First, we added the percent of the population that has a disability to reflect the profound impact that disability status has on food insecurity. (See, e.g., Balistreri 2019; Brucker and Coleman‐Jensen 2017; Noonan, Corman, and Reichman 2016; Sonik et al. 2016.) Second, the poverty variable now only includes nonundergraduate students. This is because the true resources available to undergraduates are, on average, not reflected in the poverty rate. Consistent with this are the much lower food insecurity rates among college students in comparison to noncollege students of similar ages (Gundersen 2021). The above methods allow us to establish a base measure of food insecurity for all counties for the full population and for children. Using this base measure, we establish what we believe will happen to food insecurity in the US in 2020 because of the COVID‐19 pandemic. To do so, we consider what will occur if two of the variables in the model above, the unemployment rate and the poverty rate, increase along the lines predicted by expert opinions. (The other variables in our model are unlikely to change due to COVID‐19.) In our most recent estimates of the upper‐bound impact (as of July 13, 2020), we have assumed that the annual average unemployment rate will increase to 11.5% (up 7.6% compared to 2018) and the poverty rate will increase to 16.6% (up 4.8% compared to 2018). When we wrote the first version of this paper, there had not been expert projections of changes in poverty rates due to COVID‐19, so we assumed that the proportional change in the poverty rate viz. the unemployment rate would be roughly the same as during the Great Recession. To put this into terms of equation (2), we assume the value of UN C will increase (on average) by 0.076 and the value of POV c will increase by 0.048. This increase in the unemployment rate, though, is unlikely to be uniform across all counties in the US Instead, certain industries and occupations will be disproportionately affected by COVID‐19. So, we further adjust the county‐level and CD‐level unemployment projections for the proportion of the population that is likely to lose their jobs, combining data from the American Community Survey with estimates established in Hatzius et al. (2020).

Findings At the national level, we project 54 million food insecure Americans in 2020, approximately 17 million higher than in 2018. For children, the food insecurity rates are projected to increase to 18 million, up nearly 7 million from 2018. These national estimates, though, mask substantial heterogeneity across the country in terms of the projected impacts of COVID‐19. This is not unexpected, given the geographic diversity in the base models for both the full population (figure 1) and children (figure 2). Looking at states, the highest five states are the same whether or not COVID‐19 occurred—Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. However, there are some states that will see much higher food insecurity rates. Nevada stands out—pre‐COVID‐19 it would have been twentieth, but post‐COVID‐19 it is projected to be eighth. For children, Louisiana and New Mexico are first and second with or without COVID‐19, but Nevada is now third (ninth without COVID‐19). The substantially higher projected rates for Nevada are primarily due to their reliance on service sector jobs, which have been disproportionately affected by COVID‐19.

[Color figure can be viewed at [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com One of the key contributions from MMG is its portrayal of the substantial heterogeneity in local food insecurity that is seen in figures 1 and 2. The responses to COVID‐19 will also vary based on geography, although, consistent with the state results, there is likely to be some similarities in terms of county rankings. For the full population (table 1), we display, first, the fifteen counties with the highest rates of food insecurity in the base case and due to our projections. In the base case, the fifteen counties are all in the South or counties with Indian Reservations. The highest is Jefferson County, Mississippi (30.4%) and the fifteenth is Harlan County, Kentucky (24.8%). Without the adjustments for county‐level differences in unemployment rates described above, these would be the same orderings after COVID‐19 but, due to these adjustments, there are some differences. The five highest remain the same but, for example, Washington County, Mississippi and Wolfe County, Kentucky are now in the top fifteen. In the final two column of table 1 we display the projected percent increases in food insecurity for the highest fifteen counties. These are all counties with base rates that are relatively low, which is the reason for the substantial increases. The increases range from 157.3% in the highest (Burke County, North Dakota) to 109.5% in the fifteenth highest (Daggett County, Utah). These dramatic increases may be one reason for why some food banks reported being especially strained in response to COVID‐19. Table 2 has the same structure as table 1 but for children. As expected, there is overlap in counties between the two. For example, Kusilvak Census Area in Alaska is second highest for children and fourth highest for the full population for both the base case and the rankings after COVID‐19. There are some contrasts, though, insofar as Texas has no counties in the top fifteen for the full population but has four in the base case for children and four in the COVID‐19 projections. In terms of projected percent increases for children, there are some differences with the full population. While North Dakota has ten of the fifteen highest counties for the full population, they have two for children and, conversely, Virginia has one in the full population but six for children including the top three. The range of the percent increase is also higher and wider—from 143.6% for the fifteenth (Kendall County, Illinois) to 363.0% to the highest (Falls Church City, Virginia). (An Excel file with the full set of results for the full population and children including the projected proportional changes and the adjustment for unemployment rate is in the Appendix.) Table 2.

Conclusion The proceeding discussion—and the full set of results with updates as needed at http://map.feedingamerica.org/—provides an overview of the geographic diversity in food insecurity rates across the U.S. and what may happen due to COVID‐19. We conclude with three main points. First, while these projections of increased food insecurity rates are of great concern, they would have been for worse were it not for the resiliency of the agricultural supply chain in the face of COVID‐19. (For more on this, see the other articles in this Special Issue.) Given that food prices are a key determinant of food insecurity (e.g., Gregory and Coleman‐Jensen 2013; Courtemanche et al. 2019), if there had been price increases due to agricultural supply chain breakdowns, the food insecurity rates we have estimated would have been much higher. In other words, the projected increase in food insecurity is due to projected increases in unemployment and poverty and not problems within the agricultural sector. Future researchers may wish to consider why this success occurred and, in particular, the protections it afforded vulnerable persons. Second, our estimates are based on information from annual food insecurity measures for the full calendar year instead of food insecurity measures that are based on either shorter time frames (e.g., the previous thirty days) and or across years. In addition, these estimates are based on the full set of eighteen questions on the CFSM. Three other papers in this Special Issue employ other methods to ascertain the impact of COVID‐19 on food insecurity and, as such, our results are not directly comparable. (See Ahn and Norwood 2021; Restrepo, Rabbitt, and Gregory 2021: and Ziliak 2021.) Third, the accuracy of our projections will not become evident until September 2021 for the national results and March 2022 for the MMG estimates. We look forward to ascertaining the success (or lack of success) of our projections at that time.

51,51,"Jan 11, 2021",The Conversation US,18 million US children are at risk of hunger: How is the problem being addressed and what more can be done?,"Editor’s note: The economic crisis brought about by the coronavirus pandemic has increased the number of Americans who can’t always get enough to eat, including children. The Conversation U.S. asked four experts to explain how common child hunger is and what’s being done to address it.

1. How big a problem is child hunger in the US?

Heather Eicher-Miller, associate professor of nutrition science at Purdue University: Hunger has two very different meanings. It can describe that uncomfortable feeling you get after not eating in a while. It’s also a long-term physical state.

People who experience long-term hunger aren’t just uncomfortable. They can feel weakness or pain and run an elevated risk of illnesses, including asthma, iron-deficiency anemia and poor bone health.

Hunger can of course arise when someone doesn’t eat enough, but it’s also a result of food insecurity – what happens when you lack the money or other means of accessing enough of the right kinds or amounts of food.

Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

David Himmelgreen, professor of anthropology at the University of South Florida: Food insecurity and child hunger have both skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were an estimated 50 million food-insecure Americans by the end of 2020, up sharply from 35 million in 2019, the last year for which official data is available.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, estimated in 2019 that there were 12.5 million U.S. children – 1 in 6 – at risk of hunger. With growth in the number of American workers unemployed and children living in poverty, a team of researchers determined in July 2020 that 18 million children – 1 in 4 – were experiencing food insecurity at least sometimes, a few months into the coronavirus pandemic.

Kecia Johnson, assistant professor of sociology at Mississippi State University: Children who experience hunger are more likely to be sick, to recuperate from illness more slowly and to be hospitalized more frequently.

Among other things, being food insecure increases the potential for obesity, heart disease and diabetes, including for children. And food-insecure children are at least twice as likely as other kids to have a variety of health problems, such as anemia, asthma and anxiety.

Food-insecure kids can also have more trouble at school than other children and become more likely to experience social isolation.

2. What’s being done about the problem?

Diana Cuy Castellanos, assistant professor of dietetics and nutrition at the University of Dayton: Some 15 federal programs assist Americans who need help getting enough nutritious food to eat. The programs cover different populations including the elderly, people with low incomes, infants and children, and Native American communities, as well as areas where there is need for emergency relief due to disasters.

The largest is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known more commonly as SNAP. It provides assistance for the purchase of food based on income and cost US$85.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Following the passage of a bipartisan relief package in December, most families of four can currently get $782 in monthly assistance through SNAP.

Many people still call these benefits “food stamps,” but now, instead of receiving vouchers to purchase food, people receive a card that looks like a credit card with their food allowance on it.

The government also runs the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides nutritional aid for low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women and women with at least one child age 5 or under. In addition, there are the School Breakfast and Lunch programs as well as the Summer Food Service Program, which funds free healthy meals and snacks to children and teens in low-income areas when school is not in session.

Many of these programs target specific segments of the population, such as children and the elderly. All have something in common: They are designed to help low-income families afford food so as to free up more of their limited income on other needs, such as housing and transportation.

Himmelgreen: While federal nutrition programs have helped reduce the severity of food insecurity and child hunger, only a limited number of Americans who don’t get enough to eat can take advantage of them. To get SNAP in Florida, for example, people may not have more than a total of either $2,001 or $3,001 – depending on their age and disabilities – in their savings and checking accounts. Other states have similar but different restrictions, making it hard to estimate the number of Americans who need help but can’t get it. Hence, millions more people than ever are relying on drive-through food pantries during the pandemic.

Johnson: There are some 60,000 food pantries, meal programs and food banks, according to Feeding America, serving about 40 million people yearly. Feeding America and its affiliated food banks and pantries also run food pantries in schools and backpack programs, which provide students with easily prepared foods, like boxed macaroni and cheese and canned beans, to take home, throughout the country.

For example, an elementary school in Holmes County, Mississippi, has supplied participating families with food and other supplies since 2019.

Eicher-Miller: Nutrition education is another way to address food insecurity and help reduce the number of children who go hungry. For example, the federal government offers nutrition education to individuals and families who receive SNAP benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education program, or SNAP-Ed. It provides comprehensive nutrition education regarding how to get the most nutrition per food dollar to many of the people who get SNAP benefits and may be having trouble serving their families healthy meals on a limited budget.

The government supports SNAP-Ed in locations like food pantries, community centers and food assistance offices. Its practical budgeting advice, cooking classes and nutrition information make families with children less likely to experience food insecurity, according to a study by my team. When people get the hang of buying the healthiest foods they can on a tight budget, their kids are less likely to go hungry.

I think of nutrition education as a gift that keeps giving in the sense that once someone has the knowledge they can keep using it to stay food secure into the future.

3. What are some of the more promising innovations?

Cuy Castellanos: Food insecurity is a complex problem for many reasons, including the limited access millions of people have to the fresh fruits and vegetables everyone should eat.

That’s why I’m excited to see people starting to grow their own food in low-income communities with few grocery stores or opportunities to buy produce, from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Nonprofits and families are growing food on their own property or are using vacant lots or land on school or church grounds.

Some groups such as Homefull and Mission of Mary Farms in Dayton, Ohio, have even begun to build greenhouses to extend the growing season and producing root vegetables and leafy greens as well as raising chickens.

Johnson: A new community garden is also making a difference in the small majority-Black town of Maben in rural Mississippi, where there’s nowhere to buy vegetables. Starting in 2019, local leaders approved the conversion of a former school athletic field into a community garden. Once volunteers from a farmers cooperative had cleared and plowed the field, other volunteers planted and harvested crops of tomatoes, purple hull peas, okra and watermelons. The gardeners distributed this first wave of produce primarily to elderly people in Maben who used to have family gardens and give away their own homegrown food in years past.

Himmelgreen: Many innovative programs across the country are aiming to reduce food insecurity and improve the health of low-income Americans.

At “client food choice” food pantries, clients don’t just pick up boxes of free, nutritious items. Instead, they get to choose the foods they want and get recipes and other kinds of nutrition education. There are also food prescription programs based in hospitals and medical clinics, where patients are screened for food insecurity and, if eligible, enrolled in SNAP and given help connecting with food pantries either on site or nearby.

A growing number of nonprofits also refer people to school-based food pantries, which operate in K-12 public schools and on college campuses and the meals-on-wheels programs that assist people who are homebound.

I believe these programs need to be scaled up or replicated whenever possible in areas where there is a high level of food insecurity and child hunger but a lack of nonprofit help available.","Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

52,52,"Dec 27, 2020",Magnolia State Live,Argument over cold food leads to shootout at Mississippi restaurant - Magnolia State Live,"An argument over cold food heated things leading to a shootout at a Mississippi Waffle House early Saturday morning.

Just after 2 a.m., Vicksburg police officers responded to a call where two women were causing a disturbance over the temperature of their food. The women were told to leave and then escorted out of the restaurant by a security guard.

Once outside, the women reportedly attempted to assault the security guard and sprayed him with pepper spray. It was also at this time that an unknown male shot three times in the direction of the security guard.

(CNN) —

US immigration authorities have detained some 680 undocumented immigrants in what a federal prosecutor described as a record-setting operation.

US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Mike Hurst told reporters the arrests took place at seven sites in six different cities in Mississippi on Wednesday. The raids, he said, are “believed to be the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in our nation’s history.”

Officials declined to provide details about what sites had been targeted, citing what they said was an ongoing criminal investigation. CNN affiliates reported the raids at food-processing plants throughout the state.

The arrests came as a result of administrative and criminal search warrants executed by special agents from Homeland Security Investigations, Hurst said.

“Today, through the hard work of these men and women, we are once again becoming a nation of laws,” he said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has stepped up worksite enforcement since President Donald Trump took office, conducting a number of large-scale raids at food-processing plants and gardening centers in recent years.

“These are not new laws, nor is the enforcement of them new,” acting ICE director Matt Albence said Wednesday.

“The arrests today were the result of a year-long criminal investigation. And the arrests and warrants that were executed today are just another step in that investigation.”

Video shows girl begging to see her mom

A tense scene unfolded outside a plant in Morton, Mississippi, as friends and family members clamored for information and buses rumbled by to pick up large groups of detained immigrants and take them away.

A Facebook video broadcast live at the scene showed an 11-year-old girl sobbing and begging an officer for a chance to see her mother as bystanders tried to comfort her.

Elizabeth Iraheta told CNN she shared the video so people would see what was happening at the chicken plant where she said she’s worked legally for 19 years. It was devastating, Iraheta said, to see family and friends suffering “just for coming to work hard in this country, and to see so many families separated.”

Iraheta’s video shows an officer noting that the mother is being processed “because she doesn’t have papers to be here legally,” then later telling the crying girl that her mother would be released and wouldn’t be deported. Eventually, Iraheta said, the girl’s mother was able to see her before she was taken away.

But Iraheta said she isn’t sure what will happen to the girl’s mother, how many people were detained at the plant where she works or what will happen to them now.

“Today was the first day of school. All the parents went to take their kids to school,” Iraheta said. “Now their kids maybe are alone. “

Albence, the acting ICE director, told reporters Wednesday that in the past the agency has worked with school liaisons to help “find placement” for children when their parents are detained.

“Most of the time, they’re placed with another family member,” he said, adding that each case would be evaluated and handled individually.

“Some of the parents that were arrested will be released and placed on an ankle monitor throughout (their immigration) proceedings,” he said.

Mayor: ‘What happens to the children?’

Several local officials criticized the operation.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called the raids “dehumanizing and ineffective,” issuing a statement calling for local houses of worship “to become sanctuaries for our immigrant neighbors and protect them from potential harm.”

William Truly Jr., the mayor of Canton, Mississippi, told reporters outside a processing plant owned by Peco Foods Inc. that he was concerned about the impact the arrests would have on the local economy.

“I recognize that ICE comes under the Department of Homeland Security, and this is an order of the United States. There’s nothing I don’t think anybody can do about it,” he said. “But my main concern is now, what happens to the children?”

Fears are running high in immigrant communities

Wednesday’s arrests come as anxiety is running high in many immigrant communities days after a gunman who apparently espoused anti-immigrant views killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.

Hurst acknowledged the recent tragedy in response to a reporter’s question Wednesday, but said the operation’s timing came as a result of careful planning in a lengthy investigation.

“This operation began over a year ago. You don’t bring over 650 special agents from across the country into the Southern District of Mississippi in a matter of three days without preparation for months and months and months,” he said. “So while the tragedies this weekend around the country are horrific, this operation had been planned way before that, and we intended to carry it out.”

In a statement provided to CNN affiliate WAPT, a company that owns several facilities where arrests occurred Wednesday said it is cooperating with investigators.

“We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and are navigating a potential disruption of operations,” Peco Foods Inc. said in a statement. “We adhere strongly to all local, state and federal laws including utilizing the government-based E-Verify program which screens new hires through the Social Security Administration as well as the Department of Homeland Security for compliance.”

54,54,"Dec 1, 2020",Ole Miss News,Center for Population Studies and Partners Host Hunger Summit,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s Center for Population Studies has partnered with two regional community organizations to launch the 2020 Hunger Summit, which provides a venue for community organizations and their partners to share information and support during the pandemic.

Partners in the effort are the Delta Directions Consortium and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. Starting in September, the Hunger Summit has convened the first Thursday of each month via Zoom.

“The Hunger Summit has been a great success,” said Terrence Hunter, fellow of the Delta Directions Consortium and alumnus of the Ole Miss School of Law who has moderated each of the sessions. “It is amazing seeing so many food pantries and food banks come together with a unified mission: combating food insecurity in the Mississippi Delta in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The concept for the Hunger Summit stems from a previous collaboration between the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Center for Population Studies. The first Desoto County Hunger Summit was held in Hernando in 2017.

This year’s summit was born out of a broader initiative between foundations and university entities to find out how food pantries and nonprofits were operating in the midst of the pandemic. The Maddox Foundation, Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi, partners within the Delta Directions Consortium and the UM Community First Research Center for Wellbeing and Creative Achievement joined forces to conduct social science, public health and legal research that would help pantries and other organizations providing food assistance to Mississippi families.

Before the pandemic, the Center for Population Studies, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi were already collaborating to identify challenges and opportunities in several north Mississippi communities, with the goal of building capacity and promoting community health and well-being.

With the onset of the pandemic, the focus narrowed to the critical and time-sensitive issues of addressing food insecurity and hunger in these communities.

“What began as a project for the future really turned out to be extremely impactful in the present,” said Robin Hurdle, president and CEO of the Maddox Foundation. “As schools and businesses closed, emergency resources and critical funding were desperately needed, and the homework done by so many for our original proposal laid the groundwork necessary to make the FEED Fund possible.”

The FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund was established at the Community Foundation to enable pantries and nonprofits to become self-sustaining.

Through the fund, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi have worked to raise and distribute money to allow food pantries and other organizations to serve more Mississippians in need and invest in their future. The fund has granted nearly $800,000 to nonprofits that are working to meet the academic, educational and nutritional needs of children.

With the Hunger Summit, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Delta Directions Consortium have been able to bring donors and nonprofits together to find innovative ways to meet the needs that Mississippians are experiencing as a result of the pandemic.

“The Hunger Summit has brought synergy to the foundation’s efforts to address the food insecurity needs in our region,” said Keith Fulcher, president of the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. “Partnerships have been formed with state, national and even international organizations whose mission is to feed the hungry. We could not have made these connections without the leadership of Delta Directions.”

The Community Foundation serves 11 counties in northwest Mississippi, assisting and connecting donors and nonprofit organizations and charitable causes.

The Delta Directions Consortium is an alliance of individuals, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and foundations committed to creating positive social change in the Mississippi Delta region. John Green, senior research associate at the Center for Population Studies, serves as a coordinator for this multi-institutional consortium.

Each 2020 Hunger Summit meeting presents relevant information or data to community partners, while providing a space for them to share challenges and successes. Participants have learned about the CARES Act reimbursement grant for food pantries and nonprofits, the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program, and federal and state food donation policies.

Hunger Summit and FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund research has included both the Center for Population Studies and the Harvard Law School’s Food Law and Policy Clinic – also a Delta Directions partner – with faculty, staff and students involved in presentations.

The final meeting of the 2020 Hunger Summit is set for 12:30 p.m. Thursday (Dec. 3). The summit is open to all who have an interest in best practices for meeting food assistance needs during these challenging times.

55,55,"May 31, 2020",The Guardian,'People are going to go hungry': pandemic effects could leave 54m Americans without food,"A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.

Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures.

As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year – a 63% increase compared to 2018.

Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

America’s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities.

It’s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020.

The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% – 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 – and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% – 4.8 points higher than 2018.

In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children.

Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen.

“We were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don’t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.

Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. “People are going to go hungry, that’s the truth,” said Scott.

The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year – a rise of almost 60% since 2018.

Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February.

“This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

On Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, 1,400 or so cars lined up at a mobile distribution point, which was open for three hours, for grocery boxes of canned fruits, pinto beans, pasta, milk, fresh vegetables, frozen meat and bread, to help make ends meet for a month.

Historically, there was a shortfall of 34m meals every year in the five counties served by the Community Food Bank of southern Arizona. Currently, the demand remains sky high – double pre-pandemic levels, and statewide 17% of the workforce have claimed unemployment since the start of the crisis.

“We were getting darn close to closing the meal gap before the crisis,” said Michael McDonald, the CEO. “But if demand continues at this rate for the rest of the year or into next year, we’re going to fall way short. I don’t see us being able to keep up without a longer-term commitment from the federal government.”

One in three children in Arizona could go hungry this year without food aid.

Food banks aren’t in it alone.

Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product.

In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)’s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries.

But it’s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights.

“Everything feels so unpredictable, I’ve literally no idea what’s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,” said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.

In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 – a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit. Only a tiny fraction of the USDA contracts went to distributors in New England.

As states start to reopen for business, economic recovery is expected to be painfully slow especially if further outbreaks are not adequately contained, which could trigger a full-blown second wave of the pandemic. Underemployment could last for years, which means millions of Americans are likely to need help with food, utilities and rent in the medium and long term.

Los Angeles county, where almost half the state of California’s Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, is projected to have 1.68 million food insecure people this year – the highest number in the country. It’s the most populous county in the US, with 10 million residents, where unemployment has risen to 20.3% – five percentage points higher than the state average – and food stamp applications have almost tripled compared with last year.

“If the numbers stay like this, no way food banks can cope, it’s beyond our capabilities, a lot will depend on how long federal help lasts,” said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Food Bank, which has distributed 80% more groceries since the pandemic began.

Susan King, president of Feeding Northeast Florida, agrees: “It’s when the dust settles that I’m most worried about, when the federal and state help is over but the line of people waiting for food is still long.”

King added: “This is a marathon, we can’t sugarcoat how scary it is; it absolutely keeps me up at night.”","Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

Over 1.2 million in the state are eligible and now receiving federal SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits which are administered by the state. The COVID-19 virus outbreak and resulting closing orders and restrictions on Michigan residents have left hundreds of thousands without jobs and struggling to keep afloat.

Last August, Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer decided some experts were needed to work to try and manage the worsening situation. She announced the formation of a Food Security Council. Its job is to review ongoing food assistance efforts and decide what else needs to be done.

The council issued a preliminary report last October. Now the panel is presenting new recommendations to the Governor. They involve three primary areas of concern. The first is the overall food needs of Michigan residents. The second is a collaboration between state government agencies and other public and private groups to maintain and improve supply chain issues. The third deals with fine-tuning existing food availability issues and even addressing things like panic buying.

Governor Whitmer says, “I formed the Food Security Council to make sure that all Michiganders – no matter their socioeconomic status – can put food on the table for themselves and their families. The needs are especially recognizable and critical during a pandemic but must continue to be addressed when the current crisis is over.

Nine years into the economic recovery, roughly one in eight U.S. households still struggle to get enough food to eat, at least occasionally, but the longer-term trend has been marked by gradual improvement.

Some 11.8 percent of American households — and slightly more in Arizona — were deemed ""food insecure,"" according to a report released Sept. 5 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

That definition means one or more members of these households faced some period during 2017 when their food intake was reduced and eating patterns disrupted, usually because of a lack of money.

Slightly more Arizonan households, 13.1 percent, were food insecure, placing the state in 18th place in this dubious measure. States were evaluated over a different three-year span, covering 2015 to 2017.

Neighboring New Mexico had the nation's highest rate of household food insecurity at 17.9 percent, followed by four Southern states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Hawaii had the lowest rate, 7.4 percent of households, slightly better than New Jersey and North Dakota.

Arizona improved from 12th place, and a 14.9 percent rate of food insecurity, in an earlier study covering 2013-15.

CLOSE From exports to jobs to daily tourist spending, the economic impact really adds up. azcentral.com

Occasional struggles

Authors of the report noted that most Americans don't face hunger throughout the year.

""When households experience very low food security in the United States, the resulting instances of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns are usually occasional or episodic, but not usually chronic,"" they said.

Nevertheless, Melissa Boteach, a senior vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, cited the report as evidence that ""far too many Americans, especially households with children, are struggling to put food on the table.""

In a statement, she attacked President Donald Trump for downplaying poverty and urged the White House to adopt policies such as a higher national minimum wage.

The latest 11.8 percent food-insecurity level marked an improvement from 12.3 percent in 2016. After peaking at 14.9 percent in 2011, in the wake of the recession, the rate has declined for six straight years. It hasn't dropped below 10 percent for the past two decades. It stood at 11.1 percent at the outset of the recession in 2007.

Jerry Brown, a spokesman for St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix, agreed that food insecurity has alleviated somewhat in Arizona recently, allowing his group to serve high-risk groups that the organization wasn't able to connect with earlier.

""We have been able to expand because we haven't been in an all-hands-on-deck situation, manning the lines to get food to people in need,"" he said.

Examples of St. Mary's expanded outreach include sending mobile-pantry trucks into high-need neighborhoods in the town of Guadalupe and the Maryvale community in west Phoenix and delivering food to public school systems on tribal reservations in northern Arizona.

High-risk groups

The latest study incorporated survey responses from more than 37,000 households, with help from the Census Bureau.

Nationally, 30.8 percent of people living below the poverty level dealt with food insecurity last year. Other groups with high rates included African-Americans (21.8 percent), Hispanics (18 percent) and households with children (15.7 percent), including those headed by a single woman (30.3 percent) or single man (19.7 percent).

Arizona has an above-average rate of food insecurity involving children, Brown said, citing information from another study. ""We still have about 400,000 kids facing food insecurity (in Arizona), but we're getting better,"" he said.

About three in five food-insecure households took advantage of one or more of the three main federal food assistance programs — SNAP or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps), the National School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Phil Bryant has signed criminal justice reform legislation that will ease reentry for people returning home from prison. Among the most notable elements of the new law is an opt out of a 23-year-old federal ban on food stamps and financial assistance for people with felony drug convictions. The change will help protect the many people who confront hunger and poverty upon their release from prison.

Mississippi is the latest state to amend or rescind this cruel federal policy, which emerged when the political consensus of the 1990s supported punitive and racially charged approaches to both drugs and poverty.

The changes followed years of congressional actions to establish harsh mandatory minimums for federal drug offenses and incentivize states to follow its lead in enacting long sentences. Unfair perceptions about people who use drugs, particularly crack cocaine, powered the debate.

While the law permits states to opt out of the ban, and ones as diverse as Arkansas, California, Maine and Wyoming have already done so, 30 states still maintain either a lifetime or modified ban on SNAP, TANF or both.

According to the National Institute of Health, 91 percent of people transitioning from incarceration report experiencing food insecurity. Moreover, employment opportunities for returning residents are limited because of outdated or inadequate skills, medical and mental health challenges and employer bias. A Harvard University study conducted by Bruce Western of 120 people in Boston found an initial average annual income of just $6,500 after incarceration.

The impoverished status of people leaving incarceration also exacerbates the financial conditions of the poor families to whom they return. By definition, families share with one another; more people in a household without more resources translates to less food for everyone in the family, including children.

States that have rejected the tough on crime approach to welfare reform have improved public safety outcomes. One study found that recidivism rates declined up to 10 percent one year after release when cash assistance and food stamps were immediately available to people returning home.

These reforms are foundational to successful reintegration.

Fortunately, Congress may be showing it has learned from the mistakes of its past. Last year, the U.S. Senate successfully held off an amendment incorporated into the House of Representatives’ bill to reauthorize SNAP that would have extended the lifetime food stamp ban to people convicted of violent offenses. The amendment, which would have permanently excluded people from accessing food assistance regardless of the date of their offense, was widely opposed by civil rights and anti-hunger organizations as well as conservative groups known for their embrace of criminal justice reform. Its defeat is a hopeful sign.

In Mississippi, an estimated 67,000 people — disproportionately women — will gain access to food stamps because of the state’s decision to lift the federal ban. While championing the new law, Republican state Sen. Sally Dotson said, “the overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities."" Evidence suggests that in this respect, Mississippi is on the right track.

The EdWeek Research Center’s analysis of recent U.S. Census Bureau survey data on families with children paints a picture of regional winners and losers, areas of progress even during the pandemic, and places where deficits remain entrenched amid the continued disruption of school and family life.

Among the key takeaways from the Census surveys conducted Oct. 28 through Nov. 9 of last year:

COVID-19 continues to squeeze many households with children enrolled in school. Nationally, 17 percent of such families said they lost employment income due to pandemic-related reasons during the survey period. But the impact is uneven: 19 percent of families in the Northeast and the South documented job loss or the inability to find a job, compared with 12 percent in the Midwest.

Families in every state began experiencing hunger during the pandemic. Nationwide, 16 percent of families who said they had enough to eat before the pandemic now say their children sometimes or often have to go without food.

Technology access remains uneven. Seventy-nine percent of households with children said they always had access to computer devices as of November, up from 71 percent in April. That same improvement wasn’t true for access to the home internet service crucial for remote instruction. That remained stagnant at around 75 percent.

States and regions vary widely in how much they think the pandemic has disrupted normal schooling. Nationally, 27 percent of households with students said that their current learning time was “much less than [in] a school day before the coronavirus pandemic.” But the numbers vary widely by state—from 42 percent in Nevada and Oregon to just 15 percent each in Florida and South Dakota, where schools were less likely to have adopted remote learning in response to the pandemic.

A closer look at the data illustrates how the pandemic’s effect on factors affecting readiness to learn—much like the disease itself—varies in location and in intensity.

Food insecurity is a regional issue

That disparity is especially true in an area that hits close to home: food insecurity. For example, the proportion of families reporting that they no longer have enough to eat is the highest in Mississippi, at 38 percent, and the lowest in Maine and South Dakota, each at 5 percent.

Regionally, the data show that pandemic-induced hunger issues are most severe in the West at 19 percent, and in the South at 18 percent. Overall, the Northeast appears to be struggling the least on this front at 12 percent, in contrast to having the largest earning loss relative to other regions. Additionally, only 14 percent of Midwestern households documented having issues with food security.

“Communities that had the highest levels of food insecurity prior to the pandemic have also been hit the hardest,” said Emily Engelhard, the managing director of research at Feeding America, an umbrella organization for food banks across the country. “Like Mississippi, these states in the South have higher levels of poverty, higher levels of unemployment. Across a number of those different socioeconomic indicators, you are seeing that people are worse off, and so food insecurity is going to fall into those social determinants of health.”

Engelhard describes a rise in demand, a drop in the number of volunteers, and supply chain problems all putting pressure on the charitable systems assisting those without food.

She and her team are currently piloting various programs, including giving clients the ability to preorder groceries from food banks. She is interested in seeing what works and what can be continued, if not expanded, after the pandemic.

On the related issue of income loss for families as a result of the pandemic, reasons cited in the survey data included falling ill with the virus, caring for sick loved ones, and children whose schools or day cares closed.

There’s uneven access to computers and Wi-Fi

With so many children learning from home, access to technology has become more important than ever.

“Schools have done a pretty good job at handing out devices in part because they had a lot of devices that were sitting on laptop carts,” said Evan Marwell, the founder of EducationSuperHighway, a nonprofit that works to alleviate internet access disparities. “Internet connectivity is a totally different animal.”

Marwell said school districts during the pandemic have mostly tried to do deals with carriers for mobile hotspots. He believes the better approach is working with cable companies to get families broadband directly. Marwell notes how hotspots often have coverage issues; often, the quality of the signal being available, especially in low-income neighborhoods, is weak and makes it difficult to do things like complete homework assignments.

Access to technology also is regionally inconsistent. Even though computers’ availability for educational purposes has improved across all regions, the South is still behind at 75 percent compared to the Northeast, at 83 percent, or the West, at 82 percent.

Wi-Fi access, meanwhile, has improved in the Northeast, going from 78 percent to 83 percent, and in the Midwest, increasing from 72 percent to 77 percent since April. But it has remained mostly stagnant in the South, decreasing to 71 percent from 72 percent. And the West Coast dropped in terms of internet access, from 77 percent in the spring to 75 percent in the more recent survey period.

“The more rural the state is, the worse off they’re going to be,” said Marwell, noting that there’s been little new infrastructure building during the pandemic in places that didn’t already have it. “And so when you talk about the Southern states and places like Mississippi, like there’s huge rural populations there.”

Surveys give a snapshot of lost learning time

It’s no surprise that the pandemic has affected the number of hours students spend on their education, and the Census data bear that out.

The Census asked specifically how much time students typically had spent on learning activities over the past seven days compared to the length of their school days before the coronavirus pandemic.

The South, at 24 percent, and Midwest, at 28 percent, were less likely to report having lost hours than the Northeast at 31 percent and the West at 30 percent.

In states at the lowest end of the spectrum for lost instructional time—including South Dakota, Florida, Nebraska, and Wyoming—households were the most likely to say that their children had not experienced remote learning, canceled classes, or any other changes resulting from the pandemic.

Nationally, most families with K-12 students in 44 states and the District of Columbia say classes normally taught in person had moved to some form of distance learning due to the pandemic during the 2020-21 school year.

The percentage of households experiencing the shift ranged from more than 90 percent in Oregon and the District of Columbia to less than 40 percent in Nebraska and South Dakota.

Students in the West at 82 percent were more likely to shift to distance learning than their counterparts in the Midwest at 64 percent. Those living in the South and Northeast changed to remote learning 69 percent and 70 percent, respectively. Only 1 percent of households in California and Oregon noted zero changes to their children’s education.

One in 10 households say their children’s education did not change due to the pandemic because their schools did not close for in-person instruction. That ranged from just 4 percent of households on the West Coast to 15 percent in the South and Midwest.

The crisis makes things worse for the most-vulnerable

Despite the many regional and state variations, the Census data confirm that households with school-age children in all states continue to suffer significant challenges to the resources and conditions needed to support students in the pandemic-disrupted learning environment.

But the data also pinpoint ironies in states’ individual experiences and show how the coronavirus amplifies issues for the most-vulnerable of populations.

South Dakotan families, for example, say that their children’s education hasn’t changed as much as in other states. However, South Dakota, alongside North Dakota, has had some of the virus’s highest case rates for COVID-19 since January 2020. According to developmental psychologists, this kind of stress alone influences the socioemotional development and executive functioning skills of children.

And Mississippi has always scored near the bottom with a C- grade on the Quality Counts the Chance-for-Success Index. This year, for example, it finishes 46th in the national index, which captures a wide range of socioeconomic indicators. The pandemic has only added to those deficits. Case in point: According to the recent Census data, 2 out of 5 households in Mississippi no longer have the same degree of certainty that they can feed their children.

60,60,"Sep 2, 2020",The New York Times,America at Hunger’s Edge,"A shadow of hunger looms over the United States. In the pandemic economy, nearly one in eight households doesn’t have enough to eat. The lockdown, with its epic lines at food banks, has revealed what was hidden in plain sight: that the struggle to make food last long enough, and to get food that’s healthful — what experts call ‘food insecurity’ — is a persistent one for millions of Americans. America at

Hunger’s Edge

Beginning in May, Brenda Ann Kenneally set out across the country, from New York to California, to capture the routines of Americans who struggle to feed their families, piecing together various forms of food assistance, community support and ingenuity to make it from one month to the next.

Food insecurity is as much about the threat of deprivation as it is about deprivation itself: A food-insecure life means a life lived in fear of hunger, and the psychological toll that takes. Like many hardships, this burden falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic families, who are almost twice as likely to experience food insecurity as white families.

Like so many who live at hunger’s edge, the members of the extended Stocklas family — whom Kenneally has photographed for years — gain and lose food stamps depending on fluctuating employment status in an unstable economy. They often have trouble stretching their funds to the end of the month, so they pool resources to provide family-style dinners for all. Tap to cycle through images When Kandice Zakrzewski, 25, was no longer eligible for food stamps, she stopped buying Lactaid for her son, Matthew Ratleph, 2. “We had to give that up for him. And just say ‘You can’t drink milk.’ Or we have to water it down.” Just days before Kenneally arrived, the governor closed schools statewide, creating a new source of stress for food-insecure families, which often rely on free school lunches to keep their school-age children fed. This made the family’s big collective meals all the more crucial. “Even if it’s just pitching in $10 when we don’t have food stamps,” Kandice Zakrzewski says, “we all pitch in.” Zakrzewski’s son Brayden Ratleph, 6. Kayla Stocklas. “We just kind of get our food and just all do our own thing,"" Zakrzewski says.

Late last year, Doris Hall, 63, moved back to Gary, her hometown, to look after her great-grandchildren — “so they don’t have to be in daycare,” she says. On weekends, she takes in as many as nine of the children — occasionally all 14 — so that their parents can work. Tap to cycle through images Hall’s rules are strict: naptime in the afternoon, bedtime at 9 p.m. and most important, whatever she cooks, they must eat. For lunch, it’s “microwaveable stuff,” like corndogs, hot dogs and chicken nuggets that Hall picks up at the nearby food bank. Dinners vary: spaghetti, chicken, soups, tacos. When she has a rare moment to eat alone, she makes her favorite meal for herself: greens and tacos. Some of Hall’s great-grandchildren waiting for lunch. Armani and Kimani Lacy, 5. “I never liked cooking,” Hall says, “but now that I’ve been taking care of the grandkids, I stay in the kitchen.”

In the face of deprivation, food-insecure families often seize any opportunity to get and store food when it’s available. In the middle of a food desert in Jackson, Miss., a family’s freezer holds as much as it can. Freezing milk in Erie, Pa., so nothing goes to waste. In Tucson, Ariz., a “cheap soup” made on the stovetop. In Gary, Ind., assembling a full meal from individual school-lunch portions of taco meat. Stockpiling supplies in Jackson, Miss. School lunches, and the single-serving milk cartons they often contain, are a mainstay for food-insecure households, like this one in Gary, Ind.

Kenneally arrived in Illinois in early June, soon after nationwide unemployment claims filed during the pandemic had topped 40 million.

In Cicero, just west of Chicago, Jennifer Villa, 29, was living in an apartment with a kitchen that needed plumbing repairs. She and her family were already struggling — a disability makes it hard for her to work — and the pandemic had meant less fresh food and even longer pantry lines. Tap to cycle through images Temporarily without a working kitchen, Villa organized the food she received from food pantries in the alleyway outside her home. Whenever food deliveries came, Villa’s kids would celebrate. “Oh, Mommy, we’re going to have food tonight,” they would tell her. “We’re not going to go to sleep with no food in our tummy.” Armani Rodriguez Sonia Rodriguez

By June, the social upheavals following the killing of George Floyd created even more instability for some families. Kenneally visited Manausha Russ, 28, a few days after protests led to the closure of a nearby Family Dollar, where Russ used to get basics like milk, cereal and diapers. “The stores by my house were all looted,” she says. Tap to cycle through images From left, Aliza, 1, Nyla, 6, Amarri, 5, and Kadynce, 8, with their mother, Manausha Russ. Russ lives with her four daughters on the west side of St. Louis. She receives about $635 per month in food stamps, but with the girls at home all day, and her partner, Lamarr, there too, it isn’t always sufficient. “Some days I feel like I have a lot,” she says, “and some days I feel like I don’t have enough.” The family moved into their current apartment about six months ago. Russ doesn’t have a dining table or chairs yet, so the girls eat on the floor.

In so many places, Kenneally found food-insecure families were helping one another out despite their own hardship. Here, in a condominium complex on the city’s east side, a neighbor picked up free school lunches and distributed them to children in the building, including the Boughton sisters: Brooklyn, 4, on the far right, Chynna, 9, and Katie, 8, seen here with a neighbor’s toddler who has since moved away.

Most of the families Kenneally photographed had struggled to feed themselves adequately for years. But she also met families who had been thrown into food insecurity by the pandemic.

By late June, Kenneally had reached Mississippi, where the economic toll of Covid-19 was falling hard on some of America’s most chronically impoverished areas, where residents have lived under hunger’s shadow for years. The pandemic dropped the state’s labor participation rate to just 53 percent, the lowest in the nation.

Even before the pandemic, more than half of Mississippi’s seniors — 56 percent — experienced regular shortfalls in food. One in 4 Mississippians is now experiencing food insecurity, according to the nonprofit Feeding America. The kitchen of Helen O’Bryant and her daughter, Nita, in Greenwood, Miss. “We’re learning to enjoy life a little better,” says Helen, 72, sitting beside Nita, 45. “Cooking helps, it really does.

Whitehead says he spends about $150 on groceries every two weeks, plus he gets boxes of food from a nearby church. He also catches bream from a local lake. “I cook about 10, and I put the rest of them up in the freezer. Then when we need to eat them, I defrost them.”

The city of Jackson (population 164,000) is often classified as a “food desert” for its high rate of food insecurity and the scarcity of well-stocked stores.

In early July, the pandemic was cresting in Texas just as Kenneally arrived.

Kelly Rivera, a single mother with three kids who makes $688 every two weeks as a teacher’s aide, goes to the food bank on Wednesdays to supplement what she is able to buy with food stamps. “There are times they give you what you need, and there are times they don’t give you what you need,” she says. “You can’t be picky.” Tap to cycle through images Rivera’s children eat Cheetos on the couch after returning home from picking up groceries.

Some 800 miles west in New Mexico, near the town of Hatch, workers pick onions for $15 a box, which translates to less than a minimum wage for many workers. There are no food pantries nearby, and so the workers are forced to eat extremely simply on their earnings, making nearly everything they eat from scratch. Tap to cycle through images At the beginning of the onion season, a priest came to the field at dawn to bless the harvest. Juan Pablo Reyes is using the money he made picking onions to help pay for college. “People that work at the bottom of the food chain, cultivating all these different crops, are basically the builders of our country,” he says. Yasmin and Yeslin Reyes, 11, are the only members of their family who don’t work in the onion fields, but that will change next summer. Their older brothers started when they turned 12, and the same is expected of them. Juan Pablo’s high school graduation cap says “Proud Immigrant” and has flowers in the colors of the Mexican flag.

Leaving New Mexico, Kenneally headed west across Arizona. She finished her journey in Southern California at the end of July. The story there was no different than it had been across the country, except that wildfires were also beginning to ravage the state — yet another crisis in a year full of them.

Kenneally’s photographs reveal the fragility of American life, exposed and exacerbated by the pandemic. They show us how close to the edge so many families live, how vulnerable and insecure their arrangements are, and also how resilient they can be when faced with a crisis.

61,61,"May 31, 2020",CNN,'Not moving fast enough': Millions of children still without food aid,"(CNN) Millions of low-income school children are still waiting receive federal help to buy food, even as the number of families having trouble affording groceries skyrockets .

Eleven states, including Georgia, Mississippi and Utah, have yet to join the federal coronavirus relief program that gives families money in place of the meals their children would have received in school for free or a reduced price.

But even in states already participating in the Pandemic EBT program , millions of children haven't gotten assistance -- more than two months after schools closed.

""We know that families are losing jobs and wages, and P-EBT really is an amazing support that can help these families, but it's not moving fast enough,"" said Crystal FitzSimons, director of school programs at the Food Research & Action Center. ""It is concerning that it's taking so long and we know that families are in crisis.""

Congress created the Pandemic EBT program as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in mid-March, when states started shuttering schools, making it harder for children to receive these crucial meals.

Some 22 million children eat a free or reduced-price lunch at school each day, on average. While districts are trying to provide alternative arrangements, it's only reaching a small fraction of those in need.

At the same time, food insecurity among families is growing as unemployment soars amid the pandemic. More than 40% of mothers with children age 12 and under said in April that the food they bought didn't last and they didn't have enough money to get more, up from about 15% in 2018, according to a recent survey from the Brookings Institution.

""Looking over time, particularly to the relatively small increase in child food insecurity during the Great Recession, it is clear that young children are experiencing food insecurity to an extent unprecedented in modern times,"" wrote Lauren Bauer, the survey's author.

Money for meals

The Pandemic EBT provision provides about $114 a month per child, which is the value of a free breakfast and lunch for five school days a week. Eligible families will receive the funds for the time their schools were closed, typically from mid-March, until the end of the school year sometime in May or June, depending on the state.

The program, however, has been challenging to set up. It took three weeks for the US Department of Agriculture to approve the first state -- Michigan -- and only 17 states were given the nod in April. Another 21 states have received the go-ahead so far in May.

But even once they get approval, states face multiple hurdles in getting the funds to families, particularly those who aren't already in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. In many states, there are far more eligible households in this category than those who receive food stamps, who will simply have the additional funds added to their existing benefit cards.

States have to work with their school districts to identify all the qualified children in households that aren't on food stamps and then send them benefit cards with the funds.

Also, they have to pick up the ""not inconsiderable"" cost of issuing the cards to these households at a time when they are suffering budget crunches, said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Some states are automatically providing the funds to families who don't receive food stamps. But others -- including California, Missouri and Illinois -- are requiring them to apply for the benefit, sometimes because it's harder for the school districts to transfer the records to the social service agencies. But this may delay or prevent some households from participating.

Many states have started sending funds to families, particularly those already in the food stamp program. But many others, including New York, Maryland and Florida -- which together have more than 4.5 million eligible children, have said they won't distribute the money until June at the earliest.

In Virginia, the roughly 620,000 eligible children should have their Pandemic EBT funds on the families' cards or in the mail by Monday, at the latest, said Duke Storen, commissioner of the state's Department of Social Services.

The agency, which received federal approval in late April, had been concerned that it would take more time to deliver the benefits to the children who needed cards -- about half the total -- because of a limited supply. However, the vendor recently delivered the full batch, allowing the state to distribute the funds more quickly.

Still, Storen knows the money -- $376 per child for 66 missed days of school -- can't come soon enough for some children and their parents.

""While I wish we could have put the benefit in the hands of families sooner -- they needed them a month ago, but they also need these benefits today,"" said Storen, whose agency spent $2 million to administer the program, half of which will be reimbursed by the federal government.

Not yet participating

Nearly a dozen states, however, have yet to join the program, and that has an impact on their young residents.

At Marietta City Schools in Georgia, 60% of the 8,000 students would qualify for the Pandemic EBT, according to Superintendent Grant Rivera.

Even with the grab-and-go meal program they have offered while the schools have been closed, it's been difficult to reach all the eligible students, he told CNN. Only 34% of have participated.

Having a card with money on it would be a ""game-changer for kids,"" he said.

""What I've seen overwhelmingly is that they desperately need this food,"" Rivera said. ""And I've heard anecdotally from countless families that they've lost their jobs. Unemployment has not processed. They literally don't know how they're going to feed their kids.""

Utah, meanwhile, was unable to apply because of ""several obstacles in data collection,"" a spokesperson for the state Department of Workforce Services told CNN in a statement.

""Looking at the guidelines we found several obstacles in data collection of students receiving free and reduced lunch in order to determine eligibility,"" said spokesman Brooke Porter Coles. ""This obstacle made it difficult to meet the deadline for participation. Utah is diligently working with our federal and educational partners to create a solution in order to provide this benefit.""","(CNN) Millions of low-income school children are still waiting receive federal help to buy food, even as the number of families having trouble affording groceries skyrockets .

62,62,"Jun 10, 2020",EcoWatch,UN Warns of Impending Food Crisis,"The United Nations issued a dire warning on Tuesday that the world stands on the brink of the worst food crisis in the last 50 years, according to The Guardian.



The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world is facing an ""impending global food emergency"" that could impact hundreds of millions of people as the coronavirus pandemic threatens already strained supply chains, according to Hong Kong-based Asia Times. He warned that the recessions that follow the pandemic will put basic nutrition out of reach for millions.

""Our food systems are failing, and the Covid-19 pandemic is making things worse,"" the UN chief said in a statement accompanying a report by the UN. ""More than 820 million people are hungry. ""Some 144 million children under the age of five are stunted – more than one in five children worldwide."" That's particularly troubling as malnutrition has lifelong consequences. If the number of children who suffer from malnutrition grows, it is likely to cause increased stunting and provide a future strain on health care systems.

Guterres warned that ""this year, some 49 million extra people may fall into extreme poverty due to the Covid-19 crisis,"" according to Asia Times. ""Unless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending global food emergency that could have long-term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults,"" as The Guardian reported. ""We need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic."" The UN Secretary-General provided a three-point plan for attacking the hunger crisis: focus aid on the worst-stricken areas to avoid immediate disaster, to improve social safety nets so children, pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers along with other at-risk group receive adequate nutrition, and to invest in healthy and sustainable food systems and supply chains for the future, according to Guterres' statement.

The latest data in the report, The Impact of COVID-19 on Food Security and Nutrition, found that the food security of 135 million people is at crisis level or worse. That number could nearly double before the end of the year due to the impacts of COVID-19. Increasing unemployment and the loss of income associated with lockdowns are also putting food out of reach for many struggling people, the report found, according to The Guardian. While global markets have remained steady, the cost for basic foods has begun to rise in some countries. The report also expects harvests to slow down, since many seasonal laborers are unable to work or travel for work.

63,63,"Sep 27, 2020",Arkansas Online,Pandemic has fewer kids getting meals at schools,"In a state where many children didn't get enough to eat before the pandemic, changes to kindergarten-through-12th-grade education threaten to widen the hunger divide.

Participation in school meal programs -- a linchpin in children's nutrition, especially for those who get free or reduced-price lunches -- has dropped in many districts around the state this fall, administrators say.

That's true even though most districts opted in on a federal program that allows all students to eat at no out-of-pocket costs through December.

More than half of Arkansas' schoolchildren are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, so missed lunches and breakfasts indicate potential gaps in access to food as schools move to feed the kids in new ways. Missed meals are also troubling indicators, experts say, amid an upswing in nationwide food insecurity tied to this year's economic recession.

In Arkansas and elsewhere, the recession-tied burden weighs most heavily on Black, Hispanic and other children of color and their families, experts and advocates say.

""Anywhere there's a hungry child, I can guarantee you there's an entire hungry family"" because parents will go without to make sure their kids are fed, said Arkansas Food Bank Chief Executive Officer Rhonda Sanders. ""I think most people tend to forget that.""

Since schools reopened in August, just a fraction of families who chose to have their children attend classes virtually are going to school to pick up breakfasts and lunches, officials say. Also, the number of students getting their meals in school cafeterias is down, attributed to safety fears unassuaged by extra cleaning and food-packaging measures.

In the Pocahontas School District, about 300 students chose all-virtual learning this fall, and child nutrition director Patty Moore said she is sending food home for approximately 30 of them each week. That can mean the district will receive less in reimbursements for meals served, she said, and saddle families with the extra food costs.

Even if families in the area are among a recent surge in state applicants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) -- a successor to the food stamp program -- ""I know it's costing more for them to [feed kids at home] than if their kids come to school and eat,"" Moore said.

The same situation is evident among remote learners in the Fort Smith and North Little Rock school districts. In the latter, a spokesman estimated that fewer than 25% of the district's virtual learners are going to schools to get their meals, and acknowledged that ""transportation might be an issue.""

The Arkansas Department of Education isn't tracking specific data on meals distributed to virtual learners, but the agency's Child Nutrition Unit has fielded calls from administrators concerned about meal participation this school year, spokeswoman Kim Mundell wrote in an email.

Accounts from districts overall point to children eating less frequently at school and having less access to food since the spring pandemic community lockdowns.

In May, one national survey found that four in 10 adults with children eligible for free and reduced-price lunches weren't getting replacement assistance, said food insecurity expert Elaine Waxman.

Across the country, news reports this summer documented long lines of cars and unprecedented demand at food banks as millions of people lost jobs and businesses closed because of the pandemic.

Waxman, who is a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank The Urban Institute, said this fall's reports of fewer children eating school-provided meals ""doesn't surprise"" her and ""is probably not an indication that families don't need the help -- just that the logistics may work against participation.""

Jeremy Everett, founder and executive director of the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, said he has heard a few similar concerns about lower school meals participation, though it's not enough to know if the situation is nationwide.

""Many of the children are at home alone while their parents work and are unable to leave to go get their meals,"" he said in an email.

""It seems that the primary barrier is transportation. Children and parents are having a difficult time getting to the meals to pick them up when available, and schools do not have the capacity to make home deliveries.""

The end of many coronavirus relief programs, such as the weekly $600 unemployment insurance supplement that expired in July, coupled with sporadic or skipped meals offered through schools undermine efforts to keep kids from going hungry.

Those efforts, which experts and officials view as successful, include many districts opting in on a U.S. Department of Agriculture waiver that allows districts to serve children free lunches even if the family's income is higher than the usually limit. The program will cover about $80 million in costs through December, state Education Secretary Johnny Key said at a Sept. 2 media briefing.

The initiative will reduce administrative burdens at schools, as well as worry for families who ""might not qualify for free meals, but are still going through a tough time,"" Key said.

Melanie Hyso, 42, of Bentonville said efforts by state and federal governments this year helped her feed her 16-year-old, 12-year-old and 7-year-old. She praised the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) assistance program, which federal legislation created in March. It offered $319 per child for families eligible for free or reduced-price lunches because schools had closed.

Hyso said she's ""so grateful' for the assistance card, which arrived later than she'd expected, during the costly run-up to the fall semester.

""You're trying to get supplies, and clothes, and shoes, and all this stuff, and I'm like, 'oh my god, where is it?'"" she said.

While schools were shut down in the spring and summer, her district delivered basic meals -- corn dogs, sandwiches, vegetable sticks -- to the family's house. Her son's mentor and a therapist sometimes chipped in to help, at one point dropping off a birthday cake, she said.

All of it, she said, helped during a period of budgets strained by the kids spending more time at home, using more electricity to run their learning devices or eating lunch at home rather than at school.

""We've gotten really good at getting creative,"" she said.

'GRAB AND GO'

Declining participation in school meal programs is the most recent challenge in feeding kids during a year administrators say is out of the ordinary and stressful, and began with the abrupt closure of schools in the state in mid-March.

The closures presented a challenge for districts trying to feed thousands of children who were no longer going to school every day, especially kids who rely on free and reduced-price school lunches and breakfasts.

That's the majority of Arkansas schoolchildren, state Department of Education data show. Of 263 districts and charter schools in Arkansas, 223 had more than half of their students participate in those meals programs in the 2019-20 school year. The Marvell-Elaine School District and the Helena/West Helena School District have more than 95% of students enrolled in meals programs.

Ally Mrachek, child nutrition director for Fayetteville Public Schools, said she ""kind of saw the writing on the wall"" and began planning before schools closed last spring, but she called the experience ""surreal"" nonetheless.

""We saw other districts across the country closing, and we weren't getting a lot of communication in our state,"" she said. ""We were driving forklifts and box trucks, and really trying to move food as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.""

By March 20, the USDA relaxed several of its rules on school nutrition programs, including those pertaining to eating in group settings, what time children must eat and prohibitions on parents picking up food.

Food banks in the state also joined in, packing emergency boxes, connecting children with commodities programs and distributing ""farm to family"" food boxes.

Common strategies for districts included facilitating meal pickup hours for families and delivering meals to community drop points or neighborhoods, officials said. But there were challenges.

For example, El Dorado School District workers packed some lunches not knowing whether families had access to refrigeration or freezers at home, said Kim Newman, the district's child nutrition director.

By summer, more rule modifications, extensions of waivers and an existing districtwide free student meals program allowed the food providers to drive into neighborhoods and feed any child they saw, she said.

""We would just roll down the windows and say, 'Hey, are you hungry? Want some lunch?'"" Newman said.

Summer food programs adapted menus to better ensure food safety, including ""more sandwich-type meals,"" because food has to be served at a certain temperature, said Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education Director Tonya Williams. She said programs for young kids shifted similarly, offering ""grab and go"" meals, though most of those programs now have reverted to their normal format.

""We're seeing a lot of people go back to work and have to be somewhere, so there's less of a need for 'grab and go' options,"" she said.

NO QUICK FIX

Food insecurity -- largely a measure of economic struggles -- is different from hunger. It means not consistently having enough money to buy food. For example, a woman who is food insecure might run out of money to buy food before payday and have to change her eating habits or cut out a meal.

It's long been a problem in Arkansas, a state with many low-income households. In 2018, the state had the nation's second-highest rate of food insecurity, behind only Mississippi, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Feeding America. The group operates six food banks in Arkansas.

Food insecurity is expected to increase this year because of the pandemic, a group of researchers from that organization found. Researchers project food insecurity rates will increase by 50% or more in Benton, Washington, Saline, Carroll, Lonoke and Faulkner counties, and grow at least 24% in every county in the state.

Experts say it can take years for a family to recover from a period of food insecurity -- similar to what was seen during the recession in 2008, when it took between seven and 10 years for households to recover.

The pandemic has thrown more than 10 million kids, whose families struggle with access to food, in turmoil this year, said Crystal FitzSimons, director of school and out-of-school programs at the Washington, D.C.,-based Food Research and Action Center.

Normally in times of economic shocks like job loss, a parent can sign up through schools for food assistance programs for their kids, but the pandemic upended that.

""We had a hunger crisis before the pandemic, and the pandemic just made it worse,"" she said. ""This was a situation where, overnight, communities had to try to figure out how to set up these feeding programs.""

Early responses from communities and the government drew praise from advocates. Those responses included boosts in unemployment benefits as facilitated by the federal Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act; $1,200 payments to many Americans; the P-EBT aid program; and relying on distribution frameworks in existing summer food programs.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

The federal government also briefly bumped up SNAP payments and waived several requirements around the program to make it easier for people to enroll, said Mary Franklin, Division of County Operations Director, which oversees the program in Arkansas.

But experts expressed concern about some limits in the response, including stalled negotiations in Congress regarding a new coronavirus relief package. Also, continued funding for the P-EBT program depends on the passage of a congressional spending bill that cleared the House on Tuesday.

In this year's unprecedented crisis, families also may encounter complex problems. For example, mixed-immigration-status families might not apply for pandemic aid that they're entitled to, fearing that it might affect their future citizenship applications, the Urban Institute's Waxman said.

""If you're already vulnerable, then the pandemic is just layered on that,"" she said.

State data bears out the rising need, with nearly 10,000 more households enrolled in SNAP in August than in April. Food banks across the state also are ""seeing increases"" in people seeking help, and a rise in food insecurity is expected, said Sanders, the food bank CEO.

""It's not going to just automatically drop back to where it was. There's too many jobs that have been lost; there's too many dollars that have been pulled out of the economy,"" she said.

FUTURE WORRIES

School lunch and breakfast programs can significantly ease a family's food budget by providing as many as 10 meals a week (and sometimes more for very low-income families) -- which is why a decline in their use is viewed as worrisome.

The goal is for children to lead healthy, productive lives, and ""that's impossible"" if they're hungry, said Melvin Clayton, race equity director for advocacy at Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. Experts link growing up in a food-insecure household with later-in-life health challenges, such as cognitive delays, asthma and other chronic illnesses.

Several Arkansas school districts -- including the large Benton, Bentonville, Fayetteville and Cabot districts -- are in counties where food insecurity is projected to increase the most while also seeing historically low rates of free and reduced-price lunch participation, suggesting a gap between what's happened in the past and what may be needed.

This year, the Education Department's child nutrition unit has recommended that schools develop community partnerships to help connect virtually-educated students with meals, and review and revise distribution plans if participation is low. Some districts have experimented with food pickup times, moving to once-weekly or evening pickups.

Meal distribution is ""costly,"" the Department of Education spokeswoman said, and there are no USDA funds available to help districts shoulder it.

The Arkansas Food Bank is establishing a handful of on-campus food pantries at schools around the state in a pilot program, and Sanders said it has prepared to shift back to assembling emergency food boxes quickly in case schools are forced to close on a large scale again.

Beyond schools, advocates support the extension and expansion of relief programs, encouraging less restrictive rules and urging community leaders to speak out against the perceived stigma of people using those programs. One rule that should be waived, they say, is Arkansas' ""asset limit"" of $2,250 on hand to qualify for SNAP aid.

For students attending school in person and eating on campus, much is changed in cafeterias and classrooms because of the pandemic. There are physical distancing measures, staggered lunch hours, and changes in how students handle food and condiments. Disposable utensils, dishes and cups are being used, but that also increases schools' costs and trash.

Across districts, food being sent home -- sometimes because of students suddenly being sent into quarantine -- is usually straightforward and child-friendly. Meal options include chicken nuggets or spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch, and cereal or string cheese for breakfast.

School officials say there's some uncertainty about what the rest of the school year will look like.

Mrachek, the Fayetteville director, said that's prompted her to try to sign up as many families as possible for free and reduced-price meals for the spring semester, even families that may not have used such programs in the past. Toward that end, the district created videos in English and Spanish to explain the applications, which schools must submit by Oct. 1.

""Families won't rebound as fast as that cutoff date [in December for USDA waiver programs]. I don't know if families will be back on their feet by then,"" she said.

STARKVILLE, Miss. — A state authority on food security will be featured at Mississippi State Friday [March 23] for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences’ Charles E. Lindley Lecture.

Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, will present “Mississippi: the Hungriest State in the Nation” at 11 a.m. in the Taylor Auditorium of McCool Hall. The state ranks first in food insecurity with 26.3 percent of the senior population and 28.7 percent of the state’s children considered food insecure.

The Mississippi Food Network, an 80,000-square-foot Jackson facility, provides meals to more than 150,000 people and distributes 1.5 million pounds of food through its 430 member agencies. As the state’s only Feeding America affiliated food bank, MFN is on the front line of defense in helping feed Mississippians who are food insecure. Beady has helmed the organization since 2014, serving as only the third CEO in the organization’s 34-year history.

Beady spent 20 years as president of The Piney Woods School, one of the nation’s four remaining historically black boarding schools just south of Jackson. Immediately prior to joining MFN, he was associate director of the Virgin Islands University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities.

Beady earned a bachelor’s degree in advertising, a master’s degree in urban counseling and his doctoral degree in counselor education, all from Michigan State University. He was a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University.

Palm Beach County is the state’s number one agricultural producing county, growing vegetables in the winter when other states are too cold, and sugar cane and rice. It’s been an economic engine for decades, with some farmers in business here since the 1930s.

With an estimated $1.4 billion in agricultural sales for 2017-18, Palm Beach County leads all counties east of the Mississippi River, according to the Palm Beach County Cooperative Extension Service. Among the bounty is enough lettuce to make 1 billion salads a year and enough sweet corn to supply 150 million people for two months.

What’s ahead for the industry that dates to the 1870s, when serious commercial farming began with pineapples and tomatoes? Will it be run over by development or bought out for additional water conservation or Everglades restoration projects?

It's a fair question to ask given the trends in counties to our south, where lands used for farming got paved over for residential development from Homestead to Dania Beach. Another potentially undermining factor are environmental concerns, specifically discharges from Lake Okeechobee.

>>PALM BEACH COUNTY 2030: How will we grow? The next decade promises significant changes to the landscape and look of Palm Beach County. READ MORE

Palm Beach County farmers say they see viability and longevity for their agribusiness.

“There are a thousand people a day moving into Florida, and land availability is becoming a scarcity,"" said Paul Allen, chairman of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association (FFVA). ""But I think that our lawmakers and government, every time I talk to them, they understand that for seven months out of the year, fresh fruit and vegetables coming out of Florida take care of 80 million people east of the Mississippi.”

>>Palm Beach County in 2030: Hispanics leading the way for population growth

For starters, Allen and others say, there is a greater emphasis today on food security — so lands dedicated to farming are viewed with greater importance. Despite encroachment by development, county farmers are generally thriving, boosted by new technologies, disease-resistant crops and diversity of crop varieties.

Allen is also president of Pahokee-based R.C. Hatton Farms. The farm produces sugar cane, sweet corn and green beans on 10,000 acres in Palm Beach County.

“Food is a matter of national security. Our government understands that totally. I think they will provide for land in Florida to be farmed on,” Allen said.

With billions of dollars from packinghouses to sugar mills, harvesting equipment, transportation systems and more invested in one of the nation’s most ideal growing regions, agribusiness is thriving in western Palm Beach County and around the farming communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee and South Bay and in Loxahatchee to the east. Major vegetable growers continue to produce in the Agricultural Reserve west of the turnpike in south county, although their numbers are shrinking as residential and commercial development increases.

About 36 percent of the county’s land mass, or just over 451,000 acres, was in agriculture in 2017-18, according to Palm Beach County property appraiser records.

Palm Beach County’s production is primarily in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) south of Lake Okeechobee, where sugar cane accounts for 390,767 acres. In the Glades, Loxahatchee, and the Ag Reserve, vegetables are grown in multiple plantings per season on close to 25,000 acres, appraiser records show. Tropical fruit groves, 396 landscape nurseries, land for horses, goats, swine, honey production, fish farms and sod farms make up the rest.

New technology and improved disease-resistant and constantly evolving crop varieties developed by U.S. Department of Agriculture and University of Florida researchers are also helping farmers to become more efficient and produce more per acre.

>>Palm Beach County in 2030: New western communities attract buyers — and raise traffic concerns

“My hope is that they remain the economic engine they are,"" said Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay, who represents the Glades. ""It is a multi-billion(-dollar) economic engine in our county. They are going to face pressure from different sources.”

One of those ""sources"" is pressure to curtail, or resolve, the dispute over discharges of fresh water from Lake Okeechobee, which are believed to pollute waterways a with toxic algae and raise other water quality issues.

McKinlay said she worries that ""extremists"" on both sides of the Lake Okeechobee water discharge battle seek to force out farmers.

“Some of those extremists would like to see agriculture disappear and turn that all into wetlands and restoration areas. It is important that we grow our own produce domestically. We need to protect the farming communities that are able to do that for us,” McKinlay said.

McKinlay adds that forcing out the farmers might open land to even more damaging uses.

“My fear if we were to eliminate agriculture in the western communities is that we would see one of four things — oil drilling, phosphate mining, aggregate mining or intensive development. I don’t think any of those are environmentally friendly in that part of the county,” McKinlay said.

Residential development would be an option, as happened in both Miami-Dade and Broward counties to the south.

“I never want to fly over the Glades communities and look downward and see something like Weston,” McKinlay said. “We are struggling right now with discharges and water storage. It will not be any better if we turn it all into gated communities. My hope for 2030 is a thriving agricultural industry that continues to improve their technology to be more efficient.”

Growers say their future is in new crops, not new homes, and one in particular, hemp.

Farmers are always looking to diversify with a new crop, whether it’s mini-peppers, micro-greens or kale, and there’s increasing interest in growing hemp for products such as fiber, forages to feed cattle, building materials and food such as hemp seed oil and greens and medicinal cannabidiol (CBD) extract in the near future.

After the May passage of legislation establishing a state hemp program, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said Florida is on the verge of creating what could become a multi-billion industry.

“Hemp is a big topic right now. You are always looking to diversify your operation,” said Keith Wedgworth, president of the Western Palm Beach County Farm Bureau and vice president of Wedgworth Farms, said. Wedgworth Farms, founded in 1932 in Belle Glade, farms and owns 10,000 acres of sugar cane and rice.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the legislation legalizing industrial hemp production, so now the rule-making process will begin.

Zachary Brym, an assistant professor of agro-ecology at the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead leads UF’s Industrial Hemp Pilot Project.

For now, hemp production is limited to UF facilities. Production trials are under way at UF research centers in Homestead, Hague (near Gainesville) and Quincy (near Tallahassee). The project needs to identify the best hemp varieties for the region as well as how existing farming equipment and operations can be adapted.

At a recent meeting in Belle Glade, Brym explained that hemp is not marijuana, although they are the same species of plant, Cannabis sativa. Industrial hemp has less than 0.3 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical that at a higher level defines marijuana.

Despite the buzz about hemp, farmers and industry experts believe vegetables and sugar cane will continue to make up most of the county’s agriculture for years to come.

But at least one hemp enterprise is on the horizon in Palm Beach County.

Whitworth Farms, a long-time Ag Reserve vegetable grower, has leased about 200 acres to Green Point Research of Fort Lauderdale with the goal of producing hemp. Green Point Research is also partnering with UF and initially donated 200,000 seeds and 100 living plants to the Industrial Hemp Pilot Project, with more to come.

That said, farmers acknowledge challenges in competing against global exports and imports.

Glenn Whitworth Jr. said that because of cheap produce coming in from Mexico, the farm, in business for 70 years, shuttered its vegetable operations for good in the spring of 2018.

U.S. and Florida growers of tomatoes, peppers, squash and other crops are fighting to survive in the face of increased competition from Mexico where subsidies are greater and production costs lower. The outcome of the signed but not ratified new trade agreement between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. — called USMCA, a renegotiation of NAFTA — does not include a trade remedy for U.S. specialty crop producers.

FFVA’s director of policy, Lisa Lochridge, said competition from the Mexican imports has reached a crisis stage for Florida growers of crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, squash, strawberries and blueberries. The Florida congressional delegation has said they will not vote for a USMCA that doesn’t include a solution.

With consumers demanding locally grown produce and a safe and secure food supply, however, the need for Florida produce is strong.

Lochridge said the demand for convenience packaging such as ready-to-microwave veggies will continue to accelerate. However, despite the healthful benefits of fruits and vegetables, consumption is down in the last few years.

“Consumer trends certainly dictate how our growers market their products,” Lochridge said. “Shoppers want somebody else to do the work for them. Convenience packaged foods and prepared meals are immensely popular.""

How the Palm Beach agri-industry will evolve in the next decade is also up to a key demographic group, millennials.

“Millennials are changing the landscape in their buying and eating habits. If you look at trends, they eat more smaller meals,” Lochridge added. “People want to eat on the go. Their choices may be less nutritious. We have to offer healthy nutritious fruit and vegetable options for that quick snacking.”

State Rep. Rick Roth, R-Wellington, president of Roth Farms with sugar cane and vegetables on 5,000 acres east of Belle Glade, agrees that a trade agreement with Mexico is needed to help the coastal farmers survive.

“It looks like the East Coast vegetable farming will continue to go down,” Roth said.

Farmers of lettuce, sweet corn and green beans grown in the Glades are not competing with Mexico, which doesn’t ship those in any significant amount, Roth said.

While Roth believes farming will continue to prosper in the Glades, he said more land could be taken out of agriculture for stormwater treatment areas. Due to the natural evaporation of muck, some land could become too shallow to farm.

“You will have some loss. What will be compensated is that sugar cane production is continuing to expand outside of Palm Beach County. Having more acres is the key to being sustainable,” Roth said.

In the Glades, where Belle Glade’s slogan is “Her soil is her fortune,” the rich black muck isn’t suitable for construction, FFVA’s Allen said, although it can be done. Muck must be removed prior to building.

“They do build on it, but as far as mass production, it is different. The best use for the mucklands in the EAA is production. Its highest and best use is to produce food,” Allen said.

Water issues are at the top of growers’ concerns statewide, and they want to be part of the solution for clean, sustainable water long term for all of Florida, Allen said.

In 1992, the county’s agricultural acreage was 576,012, compared to today’s approximately 450,000 acres. Much of the difference of 126,181 acres is due to the South Florida Water Management District buying more than 100,000 acres for stormwater treatment areas and other restoration projects over the last 15 to 20 years.

Since 2008, the number of agricultural acres in Palm Beach County has decreased by only 17,033 acres, according to Palm Beach County Property Appraiser records. Farmers say that it’s crucial that no more land be taken out of production in the Glades.

“Agriculture will remain a strong economic engine in Palm Beach County in 2030. The land mass devoted to agriculture may shrink due to environmental and development pressure. However, variety development and advanced agricultural practices will yield more food per acre,” said Barbara Miedema, president of Wellington-based Terra-Rio Consulting, who has worked for years in the sugar industry.

Farm Bureau president Wedgworth said he hopes the acreage has stabilized, but that of course no one knows for sure.

There must be enough cane production to support the Glades’ four sugar mills. A reduction could cause the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida’s mill to fail and small to-medium-sized farmers would be hurt the most, Wedgworth said.

Despite the shrinkage, farmers have continued to produce more per acre. They have also invested millions in new state-of-the-art production and packing facilities such as those at Pioneer Growers and Ray’s Heritage in the Glades, and Alderman Farms, which has a 300-acre organic farm in Loxahatchee and farms in the Ag Reserve.

In the Ag Reserve, where development pressure is greater, the future is less certain as the number of houses built approaches 10,000. A $100 million bond issue passed by Palm Beach County voters in 1999 resulted in county purchasing 2,335 acres in the Ag Reserve. The land is leased back to farmers.

However, in 2018, the Palm Beach County Commission extended the leases for 35 more years for 1,138 acres to long-time farming family and tree nursery owners the Bowmans, and 262 acres leased to the Bedners. The Bedners have been farming cucumbers and peppers in Palm Beach County since 1960.

Other major vegetable-growing operations in the Ag Reserve include Pero Family Farms, Thomas Produce, Yee Farms, Alderman Farms, Mecca Farms and herb grower Pontano, along with nurseries and equestrian facilities.

A new venture in the Ag Reserve is Green Life Farms, a hydroponic greenhouse and packing facility on 3 acres off State Road 7 west of Lake Worth Beach, which expects to produce 750,000 pounds of baby leafy greens per year.

Elayne Dudley, sales director at Green Life, said construction is nearing completion. The facility will include 100,00 square feet of growing space, plus packaging and office space. It expects to begin commercial operation in midsummer.

In Loxahatchee, farms such as vegetable producer J & J Farms, which partners with Thomas Produce, Swank Specialty Produce, and several fruit and vegetable growers along with ornamental plant nurseries, are thriving. Some sugar cane is planted on the sand lands there.

The sugar cane industry has expanded more onto sand lands, and to other counties, such as Hendry and Glades. It’s vertically integrated, providing farm-to-table products. The cane produced in Florida goes through sugar mills and then refineries that are owned by the growers. Sugar cane producers have their own packaging plants and distribute directly to retailers such as Publix and Walmart without a middleman, making profits larger.

U.S. Sugar Corp. has its own refinery in Clewiston. The Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative in Belle Glade and West Palm Beach-based Florida Crystals Corp. jointly own ASR Group. Headquartered in West Palm Beach, ASR is the world’s largest refiner and marketer of cane sugar, with an annual production capacity of more than 6 million tons of sugar

With the Glades is expected to remain a major sugar producer, what does that mean for future development?

Roth said that as available land in eastern Palm Beach County to becomes harder to find, and more expensive, the ability to develop properties in the Glades along main corridors will become a reality.

As to whether farmers will sell out, U.S. Sugar Corp. vice president Judy Sanchez said: “Farmers’ first option is to make their money farming. Like any other businessman, economics may force them to do something else. Then they must look at second or third options and selling land might be one of those.”

GPS-enabled tractors and drones used to check on crops and other technology used in precision agriculture continue to drive efficiency. More advances such as driverless tractors being rolled out by John Deere and other companies, are expected in the next few years.

U.S. Sugar has the nation’s largest private Wi-Fi network across more than 200,000 acres of its sugar cane and vegetable farms, Sanchez said. It’s also the “alpha” site for new harvesting software utilizing a technology similar to Uber, but for tractors. An app locates the nearest available wagon and sends it to the harvester.

“Much of our farm equipment is now 'smart' equipment, including AutoSteer mechanical harvesters that harvest our sugar cane crops,” Sanchez said.

“Our fleet of tractors and harvesters are equipped with GPS technology that reduce fuel use, enable precise fertilization right at the plants’ roots and increase yield at harvest as plants are in perfectly straight rows,"" said Marianne Martinez, vice president at Florida Crystals Corp.

“Satellite imagery guides our remote sensing and allows us to instantly detect pressure from disease, insects, water, either too much or too little, or weather, such as freeze damage, on a farm-by-farm basis and rapidly address it,” Martinez added. “In the past these activities were done visually by driving around the farming area or through helicopters.”

In 2018, Florida Crystals and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative invested $80 million to launch Tellus Products. At its plant near Belle Glade, leftover sugar cane fiber is converted into eco-friendly compostable tableware and food-service products that are in high demand as alternatives to plastic and Styrofoam. Tellus is in production and has created more than 80 local jobs.

“The crop mix may change over time due to market demands, but sugar cane production will remain the signature crop in the Glades due to the high investments in manufacturing and value-added facilities,” said Terra-Rio's Miedema.

Other possible new developments in the Glades include an inland port and a commerce center.

Gaston Cantens, vice president at Florida Crystals, said the inland port project, also known as the South Florida Intermodal Logistics Center, is on hold for now, as the demand isn’t there yet. The proposal to build the distribution center on 850 acres the sugar company owns off U.S. 27 just north of South Bay in unincorporated Palm Beach County has been under discussion for about a decade.

However, a major commerce park could be coming to Belle Glade soon. In 2014, a group of Wellington-based investors paid $1.2 million for a 212-acre parcel in Belle Glade that once housed Glades Correctional Institution. Now the investor group, BGI International, is selling land to companies who want to operate there.

Last year, the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County announced that Universal Forest Products, a major manufacturer of concrete construction productions, paid $33.7 million for the land and planned to build a 400,000-square-foot factory on the former prison site and employ 200 people.

Two companies are already operating from the property. Grower’s Management, a grower of leafy greens, sweet corn and green beans, occupies three remodeled office buildings, and World Trade Petroleum has equipment there.

Belle Glade City Manager Lomax Harrelle and BGI managing partner Henry Rionda did not respond to requests for comment on the project’s status.

“The project has not fully come to fruition, and I am not at liberty to discuss details since there are some remaining issues,"" said Shereena Coleman, vice president for business facilitation and the Glades region at the Business Development Board of the Palm Beaches.

“Agriculture will always be the fabric of the Glades community due to the massive amount of land currently in production, and we are not seeing any conversions to other uses,” Coleman said.

The BDB is also working with the Pahokee Marina and Campground and restaurant to find an operator, which would jump-start that city, Coleman added.

Belle Glade, Pahokee and South Bay all fall within the state’s South Central Rural Areas of Economic Opportunity, making projects eligible for certain waivers, bonuses and incentives. The BDB is marketing a piece of land in South Bay for manufacturing/light industrial, Coleman said.

One positive sign is the large number of young people choosing to work in Palm Beach County agriculture.

The Florida Farm Bureau’s Young Farmers & Ranchers Group in Palm Beach County has a couple dozen members, and farmers say that says a lot about the strength and long-term viability of the county’s agriculture.

Luis Ruiz grew up in Belle Glade, surrounded by vast acres of farmland with ink-black muck soil. Although his family doesn’t own any agricultural land, Ruiz chose a career in the industry.

At 18, he started working for Wedgworth Farms. Now 25, he’s assistant farm manager, where his duties include overseeing planting. Growing crops that supply food for people is rewarding, he said and he sees a future for the industry.

“I knew this is what I wanted to do and be. The people are great. It’s like a family,” said Ruiz, who took business classes at Palm Beach State College. “It is never the same. It’s different every day.”

66,66,"Aug 30, 2019",Healthcare Finance News,SDOH: Food insecurity adds $53 billion annually to healthcare costs,"Food insecurity costs the health system an additional $53 billion a year, according to Dr. Hilary Seligman, senior medical advisor for Feeding America and co-author of a study that looks at the issue state-by-state.

Food insecurity can lead to diabetes, heart disease and other chronic conditions, all of which are costly to health and the healthcare system.

""What's important to understand is the connection between food insecurity and health,"" said Seligman, an associate professor at the University of California San Francisco. ""When people don't have enough money for food, they use coping strategies, shifting their dietary intake to unhealthy food. It's these coping strategies that are so poor for your health.""

Also, she said, ""Being chronically ill is expensive in the U.S. Money is going to healthcare rather than the food budget.""

Over a lifetime, it's hard to undo the effects of a poor diet and its consequences.

""A small improvement in children may have enormous outcomes in the future,"" Seligman said.

Food insecurity encompasses more than hunger, or wondering where the next meal is coming from. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Food insecurity has become a major issue for hospitals, which have been making the transition to value-based care and its goal to keep people healthy.

Chronic conditions are a major reason for hospital admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits, all of which are targeted in value-based payment models.

Illness in a value-based system cannot be addressed without identifying the underlying environmental, social and behavioral issues that drive ill health.

Payers Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers offer incentives to reward wellness, coordinated care and better health outcomes.

Anthem Foundation Executive Director Lance Chrisman, who has worked for Anthem's philanthropic arm for about 13 years, said food insecurity has always been an issue, but in the past five years, the talk about addressing the social determinants of health has ramped up.

The foundation is flooded with requests for funding and gives an estimated $16 million to various programs each year.

But one of the primary areas of focus for the Anthem Foundation is food insecurity.

""When we start seeing the data and background: one in eight Americans, 40 million adults, 12 million children struggle with food insecurity,"" Chrisman said.

WHAT'S BEING DONE

The Anthem Foundation recently partnered with The Food Trust and its community-based program, the Healthy Food Retail Initiative, to increase access to healthy food in Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and San Jose, California.

The Anthem Foundation gave a $350,000 grant to the Food Trust Program to launch beta testing in those cities to take the Healthy Food Retail Initiative to scale.

The money subsidizes the cost of fresh fruit, produce and other healthy food to be sold at low cost in 37 existing brick and mortar markets and convenience stores. This includes five additional communities on the Eastside of Indianapolis, where these locations also serve as community health hubs providing health screenings, nutrition education and cooking lessons.

A 2019 Fitness Index found that only 33.9 percent of Indianapolis residents are eating two or more fruits a day and just 15.1 percent of residents are eating three or more vegetables each day. Data also showed more than one in three Indianapolis residents live in low food access areas where fresh food is difficult to find.

Anthem has made other food insecurity investments in the Feeding America program, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks, a program for college students in Virginia and in Blessings in a Backpack for elementary school kids.

This is food as medicine, Chrisman said.

""We believe eating healthy is just as important as taking medications,""

Seligman said individuals pay more attention to the edict to take advantage of better food choices available on-site at the hospital grocery pantry or the local food bank, if that comes from their physician.

""It feels the same as getting a prescription,"" Seligman said.

However, she said, ""The best answer for a food insecure household is SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).""

Hospitals are also a good source of finding people who are food insecure.

THE LARGER TREND

""We're just at the tip of the iceberg to understand whether they're working,"" Seligman said of programs. ""We think if they're supporting food security, they're working.""

Hospitals, insurers and organizations nationwide have launched food insecurity, housing and other social determinants of health initiatives. When Montifiore in New York City invested in housing the homeless, it realized a 300% return on investment from savings, such as fewer emergency room visits.

Massachusetts recently introduced the Massachusetts Food as Medicine State Plan.

At last count, 28 health systems had joined the Medicaid Transformation Project to improve the health of underserved individuals and to drive new solutions for untreated depression, teen suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder and mental illness.

""There is a vision of a much more broad scale support,"" Seligman said, adding, ""there is no financing mechanism.""

What motivated her report was being approached by food banks and healthcare partners that wanted to know the impact of food insecurity in their local communities.

THE DATA

The study, ""State-Level and County-Level Estimates of Health Care Costs Associated with Food Insecurity,"" includes an interactive map that breaks down healthcare costs associated with food insecurity on a state level.

For the analysis, the authors used 2011-2013 data from the National Health Interview Survey the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 2012-2013 data from the Dartmouth Atlas and 2016 data from Map the Meal Gap 2018.

The authors found that among approximately 28 million food-insecure adults and 13 million food-insecure children in the United States in 2016, the excess cost associated with food insecurity translates to approximately $52.9 billion in excess healthcare expenditures.

Key findings include:

On average, healthcare costs for food insecure adults is $1,834 higher than people who are food secure.

The state with the highest healthcare cost per capita associated with food insecurity is Mississippi, at $243 per person. Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Oklahoma are also among the top five states.

The state with the lowest healthcare cost per capita associated with food insecurity is North Dakota, at $78 per person.

ON THE RECORD

""We've known for a long time,"" Seligman said, ""if we eliminate programs in food security, we end up with extra cost in the healthcare sector.""

67,67,"Dec 14, 2020",Uprise RI,"Food security, housing security and mental health for families: RI ranks near the bottom","A shocking new report from the Annie E Casey Foundation, Kids, Families and COVID-19: Pandemic Pain Points and a Roadmap for Recovery, shows that Rhode Island is falling below average when it comes to ensuring housing stability, mental health, and child hunger for families.

The KIDS COUNT report used data gathered from weekly weekly surveys conducted by the United States Census Bureau (the Census Pulse Survey) that shows that families are struggling to meet basic needs during this pandemic “while managing school, work, and mental health.”

“By measuring food security, the ability to make rent or mortgage payments, health insurance status, and mental health concerns, the Casey Foundation identified four pain points for children and families that require immediate action,” writes Rhode Island KIDS COUNT in a press release. “Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, and New Hampshire appeared among the top 10 states in terms of doing better on three or all four of the pain points identified in the report. States in the bottom 10 that were doing worse on three or all four categories were Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Texas.”

Percentages of Rhode Island families with children who have experienced challenges as measured by these four indicators are listed below. According to the Census Pulse Survey, in Rhode Island:

FOOD SECURITY: Nearly one in five families with children (18%) said that in the most recent week, there was sometimes or always not enough to eat in their household (compared to United States average of 14%). HOUSING STABILITY: Nearly one in four households with kids (23%) said they had only slight confidence or no confidence at all that they would be able to make their next rent or mortgage payment on time (compared to United States average of 18%). MENTAL HEALTH: A quarter of respondents with children in their households (25%) reported that they had felt down, depressed, or hopeless in the previous week, indicating a widespread need for access to mental health care (compared to United States average of 21%. AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE: 8% of adults in households with kids did not have health insurance (compared to United States average of 12%).

“All children deserve to have their basic needs met in normal times and in times of crisis,” said Elizabeth Burke Bryant, Executive Director of Rhode Island KIDS COUNT. “Too many Rhode Islanders were struggling to survive economically before this crisis. Now that the devastating effects of the pandemic are falling on the shoulders of our most vulnerable children and families, we need immediate and sustained action to ensure the best outcomes. Our leaders have taken some important actions to mitigate the effects of the crisis on kids, but Congress needs to do more. We call on Congress to pass another major relief bill that addresses the urgent needs of children and families.”

Though congressional action is needed to prevent the worst possible outcomes, the report does have some suggestions that can be implemented at the state and local levels.

In some states, fewer than 20% of unemployed workers received any support before the pandemic, and those excluded were disproportionately workers of color. Unemployment insurance did not rescue everyone who lost a job; many workers were ineligible or unable to claim it, and some families’ needs exceeded the temporary support. Expanding eligibility to include contract, gig and other workers would help more people weather gaps in income. In addition, more states should consider adopting a modest allowance for each child in a household. Twelve states have already done this. Even providing families with an extra $5 to $15 per week per child – as Iowa now offers, for example – would help parents make sure their children have enough food to eat.

Researchers have estimated that school systems need to spend 100% to 200% more per student from a low-income family and 100% to 150% more per English language learner in order to provide every student with the opportunity to achieve success. Yet some states provide as little as 10% more, in part because of heavy reliance on property taxes to fund schools . Additionally, equity policies in local school districts are a potentially powerful tool needed now for creating environments in which all kids can thrive. Equity policies serve as a guidepost for the work of a district and can provide the framework for how to embed a focus on racial equity in areas such as instruction, curriculum, discipline and resource allocation. They will be especially needed as schools face the reality that disparate access to technology and other resources is leading to more significant learning loss for some students during the pandemic than for others.

They will be especially needed as schools face the reality that disparate access to technology and other resources is leading to more significant learning loss for some students during the pandemic than for others. Children most often receive mental health services through the schools they attend. The American School Counselor Association recommends a student-to-counselor ratio of 250:1, but only three states – New Hampshire, Vermont and Wyoming – have ratios at least that low. Federal and state governments and local school districts could direct more funding toward hiring and equitably distributing counselors or making other investments in mental health services.

More generally, the Annie E Casey Foundation is calling on elected officials and other decision makers to:

Put racial and ethnic equity first in policymaking by using disaggregated data and engaging community stakeholders. This should ensure that the policymaking process is informed by the diverse perspectives of those hardest hit by the crisis and created in partnership with communities. This approach should underpin any concrete policy actions.

Prioritize the physical and mental health of all children by guaranteeing that any vaccine will be available without cost as a factor and by retaining and strengthening the Affordable Care Act. To promote mental health, particularly in times of crisis, policymakers should work to reduce the student-to-school-counselor ratio in all school settings to levels recommended by mental health professionals.

Help families with children achieve financial stability and bolster their well-being by expanding access to unemployment insurance for part-time and gig economy workers, low-wage workers, and students and by expanding child care access. Additionally, policymakers should eliminate barriers to accessing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). And beyond any temporary housing assistance programs aimed at heading off a foreclosure or eviction crisis, federal policymakers should expand the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and increase the overall availability of public housing.

Ensure schools are better funded, more equitably funded and ready to meet the needs of students disparately affected by the pandemic by boosting school funding to protect against the economic impact of the pandemic, build maintenance-of-equity requirements into relief packages and address disparities in technology access at home and in the classroom.

“America’s children are in crisis,” said Annie E Casey Foundation President and CEO Lisa Hamilton. “All across the country, families with children are struggling to overcome an unprecedented convergence of emergencies. We need immediate and decisive action from policymakers that prioritizes equitable solutions to help families survive this catastrophe.”

When the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Revere HealthCare Center opened its therapeutic food pantry in January 2020, the plan was to start off with a three-month, 10-patient pilot program. The pantry would provide plenty of plant-based, healthy food to the patients, all of whom had nutrition-dependent chronic diseases, like diabetes and obesity, and were food insecure, meaning they lacked enough food to live a healthy and active life.

“Of course, then COVID hit,” says Jacob Mirsky, MD, a primary care physician at MGH Revere and the food pantry’s medical director.

The number of community members in the Boston area struggling to access nutritious food jumped in March as the measures put in place to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic hit them economically. Mirsky and his team decided to rehaul the entire operation and expand service to every patient treated at the center and their families.

With funding from MGH Revere and partnerships with local food nonprofits, the pantry grew from operating out of a closet to filling a 1,000-square-foot storage space and feeding up to 80 patients and their families each week.

Food insecurity across the country has risen significantly since the pandemic sidelined 14 million workers in the United States from February to May, according to the Pew Research Center.

Feeding America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States, estimates that 17 million people in the country could become food insecure because of the pandemic, bringing the total to more than 54 million people in the country, including 18 million children. Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.

Since food insecurity and poor nutrition are associated with several chronic illnesses that put people at higher risk for the more severe complications of COVID-19, the food access crisis threatens to exacerbate the already glaring disparities in health outcomes for vulnerable people, including low-income people, children, older adults, and immigrants living in the United States illegally.

“Though the factors underlying racial and ethnic disparities in Covid-19 in the United States are multifaceted and complex, long-standing disparities in nutrition and obesity play a crucial role in the health inequities unfolding during the pandemic,” writes a cohort of physicians and researchers in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September. “A healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and calorie-dense processed foods, is essential to health. The ability to eat a healthy diet is largely determined by one’s access to affordable, healthy foods — a consequence of the conditions and environment in which one lives.”

Mirsky believes that it is incumbent upon the health care system, and particularly academic medical centers, to take on a greater role in educating and connecting patients to healthy and tasty foods — and consequently reduce the prevalence of nutrition-related illnesses.

“We’re now living in a world where it is abundantly clear that the power of doctors and medical students and trainees expands beyond the walls of a health care setting,” Mirsky says. “Building these types of solutions [that address social determinants of health] is just as important — if not more important — than prescribing them medicine.”

Food is medicine

Over the past decade, a growing body of research has linked poor nutrition to poor health outcomes, particularly in patients with chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. This can stem from not only a lack of food but also an excess of unhealthy food that can cause obesity and contribute to other health problems. For many, this could be because they live in a food desert, where there are no grocery stores within a mile of their home, or because unhealthy food may be cheaper and easier to access.

The research has birthed a movement known as “Food is Medicine,” where physicians, nutrition experts, and policymakers encourage the use of programs that provide medically-tailored food to prevent and treat serious illnesses in patients, as opposed to relying solely on pharmaceuticals and other health care interventions.

“Food is really critically important for many of the diseases that are plaguing our country and the world,” Mirsky says.

A report published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2017 found that food insecurity was associated with 10 of the costliest and most deadly preventable diseases in the country, including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.

Conversely, a healthier diet, particularly one that focuses on plant-based meals, has been associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases, depression, and decreased mental function.

Barriers to access

But for millions of people in the United States, eating enough nutritious food is far easier said than done. Certain groups living in the United States face additional barriers and risks when it comes to nutrition and health, particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Children: Nearly 30 million children in the United States qualified for free or reduced-cost lunches at school in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated food insecurity among children, as the estimated number of food-insecure kids could jump from 11 million to an estimated 18 million, according to Feeding America. While many schools have continued to provide meals to children in need and food banks and pantries have amped up services, the disruption could have concerning long-term consequences. Studies have linked food insecurity in children to poor health, stunted development, behavioral issues, and difficulty keeping up in school, according to Feeding America.

Older adults: Seniors, generally defined as people age 65 and older, are at increased risk of the more severe complications that come with COVID-19. Consequently, those who live on low and fixed incomes face greater barriers to accessing adequate nutrition. This can, in turn, further increase their vulnerability to poor health outcomes.

“A lot of older adults, unfortunately, don’t have a generous retirement income,” explains David Buys, PhD, MSPH, an associate professor at Mississippi State University Extension and College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who has studied food insecurity in older adults. “They might be living on nothing but Social Security. Some might not have Social Security. We know that we have an increasing number of grandparents raising grandchildren … that can be a challenge.”

Buys says that older adults who are frail or lack transportation may struggle to get to the grocery store or to a food pantry — and that some are afraid to go out and risk exposing themselves to infection.

Food banks, food pantries, and other community outreach organizations have had to be creative in ways that they serve older adults since the pandemic hit, such as delivering food to their homes, drawing on long-standing programs like Meals on Wheels, Buys says.

One study from before the pandemic found that, in a group of older adults discharged from the hospital, those seniors that received meals delivered by Meals on Wheels had lower rates of hospital readmission in three and six months than expected.

Providing healthy meals can be a key to keeping older adults healthy and out of the hospital or congregate health care situations that might increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. It’s an issue of particular concern since more than 84% of people over the age of 65 have at least one chronic condition and many face economic hardship as a result of medical debt, according to the National Council on Aging.

Immigrants in the United States illegally: While Latino communities in the United States in general have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, immigrants in the country without legal permission — many of whom are Latino — are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity because they are not eligible for many government relief programs. Even before the pandemic, 1 in 4 experienced food insecurity, according to a 2016 report by Bread for the World, a nonprofit dedicated to ending hunger.

While Medicaid programs in some states, including California and Massachusetts, are beginning to cover the cost of programs that provide food to patients, people living in the country illegally are not eligible for Medicaid. Nor are they eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, nor the $1,200 stimulus check that the federal government approved earlier this year.

“We see a movement right now to integrate more food and nutrition services into health care delivery and financing,” explains Sarah Downer, JD, associate director of whole person care at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School. “But every gap that we have is a place where undocumented immigrants fall into that gap.”

Instead, many rely on local food pantries for aid, which were stretched thin early in the pandemic while trying to accommodate millions of new clients, says David Velasquez, a fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School who is also pursuing a master of business administration at Harvard Business School and a master in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.

“Food is a basic human need. And it’s something that we all deserve.” David Velasquez

Fourth-year medical student at Harvard Medical School

Velasquez, who experienced food insecurity himself as the child of Nicaraguan parents who originally came to the United States illegally before being granted asylum, decided during the early months of the pandemic to research policies that could support food access for immigrants during this crisis.

He teamed up with another Harvard medical student, Jordan Kondo, and two attorneys from the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, Downer and Emily Broad Lieb, JD, to write a journal article that argued for policies that could help bring relief to immigrants who aren’t eligible for much government aid.

For example, they said the government should make it a priority to fund emergency food services programs that are accessible to those living in the country illegally, such as food banks and community health centers, and that health systems should ensure that they are not excluded from programs that integrate nutrition into health care delivery.

“Food is a basic human need,” Velasquez says. “And it’s something that we all deserve.”

Facing a long-term problem

When Mirsky was crafting the model for MGH Revere’s therapeutic food pantry, it was important to him that the pantry provide not only nutritious food but also the means to enjoy it.

Patients who visited the pantry initially received pots and pans, a spatula, oil, spices, and consultations with a nutritionist who could help them come up with recipes that they enjoy. The goal is to foster self-motivated healthy lifestyles. When the pantry expanded to a greater number of patients due to the pandemic, they could no longer offer all these services, but they hope to reintroduce them in the future.

“Food and eating are an essential part of the human experience,” Mirsky says. “Cooking and enjoying healthy food is a very powerful and respectful way of improving someone’s life.”

The MGH Revere pantry in the Boston area is just one of many nutrition outreach programs that health care providers across the country have increasingly implemented in recent years, as the American Hospital Association highlights in its social determinants of health report series. More health care providers are screening for food insecurity regularly and helping connect their patients to resources.

Still, food insecurity persisted before the pandemic, and the pandemic has further stretched existing community resources, as NPR reported in September.

Mirsky notes that the pantry at MGH Revere is already feeling the strain and is leading an effort to raise funds for a permanent location for the pantry. He’s also concerned about how much food they will be able to acquire in the winter, when there will be less local produce available and as renewed COVID-19 surges threaten to further stress systems.

“Our goal is to recognize that this is a very long-term problem that is going to require a long-term solution.”","Before COVID-19, food insecurity was at its lowest since the Great Recession, but it still impacted 37 million people.
The therapeutic food pantry at the MGH Revere HealthCare Center in the Boston area provides healthy, plant-based food for all patients.
The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated food insecurity among children, as the estimated number of food-insecure kids could jump from 11 million to an estimated 18 million, according to Feeding America.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A senior scientist from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture presents research on gender equity in global aquaculture and fishery industries next week at Mississippi State.

On Thursday [Feb. 6], Steven Cole is discussing “Gender dynamics in small-scale fisheries and aquaculture” at 9:30 a.m. in the Colvard Student Union’s Fowlkes Auditorium. The event is free to all and sponsored by the MSU-based Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, or Fish Innovation Lab, and the university’s Social Science Research Center.

The Fish Innovation Lab is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and part of the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for global populations dependent on aquaculture- and fisheries-led economies. MSU leads the lab through its Global Center for Aquatic Food Security, directed by Mark Lawrence, professor in MSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

Cole’s presentation will highlight the dynamics that shape women’s participation in aquaculture and fishery industries, as well as the benefits derived from them. He will discuss the increase in gender research, the knowledge gaps that remain, and how filling these gaps is important to enhancing food, nutrition and economic security of people with low incomes.

“We are fortunate to have Dr. Cole visit MSU to share his knowledge on this topic,” said Lawrence. “His expertise in the relationships between gender, agriculture, and food, nutrition and economic security will be of interest to researchers and technicians in a variety of fields.”

As a gender specialist with the IITA, Cole is based in the Eastern Africa Hub in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He employs a mixed methodology in his research and works collaboratively with biophysical scientists to ensure that agriculture research for development has greater impact. He has led the social science research for WorldFish in Zambia for the past six years, integrating gender and other social science perspectives in aquaculture, small-scale fisheries, value chains and nutrition research.

Cole obtained his Ph.D. in biological anthropology from the University of Arizona in 2012. He also holds a master’s degree in agricultural and resource economics and a bachelor’s in health and nutrition.

74,74,"Jan 9, 2019",CBS News,"Food stamp funding extended amid shutdown, but only through February","The partial government shutdown has glided into its third week with no end in sight. If the government is not reopened before March, millions of Americans who receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — the nation's food stamp program — could have their assistance disrupted. The funding provided for SNAP and other programs through February is only a temporary fix.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Tuesday that SNAP would be funded through February, thanks to the funding bill that expired on Dec. 22, which included a provision allowing federal agencies to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date.

In September 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in SNAP benefits were disbursed throughout every state. If the shutdown continues through March, there will be no remaining funding for SNAP, endangering food security for millions of Americans.

According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 42 million Americans received SNAP benefits in 2017. More than 68 percent of participants were in families with children, and more than 44 percent were in working families.

Other programs were in even more immediate danger than SNAP. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) were not receiving federal funds at all during the shutdown, but ""can continue to operate at the State and local level with any funding and commodity resources that remain available,"" according to the USDA in December.

However, the USDA announced Tuesday that WIC would continue to operate through February, thanks to ""prior year funding which USDA will begin to provide states this week.""

In the first five months of 2018, around 7 million Americans received WIC benefits each month. WIC is provided for pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who fall within the poverty index and are at ""nutritional risk."" The WIC program granted nearly $5 billion to every U.S. state and territory in 2018, as of September.

Americans who benefit from both SNAP and WIC would be particularly affected if the shutdown continues past February.

Child Nutrition Programs, including School Lunch, School Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Feeding, Summer Food Service and Special Milk will continue operations through February, according to the USDA.

Staffing for Food and Nutrition Services, which oversees the Child Nutrition Programs, SNAP, and WIC, has been cut by 95 percent since the shutdown began.","In September 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in SNAP benefits were disbursed throughout every state.

76,76,"Nov 17, 2020",Ole Miss News,Grove Grocery is Students Helping Students,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s food pantry is now known as Grove Grocery and though the name is different, its student-led fight against hunger and the stigma around food insecurity continues.

Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213. Workers wear masks and follow all campus protocols while they serve students. It’s open 3-8 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays and noon to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.

It’s exciting to see the organization grow to be able to help more students, and also help them in new ways, said Chloe Grant, Grove Grocery director and a senior biology major from St. Louis.

“One of my main goals as the food pantry’s director is to help de-stigmatize food insecurity and to help people feel more comfortable with getting the resources they deserve,” Grant said. “I think many students, faculty and staff don’t use the food pantry because they’re embarrassed or because they feel like they aren’t needy enough.

“However, we want everyone to know that we’re here to help them – without judgement – so that they can focus on what really matters in life.”

Grove Grocery has received a $10,000 donation from Kroger, which is part of a new and continuing partnership. Company representatives visited Grove Grocery recently and recorded video interviews with Ole Miss students to share with Kroger employees across the Delta region.

There’s also an Ignite campaign to benefit the pantry and help it to serve as many students and others as possible.

Many people find themselves struggling financially during the ongoing pandemic, said Kate Forster, staff adviser for Grove Grocery. Usage has gone up, including an increased need for hygiene products and other personal items, she said.

“Our utilization has gone up,” Forster said. “It has brought a spotlight to the work of Grove Grocery, and the needs on campus. We would think that on a campus like this and in a place so rich with resources, students would never go hungry. Still, many students are facing very difficult monthly decisions.

“We always want to raise awareness about our services in a de-stigmatizing way. We really try to remove as many barriers as possible to students and employees finding what they need.”

Here’s a full list of Grove Grocery’s services.

While usage has gone up, donations have increased, as well. Forster believes many people find themselves wanting to help others during COVID. She said its rewarding to see the work at Grove Grocery is both student-led and heavily supported by students.

“One in three college students during their undergraduate years will experience food insecurity,” Forster said. “This semester, we’ve given out over 1,800 meals and more than 700 meal swipes.

“We are in a good place to support the community’s needs, and we want to raise awareness. There is a lot of good happening here.”

The pantry takes feedback from clients about their needs, and collects those items. They’ve also partnered to provide “meal swipes” on student and employee ID cards. Those who need swipes can apply here.

Grove Grocery is a good way to help those in need, especially now, said Kieran Murphy, assistant director and a junior management major from Ocean Springs.

“We have so many important goals and ideas we try to implement so that we can ensure the most people get the help they need,” Murphy said. “I am very humbled and honored to serve in a role that allows me to feel that I’m making a difference in people’s lives, and it will always be an experience I will remember and cherish.”

Mary Beth Gillespie, another Grove Grocery assistant director and a senior biology major from Brandon, said she first heard of the pantry as a sophomore. It’s become a “passion project” for her because it helps so many, she said.

“Working with the food pantry has not only impacted my time at Ole Miss, but it has also shaped my outlook on my future and how I would like to continue to combat food insecurity as someone pursuing a career in dentistry,” Gillespie said. “The food pantry is continuing to grow and expand, and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store.”","Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213.

77,77,"Nov 11, 2020",The New York Times,Somebody’s Watching: Hackers Breach Ring Home Security Cameras,"“Our security team has investigated this incident and we have no evidence of an unauthorized intrusion or compromise of Ring’s systems or network,” the statement said. “Recently, we were made aware of an incident where malicious actors obtained some Ring users’ account credentials (e.g., user name and password) from a separate, external, non-Ring service and reused them to log in to some Ring accounts.”

Ring users can monitor the cameras on the company’s smartphone app and speak to people inside their home and at their front door using a two-way audio feature. But cybersecurity experts say all it takes is a user name and password for hackers to gain access to the devices.

Ring said it began sending emails this weekend to its millions of customers, reminding them to use multifactor authentication, which requires users to verify their identity by entering a code that they receive as a text message or by using an authentication application, in addition to their password.

“Unfortunately, when the same user name and password is reused on multiple services, it’s possible for bad actors to gain access to many accounts,” the statement said.

A spokesman for the Jackson, Miss., field office of the F.B.I. said he could not confirm or deny that the episode was being investigated. The Southaven police chief, Macon Moore, said on Monday that the case was under investigation, but would not comment further because the investigation was active. He also said that the police had not received other reports.

Cybersecurity experts said it’s not that difficult for hackers to gain access to “internet of things” devices, which include Ring security cameras and voice assistants, such as Alexa and Google Home.

“Unfortunately, we’re so reliant on passwords at this point, but passwords are absolutely the weakest link,” said Tim Weber, security services director for ADNET Technologies in Farmington, Conn.","“Our security team has investigated this incident and we have no evidence of an unauthorized intrusion or compromise of Ring’s systems or network,” the statement said.

Editor’s note: This article will be continually updated throughout the COVID-19 outbreak and will remain in alphabetical order. Please email elena@foodtank.com if you would like to add an opportunity to our running list.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus, has disrupted most of the world in recent weeks. People are staying home from work, schools and colleges are moving online, and restaurants in many cities and states are mandated to serve eaters via takeout or delivery only. Farmers markets are closing or not opening at all. And, unfortunately, some cafes, bars, and kitchens have closed entirely. Food service workers—from chefs and line cooks to wait staff and dishwashers—are on the front lines of both the health and economic impacts of this disease.

But thankfully, in response, advocates around the country and around the world are gathering community support—and if you’re able, you can help too. These organizations are welcoming donations of food, money, and volunteer hours to aid restaurants, service workers, farmers, and people going hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. ALONE Ireland

With people self-isolating to prevent COVID-19 infections, senior citizens—already particularly vulnerable to the disease—may feel lonelier with limited social contact. ALONE is an Irish organization that recruits volunteers to call, visit, and befriend elderly people living at home. In response to COVID-19, they are looking for more volunteers to offer telephone support, by kindly checking in on those over 60, and practical support, by running errands like grocery shopping and pharmacy pickups. They have also launched a national helpline to answer questions and offer reassurance. People around the world are welcome to donate, and those living in Ireland can volunteer here.

2. ATL Family Meal

As a collaboration of more than 200 restaurants and businesses in the Atlanta area, ATL Family Meal delivers meals to hospitality workers who are facing either unemployment or hunger due to COVID-19. ATL Family Meal has delivered more than 15,000 meals during the pandemic. The initiative’s meal delivery network includes Butcher & Brew, Holeman & Finch, Empire State South, and more. Plus, Wild Heaven Beer, a local craft beer brewery, has created two new beers to support ATL Family Meal and is donating a portion of proceeds to the initiative.

3. Big Table

Operating in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and San Diego, California, Big Table cares for restaurant workers experiencing hardship, poverty, addiction, legal trouble, and more—all of which can be magnified by crises like COVID-19. Big Table works on a referral model, so rather than requiring a person in crisis to ask, Big Table allows a fellow employee or manager to submit a personal referral. You can donate online, or care for vulnerable members of your own community by taking on one of Big Table’s creative support ideas. If you are a food service worker and know someone in crisis, refer them here.

4. Boston Cares

A central hub for volunteering, Boston Cares helps more than 25,000 people annually give back to schools, nonprofit agencies, and other community programs. They recruit, train, and mobilize volunteers across the Greater Boston area. As many civic organizations adjust their programming models in response to COVID-19, Boston Cares is seeking volunteers to help the community. Boston Cares offers a virtual volunteer orientation program so people can begin to help others while maintaining their social distancing.

5. California Food Policy Advocates

With offices in Oakland, Los Angeles, and San Diego, California Food Policy Advocates (CFPA) pushes policy solutions to help low-income people across the state access healthy food. CFPA supported and will help implement national COVID-19 response programs in California, including those enacted by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. CFPA is also using its email newsletter as a way to keep the community informed about advocacy opportunities and policy responses to the coronavirus. You can donate here.

6. Chef Ann Foundation

The Chef Ann Foundation is a Colorado-based nonprofit helping schools around the country serve kids healthier, tastier, scratch-made lunches. As schools respond to coronavirus-related closures, the Chef Ann Foundation is sharing successful tactics and best practices from their partner districts. They’re working to make it as easy as possible to develop remote food programs and other support for students. In addition to accepting donations, the Chef Ann Foundation is also collecting messages for a nationwide Thank You card for school food workers across America.

7. Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE)

Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE) offers support to families of food and beverage service workers facing serious challenges, from serious illness and death to injury or eviction. CORE grants help families with everything they need to weather tough times — medical bills, gas, groceries, clothing, utilities, rent, and more. Since 2004, CORE has supported more than 600 families and raised over $4 million. Currently, CORE is setting aside grants specifically for families of restaurant employees who have tested positive for COVID-19.

8. City Harvest

As restaurants closed and events were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, much of the food that would have been served did not go to waste, thanks to City Harvest. The New York City-based food rescue organization received 50,000 pounds of donated food last week — five times their normal intake — and distributed it to food pantries, soup kitchens, and directly to families in need. Monetary donations to City Harvest will help provide more shelf-stable food relief to people in need and ensure their delivery schedule can meet the increased need.

9. Dining at a Distance

Dining at a Distance, created specifically to support food providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers dozens of local, community-sourced databases of farms and restaurants that remain open for business. Residents of nearly 50 cities of all sizes around the globe, from Berlin to Boston to Corinth, Mississippi, can find contact information for restaurants, takeout and delivery details, and comments from community members. Dining at a Distance also offers databases of farms in all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C., broken down by crop type, organic certification, and how consumers can pick up or receive fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, and more. You can get involved by adding restaurants and farms to the database or starting a new database if your city isn’t listed.

10. Family Agriculture Resource Management Services (F.A.R.M.S.)

Recognizing the systemic challenges and discrimination Black farmers face in the United States, attorney Jillian Hishaw founded Family Agriculture Resource Management Services. F.A.R.M.S. provides legal assistance to farmers with limited resources and helps them retain control and ownership of their land. The Farmers Emergency Fund, which is open to small rural farmers, but not farm employees, is aimed at making sure aging farmers and those from historically disadvantaged groups can stay afloat during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Stipends are limited to $500.

11. The Farmer Fund

Although The Farmer Fund was initially founded to help Georgia farmers facing destruction from natural disasters, “we have seen over the past few days that a pandemic like COVID-19 is its own natural disaster — and is certainly an emergency,” they write. The Farmer Fund, now run by Georgia Organics, has raised over US$50,000 to support farmers in the state since 2018. Now, donations to the fund will help farmers survive the pandemic, rebuild, and continue feeding Georgians through markets, CSAs, and restaurant sales.

12. Farmworker Justice

Through legal advocacy in government, regulatory agencies, and in the court system, Farmworker Justice aims to secure legal rights for agricultural workers and improve their working conditions. With dedicated attorneys on staff, Farmworker Justice represents agricultural workers in lawsuits and regulatory petitions. At the same time, they educate both policymakers and the public about the challenges they face. “All of these workers are in perilous situations and being given absolutely no respect in the narrative of COVID-19,” food activist and journalist Raj Patel told me on Food Talk with Dani Nierenberg.”

13. Feed the Front Line NOLA

In three steps, Feed the Front Line supports restaurants, musicians and artists, and hospital workers caring for those impacted by COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana. First, every donation goes toward ordering meals from local restaurants for ER shift crews. Second, local musicians and artists who have lost out on gigs are hired to pick up the food and deliver it to a local hospital. Third, the talented deliverers drop off the food with a side of morale-boosting “food love.” During the last week of March, Feed the Front Line NOLA fed 1,200 hospital workers with 35 deliveries, putting $10,000 toward local restaurants, musicians, and artists. On Saturday, April 4, alone, they served 1,800 meals. If you want to “send food love,” you can donate online.

14. Float Small Business & Portland Community SOS

Float Small Business and Portland Community SOS are two initiatives in Portland, OR, with similar missions: encouraging community members to support local businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Float Small Business has pages devoted to restaurants & bars, cafes, and grocers & specialty shops, with links to support funds so you can give money directly to restaurants struggling to survive. Portland Community SOS is focused on gift cards, and offers links to the websites of restaurants and cafes that offer them. Portland Community SOS also offers a page of resources for business owners.

15. Food Chain Workers Alliance

By uniting worker-based organizations into a broad coalition, the Food Chain Workers Alliance (FCWA) stands up for more than 375,000 workers who “plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, [by] organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain.” In a survey, the Food Chain Workers Alliance found that 80 percent of all food workers were not given paid sick days, and 43 percent said they feared they would lose their job if they took a sick day. In response to the dangers of COVID-19, the Food Chain Workers Alliance is fighting for the health and safety of workers, fair wages and working conditions, and support for street vendors and undocumented immigrants.

16. Food Recovery Network

Since its inception in 2011, Food Recovery Network has rescued more than 3.2 million pounds of food and has a presence on 230 college campuses across the United States. Food Recovery Network empowers students, communities, and food businesses to reconstruct their perceptions and habits around surplus food. To support businesses making difficult choices in closing or paring down operations, FRN has created a four-step COVID-19 Food Recovery Guide to make donating excess food as simple as possible.

17. Frontline Foods

Hospital workers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, often working day and night treating patients. Meanwhile, local restaurants are struggling financially. Frontline Foods aims to address both issues: With donations processed through Chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen, Frontline Foods pays local restaurants to cook and deliver meals to hospital workers in their community. With 28 chapters in 21 U.S. states, Frontline Foods has raised over US$1 million and delivered more than 7,000 meals during the COVID-19 outbreak. You can donate through World Central Kitchen here or sign up as a volunteer.

18. Gift Card Army

Based in Portland, OR, Gift Card Army offers a searchable directory of local restaurants, cafes, bars, and other retail shops that remain open for delivery, takeout, or—as the name suggests—gift cards, which can help a small business stay afloat during COVID-19 even if they suspend kitchen operations. Gift Card Army allows you to search for restaurants in the Portland area geographically as well, and a map-based search function is under development. If you operate a small business, you can enter your info into the search engine here.

19. Good Farmer Fund

A project of the Seattle Neighborhood Farmers Markets, the Good Farmer Fund assists small and new farms facing any sort of crisis—extreme weather, fire, equipment damage, flood, predators, and more. Margins for farms can be razor-thin, and the Good Farmer Fund has given more than US$280,000 to over 80 farms since 2008 to help them land on their feet. As markets shut down and demand drops due to COVID-19, the Good Farmer Fund will be issuing several round of grants over the next few months. They accept donations to the fund and applications for grants on their website.

20. Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen

Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen is New York City’s largest emergency food-relief organization. In addition to their soup kitchen, their Backpack Pantry Program helps ensure that school-aged kids in NYC—one in ten of whom lived in a homeless shelter at some point last year—have food to eat. Recently, Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen launched the Coronavirus Hot Meal Distribution Campaign, which has raised over US$28,000 of its US$1 million goal to provide hot meals to New York City residents in need.

21. Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center

The Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center develops intersectoral, innovative, and evidence-based solutions to prevent diet-related diseases and promote food security in New York City and other urban centers. The Center works with policymakers, community organizations, advocates, and the public to create healthier, more sustainable food environments and use food to promote community and economic development. The Center is currently working to release Coronavirus NYC Food Resource Guides for each of NYC’s 59 neighborhoods with the following information: meals for children, meals for seniors, retail food stores and their delivery/benefits policies, local food pantries and soup kitchens, resources for homeless people, resources for immigrant populations, and resources for people with disabilities.

22. Italian Red Cross

Italy has been particularly affected by the coronavirus, with more COVID-19 cases and deaths than almost any other country. The Italian Red Cross (CRI) is working with the Italian Ministry of Health to manage the country’s response. CRI is helping set up special treatment structures and transporting potentially infected patients using biocontaminant vehicles. Additionally, they are supplying regional Italian Red Cross committees with testing and treatment materials. People around the world can donate to support the Italian Red Cross’ efforts, and if you live in Italy, you can sign up and train to volunteer online.

23. James Beard Foundation

The James Beard Foundation’s mission is to celebrate America’s food culture. At a time when restaurants, bars, and other independent food and beverage operations are facing temporary closures and reduced capacity, their futures may feel uncertain.

31. One Fair Wage

Advocates at One Fair Wage are working to end the tipped minimum wage, a practice in the U.S. that allows employers to pay workers significantly less than the legal minimum wage if they also earn tips. With many restaurants across the country closing or reducing service—and sectors such as ridesharing and nail/hair salons also significantly affected—One Fair Wage has launched an Emergency Coronavirus Tipped and Service Worker Support Fund. This effort will provide restaurant workers, Lyft/Uber drivers, and other tipped wage-earners with money they need for basic expenses, like food and rent.

32. The Power of 10

A new initiative that launched in response to COVID-19, The Power of 10 is a “restaurant revitalization plan” conceived by chef Erik Bruner-Yang. The Power of 10 aims to use one donation to fund restaurants, support employees, and feed food-insecure communities for free. If a restaurant could receive a $10,000 donation, it could re-employ 10 full-time staff and serve 1,000 free meals — hence, the power of 10. The initiative is being piloted at three restaurants in Washington, D.C.: Cane, ABC Pony, and Maketto, which is helmed by Bruner-Yang. The model is coming to Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, and is scalable for any size community across the country. You can make donations in amounts that are, appropriately, powers of 10, starting at US$10.

33. Philly Restaurant Relief & Server Relief Fund

Restaurants in Philadelphia, like in many cities across the world, are subject to restrictions on dining-in due to COVID-19.

Philadelphia restaurant workers are also supported by the unrelated Philly Restaurant Server Relief Fund. This initiative aims to raise enough money to give servers $400 a week, the average they would otherwise earn, until at least the beginning of April.

Mon, 11/25/2019 - 16:42pm | By: Jenny Tate

Making spirits bright – along with filling bellies with food, homes with needed items, and hearts with joy – is part of the goal of University of Southern Mississippi (USM) Gulf Park campus students, faculty and staff each November through the annual Golden Basket project.

Led by USM Gulf Park students in the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) Club, the Thanksgiving Golden Basket project supports South Mississippi families who are among the least food secure on the coast. This year, 10 families were pre-screened and selected from the Bay-Waveland, Long Beach, and Harrison County school districts and the Jackson County Head Start.

Teams consisting of USM students, faculty and staff ‘adopt’ a family and provide all of the items for a Thanksgiving dinner, as well as holiday presents and other basic items for their designated family, such as furniture, clothing, shoes and personal hygiene items.

The project began in 2011, when a student in the USM social work program working at a local Head Start agency saw a need to provide a Thanksgiving meal to a family who lacked food security. In 2012, social work instructor Karen Aderer formalized the project, leading each of the four cohorts of students – pre-social work, juniors, seniors and master’s students, as well as the social work faculty – to each adopt a family. In 2017, Dr. Casey Maugh Funderburk, vice provost for the Gulf Park campus, helped expand the project campus-wide.

Aderer has also integrated the service project into a meaningful out of the classroom learning experience for her students.

“From an educational standpoint, this event represents the service learning component that we think is so important to offer to our students. It is one thing to learn about something in a book; it is quite another to have to go out and actually carry out the critical thinking and work involved,” said Aderer, who serves at the BSW Club advisor. “My social work students get real world experience in interviewing families and then acting as the liaisons between the family and the team that adopts them.”

Students had the opportunity to interview families selected for Golden Basket, giving students like Tiffany Cole valuable hands-on field experience. Cole, a senior Social Work major and President of the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) Club, helped lead this year’s Golden Basket project.

“I was the leader for the Bachelor of Social Work Club team. I made a lot of calls and going around to different companies simply asking for donations for the family. Advocacy is a big part of social work and it felt really good to really advocate for this family. I also had to stay in contact with the other officers of the BSW Club to make sure that all of the family’s needs were being supplied,” said Cole.

Families who are selected to receive Golden Baskets not only have food insecurity, but may have experienced a recent adverse life event such as loss of job, eviction or a house fire. They may also be behind on bills and/or lack reliable transportation.

Cole was also able to obtain that hands-on field experience by interviewing two of the 2019 Golden Basket families.

“I had the opportunity to interview two families selected for Golden Baskets this year. This interviewing process was a time for the family to discuss their needs and wants, but both of my families even wanted to discuss what led them to their situation,” said Cole.

“As a social work major, we learn about the Ecological Theory, that a person’s environment and surroundings have effects on that person. This actually brought what I learned in class into perspective, the ‘real world’ experience. After discussing the family’s situation, needs and wants, the family expressed their gratitude for all of the assistance,” she added.

In addition to acquiring hands-on field experience, Cole said the project made her step out of her comfort zone to ask for donations for her team’s family by reaching out to local businesses and individuals.

“I was able to communicate and reach out to different organizations and individuals to advocate for the family’s desires. This experience taught me that there are a lot of people in the world willing to assist, we just need to ask for the assistance,” said Cole.

Aderer attributes the success of the annual holiday event to working in a team environment.

“To pull off a philanthropic event like this, our faculty, staff and students have to pull together to plan, problem solve, assign tasks, divvy up donation seeking, and strategize set up and delivery. All of this is very team-building and ability-enhancing. It also shows our students the importance of giving back and helping to create a better community,” said Aderer.

As part of the annual project, Golden Basket items are gathered and staged in the Hardy Hall Ballroom on the Gulf Park campus, where participating teams displayed their items prior to delivery. Team members then deliver the items to the receiving family, meeting them for the very first time.

“When delivering these items and seeing the family become excited because of spatulas or wallets, it caused me to become more grateful of the things that I am blessed to have,” added Cole.","USM’s Gulf Park Campus Supports Coastal Families Through Golden BasketMon, 11/25/2019 - 16:42pm | By: Jenny TateMaking spirits bright – along with filling bellies with food, homes with needed items, and hearts with joy – is part of the goal of University of Southern Mississippi (USM) Gulf Park campus students, faculty and staff each November through the annual Golden Basket project.

81,81,"Sep 16, 2020",Mississippi Today,‘In the midst of crisis and struggle…there’s still hope’ — Q&A with Delta nonprofit director Chiquikta Shaw,"Chiquikta Fountain, a Mississippi Delta native, is the executive director for Delta Hands for Hope in Shaw, Mississippi which is also in the Mississippi Delta. Fountain has spearheaded the organization’s pivot from offering youth after school and summer programming to also becoming a designated emergency food pantry once the pandemic hit.

Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length.

Mississippi Today: What do you do as director for Delta Hands for Hope?

Chiquikta Fountain: Our organization is focused on youth. We do a lot around education. We do after school programming, we also offer summer camps. We also focus on health and nutrition. An example of that would be our summer feeding program. Right now we’re actually operating as an emergency food pantry because of COVID. So we’re using our background in working with kids in that area to ensure that they’re still getting access to meals until school starts. So pretty much whatever the community needs, we try to serve in that capacity, but our main focus is youth.

Mississippi Today: Do you see yourself as an advocate as well as a community leader?

Fountain: I do. My background was in advocacy, particularly in education advocacy before I took this job last year. So one of the things that I really wanted to do when I came into this position was find ways to use that skill set as a director. And I just think it worked hand-in-hand. We have access to so many resources and we need to be using those resources to empower our youth and how they see themselves. I want to help give them the tools that they need to learn how to navigate the world whether they choose to leave Shaw or to live here in Shaw, to show them that they can still make change. They can still bring impact and also help their families. There’s no way that we can focus all of our efforts on supporting youth and just disregard the family unit. So whatever it is that we can do to bridge that gap, we’re looking to do that as well.

Mississippi Today: How have you seen your role as a community leader and advocate evolved through this pandemic and social reckoning that we’re happening?

Fountain: Even — There’s still optimism. I want to use my position and my point of view to show that yes, these things are happening in our area. We were dealing with these things far before we even knew what coronavirus and COVID-19 was. But I want to use these opportunities to talk about the great people that we have in our community. One of the things that I have seen since we’ve been doing this, particularly around food security in this area and operating as a food pantry, is people coming to help. These young people are coming every day. Every day that we have something going on they are here and they are committed from the time they showed up until the last box of food was gone and the last gallon of milk was gone. They give so selflessly so I am just so happy to see that.

A lot of those seeds were sown in this community and into these children long before I got here. So I can’t take credit for that, but what I do feel like I bring to the table is giving them a space to show them how not only will this be something great for them to put on their resumé, but this is an act of kindness that we need to exercise more of. We never know a person’s situation and what they’re going through when they get home. But if we can do something in our actions to make someone else’s day brighter or to give them something to eat that they didn’t have earlier, let’s do that. And this is also an opportunity for you to be the type of person that you want to be. So we don’t want to just talk about what leadership should look like. We need to be setting those examples, providing spaces for them to actually see that in motion.

Mississippi Today: It sounds like the example that you want to provide for the youth is really shaping the way you’re thinking about yourself as a leader.

Fountain: Absolutely. When I first came into this position, I didn’t think that I was ready, even with having a teenager for a child myself. I really didn’t know what to expect or how I should go about trying to connect with these young people. It was like the more I started to settle into the job I just realized, ‘You’re really overthinking this.’ Because what I’ve been able to see in the past is a lot of older people who were neglected, who didn’t have someone to pull them aside instill love and support and understanding and confidence into them. So now I have an opportunity to not take the place of these children’s parents by any means, but I’m an extension of that home and I have a chance to forge those things.

There are so many kids who I see that people just disregard because of their last name, because of where they’re from because they’ve got behavior issues but you never know why. And just because they have that last name, that’s not a predictor of who they are. It doesn’t mean they can’t be great. So I’m really trying to see this new phase of leadership as a way for me to not make them be what I think that they should be, but help them to see what they can’t see. It could be an opportunity to say, ‘You don’t have to leave Shaw to be great. There are things you can do right here as a young person.’

I also think it’s important that people see the face of the so-called leader and not this person that is delegating responsibilities to volunteers. Because I could easily just say, ‘OK volunteers you guys handle all of this and I’m going to be up at the office.’ No, they need to see me out there dirty, dusty, sweating. They need to see that because that means that I’m invested. I’m not out here because I want a pat on the back but because I need you all to see that I’m a part of this.","Chiquikta Fountain, a Mississippi Delta native, is the executive director for Delta Hands for Hope in Shaw, Mississippi which is also in the Mississippi Delta.

82,82,"Jan 7, 2021",WJTV,Peco Foods closing three Mississippi locations,"CANTON, Miss. (WJTV) – Devastating news for poultry plant workers across Mississippi, with Peco foods announcing three locations will close their doors this year.

This came as a surprise to workers and leaders in the community. Now they are looking for new economic opportunities.

Peco Foods shutting down plants and hatcheries will not go unnoticed. In some of these locations, they’ve been operating for over 40 years employing thousands.

Keeping America’s food line active has been a challenge during the Coronavirus pandemic, but soon over 1,000 Mississippians won’t have a job as the fight against COVID-19 continues.

“It’s the economic loss of families and economic loss of individuals who have lost their jobs or will lose their jobs,” Mayor William Truly of Canton said. “They won’t be able to purchase services and goods for themselves or their families.”

In statements released Thursday morning company managers explained this is part of a “long-term strategic vision” to better align with customer needs and “economic conditions” plus adapt to “industry trends”.

“Because it’s equipped with what I believe is a cold storage facility a likely replacement would be another food distribution type facility,” Joey Deason, Executive Director of Madison County Economic Development Authority told us. “Those facilities are USDA approved and the Peco Corporation Owns about 58 acres there.”

There’s no specific timeline on when the Fulton St. plant in Canton, Brookfield, and Hatchery in Philadelphia will close. Mayor Truly heard it could begin by March and Company statements say these plans should be finalized by the Summer.

“We will work with other industries and other individuals to help these people find jobs,” Mayor Truly promised. “We don’t intend to sit back and not serve as a bridge helping the Peco employees.”

“We’ve already been reaching out to the Department of Employment Security, the Win Jobs Center, the Community College, PR firm with Peco as well,” Director Deason added. “It’s our hope that when Amazon plans on opening their facility in August who’s going to be hiring up to 1800 employees to coordinate and provide some opportunities to those as Peco.”

Still many are surprised with Peco Foods having to make these cutbacks after taking in over $1 billion in revenue in 2019 alone. Operating 21 different plants across three states shipping out almost $2 billion pounds of poultry annually has to make these cutbacks.

Peco Foods still plans to redirect resources to expand productivity and invest more in the companies West Point and Sebastopol facility to add operations.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Building on decades of successful collaborations, Mississippi State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service celebrated the new “Atlas” supercomputer Wednesday [Sept. 30] with a virtual event.

With funding from the USDA-ARS, the state-of-the-art system was installed recently at MSU’s High Performance Computing Collaboratory. The system contains 23,040 logical cores with 101 terabytes of total RAM, powering research advances in biocomputing, epidemiology, geospatial technology and more.

“All of us at Mississippi State are very proud of our longstanding partnership with ARS at Stoneville, as well as the ARS facilities and personnel who are on our main campus in Starkville,” MSU President Mark E. Keenum said. “And now, we are thrilled to have the Atlas supercomputer and ARS scientists in the Thad Cochran Research, Technology and Economic Development Park – the largest and most successful research park in the state. Co-locating MSU and ARS scientists creates a unique environment, where together, we can solve complex agriculture and food security problems.”

ARS is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s chief scientific in-house research agency, finding solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS Administrator Chavonda Jacobs-Young said the new partnership increases the computational compacity of SCINet, the organization’s platform for providing scientists access to high performance computer clusters.

“When we began considering how to expand SCINet, we knew Mississippi State University, with their impressive computing capabilities, and wealth of experience in modeling and analysis, would be a great partner,” Jacobs-Young said. “It was clear to us that we could once again align our research efforts with MSU and mutually expand our efforts and impact.”

MSU has been a consistent national leader in computing power and is currently home to the fourth most powerful academic data center in the U.S., Orion. In addition to the USDA, MSU’s high performance computing capabilities have led to critical partnerships and research opportunities with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; NASA; the National Science Foundation; U.S. departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Energy; among other state and federal agencies. The Mississippi Legislature provided funding during the 2020 session for the construction of a new high performance data center in the Cochran Research Park, which will further strengthen MSU’s capabilities and provide new economic opportunities for the state.

MSU is also a national leader in agriculture research, consistently ranking among the top 10 universities in the country for agriculture and natural resources research funding. During his tenure as MSU president, Keenum, a former Under Secretary for the USDA, has made global food security a primary focus area for university research efforts. The USDA-ARS is a close research partner of the university, with ARS and MSU scientists working together to solve agricultural production issues and spur new innovations.

As the agriculture sector continues to implement advances in technology, high performance computing capacity can help meet the demand for data analysis, creating more productive and efficient processes.

“There is limitless potential when combining high performance computing and world-class agriculture research and development,” said MSU Interim Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan. “With our strengths in these areas, MSU is well-positioned to remain at the forefront of the exciting advances that will help feed our growing global population in the decades to come. Working together with partners like the USDA-ARS, we can continue to make a tremendous impact at the state, national and global level.”

The state of Mississippi continues to develop substantial high performance computing capabilities. In addition to the facilities located at MSU, substantial computing systems are located at the Stennis Space Center on the Gulf Coast and the U. S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg. Mississippi’s supercomputing capacity currently ranks fifth in the country.

Posted Monday, December 28, 2020 4:47 pm

New Mexico performs well on access to health care but is falling short on food security and mental wellness, according to the recent household data in “Kids, Families and COVID-19: Pandemic Pain Points and a Roadmap for Recovery,” a 50-state report developed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF) analyzing how families are faring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A news release from the nonprofit New Mexico Voices for Children (NMVC) said the report, citing U.S. Census data, shows 20 percent of New Mexico households with children sometimes or often do not have enough to eat. Only one other state – Mississippi – has as high a rate, while the national average for food insecurity is 14 percent.

New Mexico also has the highest rate – 27 percent – of adults living in households with children who feel down, depressed or hopeless. Mississippi and Pennsylvania also have a rate of 27 percent in this category, while the national average is 21 percent, the report said.

New Mexico’s overall food insecurity rate increased from 15 percent in 2018 to an estimated 21 percent in 2020, NMVC said, based on the national nonprofit Feeding America’s “Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity” report. For Doña Ana County, the report showed overall food insecurity increased from 15.7 percent in 2018 to 21.3 percent in 2020, and child food insecurity increased from 25.8 to 35.8 percent during the same period.

The AECF report also looked at whether families believe they will be able to make their next rent or mortgage payment and if they have health insurance. In New Mexico, 18 percent of adults with children said they have slight or no confidence in being able to pay their rent or mortgage, which is the same as the national rate. Eleven percent do not have health insurance, which is better than the national rate of 12 percent.

An August 2020 report from WalletHub (https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-underprivileged-children/5403) showed New Mexico with the most underprivileged children per capita in the United States, and with the second highest rate of child food-insecurity. New Mexico was the fourth highest in children living in single-parent families and the second highest in percentage of children living in households with below-poverty income, WalletHub said.

Casa de Peregrinos emergency food program in Doña Ana County

“Food insecurity has been an issue in our county for some time now. Right now, the pandemic has put it in the spotlight,” said Lorenzo Alba, executive director of Casa de Peregrinos emergency food program.

Alba said food insecurity is much higher in some parts of Doña Ana County than others, with communities in the southern part of the county, including Sunland Park, Anapra, Santa Teresa, La Union and Chaparral dealing with the most serious food-insecurity issues.

“We are working on a project to distribute more food in the southern part of Doña Ana County,” Alba said. “We’re in this for the long haul. The pandemic will take a few years to recover from economically. We are planning for the worst to come in the next few months. We can always use monetary donations.”

Fifty dollars, he said, provides 300 meals at Casa de Peregrinos, while $100 feeds an average family for a month. Donations of any amount are welcome.

Las Cruces legislator: Diversify the state’s economy

Dealing with food security and mental health issues in New Mexico is “really about economic diversification and how we invest in our communities,” said state Rep. Angelica Rubio, D-Doña Ana, who is a professional community organizer.

“It’s really how we are actually looking at this from building a new economy for New Mexico,” Rubio said.

“With our volatile relationship with oil and gas and the ups and downs of that economy, it’s really put us in dire straits in terms of our ability to look ahead and plan ahead,” Rubio, who begins her fifth year in the New Mexico House of Representatives in January, said. “I feel like we operate from year to year, and that impacts our communities, especially our children.”

Reforming the state’s tax code is an important part of diversifying New Mexico’s economy, Rubio said, and that is “actively being done at the moment,” as individuals and organizations across the state talk to legislators about the issue.

Rubio said she has had nearly 200 conversations with people across the state to gather their thoughts and ideas about economic diversity.

“We always talk about it, but nobody does anything about it,” Rubio said. Now, however, “there are some of us trying to do something about it.”

People are “super excited” about the work that is going on to rebuild the state’s economy, she said.

It’s “exciting to hear,” Rubio said, “especially when folks have been feeling so hopeless around COVID and feeling like there’s no hope for small business. We are in position to re-imagine – and create – something different for ourselves.”

“I think there are a lot of opportunities,” she said. “We’ve just got to be bold and not be afraid to take some chances. Our kids, the next generation, are depending on it.”","Only one other state – Mississippi – has as high a rate, while the national average for food insecurity is 14 percent.

86,86,"Nov 13, 2019",Clemson University,"New Clemson program to improve health, economic outcomes through food-focused curriculum, research and products · Clemson News","CLEMSON — Clemson’s College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences has established a new program, Land-Grant Local, that will enhance economic, social and health outcomes in South Carolina by more fully integrating the work of local farms into Clemson University.

The program’s immediate goal is to factor foods from local farms into the Clemson environment, but college leadership and faculty are already shaping future curriculum and research centered on food systems that stress solutions for food insecurity and hunger across the state.

Leslie Hossfeld is dean of Clemson’s College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences.

Leslie Hossfeld, dean of the College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences, said the program is a logical next step for the college after its involvement in events centered on food research, such as 2019’s FoodFORWARD research symposium, and its broader efforts in the area of rural health outreach. Hossfeld said the benefits of taking advantage of farms in close proximity to Clemson go far beyond the tastebuds.

“Improving access to local foods has an immediate effect on health, but it also helps to stimulate the South Carolina economy, build relationships across communities and introduce a model that other areas can emulate,” Hossfeld said. “Pursuing a program such as Land-Grant Local further positions us as a 21st century land-grant college dedicated to teaching, research and service to the state.”

A program of this type is not a first for Hossfeld, who previously served as director of the Mississippi Food Insecurity Program and associate director of the Myrlie Evers-Williams Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities during her time as professor and head of the sociology department at Mississippi State University. At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Hossfeld started the Southeastern North Carolina Food Systems Program. The program created a food hub for local, socially disadvantaged farmers and linked farm to institution and throughout UNCW’s Campus Dining.

Hossfeld said one of her primary goals upon arriving at Clemson was to create a program aimed at food insecurity and food systems research.

“I know how much work goes into getting a program such as this one off the ground,” Hossfeld said. “It takes years of relationship building so that every farmer, faculty member, student and community member involved can come together and get the most out of the program.”

Mike McGirr will serve as director of Land-Grant Local for the College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences.

Hossfeld said the appointment of Mike McGirr as director of Land-Grant Local allows the college to skip many steps in the relationship-building needed for the role. McGirr previously served as executive director of Feed & Seed, a nonprofit collaborative organization seeking to increase food security for all South Carolinians.

As the director of Land-Grant Local, McGirr will work directly with Hossfeld and partner with Clemson’s College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences and other entities to develop, nurture and create food systems initiatives at the university. McGirr will bring together an interdisciplinary service-learning, facilities and community-programmatic team focused on food systems.

“I know Clemson just as well as I know the farmers and the consumers that exist in and around it,” McGirr said. “I’ve been engaged for years in measuring the need for local foods in the region as well as measuring the institutional and infrastructure gaps in the system that keep us from having local foods in a profitable and sustainable fashion.”

McGirr said that in the short term, he plans to focus on the “low-hanging fruit, dairy, meat and vegetable products” that can be easily factored into Clemson’s campus. Throughout this process, McGirr will work with Clemson faculty to research the economic, social, communication and health factors that will allow the college to make the case that local food sourcing can and should continue.

“Farmers don’t just grow stuff in the hopes it will sell,” McGirr said. “What I can bring to them is the mechanism to wash, sort, pack and label it to get it into the hands of an institution, and we want to build that to the specifications of Clemson. We want to program exactly what an institution the scale of Clemson University would like to purchase on a seasonal basis from farmers.”

According to Hossfeld, the real power of the program will come from students seeing it in action across the campus while attending classes and engaging in research that illuminate the bigger picture of food systems in the state. Hossfeld said if it can be done at Clemson, it can be scaled and accomplished in communities hit hardest by food insecurity and lack of access to healthy foods.

“Our vision is a fully integrated food system that exists across the university that can act as a model for other universities and communities across the state and beyond,” Hossfeld said. “We’re partnering with anyone who can bring their expertise in food systems to the table. When we pull our resources together, we can reduce waste, increase economic benefits, improve health outcomes and address hunger while creating and enhancing student learning, teaching and research.”

Media Contact: Lori Fogleman, Baylor University Media and Public Relations, 254-709-5959

Follow us on Twitter: @BaylorUMedia

WACO, Texas (May 5, 2020) – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced a major expansion of Meals-to-You, an innovative partnership between the Baylor University Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, USDA, McLane Global and PepsiCo, to feed low-income kids in rural areas. The initiative will serve nearly 5 million meals per week to rural children impacted by COVID-19-related school closures – five times its original goal.

“We are grateful to be a part of an innovative team made up of both the public and private sectors motivated by the strong desire to help our neighbors in need,” said Jeremy Everett, executive director of the Baylor University Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty. “We hope that the boxes of food will nourish children and communicate to their families that they are not in this tough circumstance alone.”

Initially, Meals-to-You aimed to deliver nearly 1 million meals per week to students eligible for free and reduced-price meals in a limited number of rural schools closed due to COVID-19, but that goal has been quickly surpassed. Meals-to-You has already shipped nearly 3.5 million meals to the homes of children in 12 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

In the last few weeks, 23 additional states and Puerto Rico have requested to participate in Meals-to-You, so the partnership is now quickly ramping up to serve 5 million meals per week to help meet growing demand. With the initial weeks of the program having been a huge success, USDA worked closely with partners to substantially increase capacity. Thirteen of those states are approved and have families either enrolling or in the final stages of verification, while 10 additional states have recently started the application process.

The Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty continues to work closely with states interested in the initiative and can now add more states to the program to meet continued demand. In addition, the Meals-to-You expansion will include a research component led by Baylor researchers, who will study family’s responses to the COVID-19 crisis and the potential impact of Meals-to-You.

“With this award, Baylor University is advancing research that sheds light on the economic implications of the coronavirus outbreak,” said Kathy Krey, Ph.D., director of research and administration of the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty. “We are evaluating the challenges and successes of the Meals-to-You program and how it impacts families’ food security.”

Meals-to-You boxes contain 20 nutritious meals – 10 breakfasts and 10 lunches – to cover the meals children would normally receive at school over two school weeks. Foods contained in the boxes meet USDA’s Summer Food Service Program meal standards and may include items like milk, fruit cups, cereal, whole-grain crackers and chili. Boxes are delivered directly to children’s doorsteps via the U.S. Postal Service and other delivery services.

USDA is hearing directly from families about how much this program means to them.

“I just wanted to say ‘An Unmeasurable Amount of Thank You’s’ are being sent to you and the entire teams it took to coordinate, prepare, and distribute these meals across my community,” said a mother from rural Texas. “I sincerely appreciate the incredible amount of effort it took for this to happen and I’m indebted to you and your teams! Thank you for making a difference in my household without even knowing who I am (we’re a family of 5 with one parent working with reduced wages).”

“Uncertain and difficult times call for unprecedented actions and big picture ideas. Rural children affected by school closures faced food insecurity, but these great American groups and companies stepped up to help their fellow countrymen by delivering boxes of food across the country,” Secretary Perdue said. “This program has been so successful and faced such high demand that we are expanding to 5 million meals a week. Our partnership to feed kids embodies President Trump’s whole of America approach to tackling the coronavirus by utilizing the best of America – private sector ingenuity with public sector backing.”

“This USDA-funded program has been a lifeline to thousands of students across rural America that would otherwise go hungry during this challenging period,” said Denton McLane, chairman of McLane Global. “We’ve shifted to a 24-hour production schedule across all locations to meet the demand, and couldn’t be prouder of our partners, employees and the people on the ground working to ensure these meals get to those who need it most.”

“We’re proud to partner with the USDA and Baylor to deliver meals directly to students who need them now more than ever,” said Matt Smith, senior director of Food for Good at PepsiCo. “Since 2009, we’ve been operating a U.S. nutrition program within PepsiCo called Food for Good that has delivered more than 30 million nutritious meals to children through afterschool and summer programs. In this time when millions of children are affected by school closures, it is a privilege to bring our scale and experience to this innovative partnership to serve our neighbors in need nationwide.”

USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) continues to provide additional options and flexibilities to feed children during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some examples include:

Issuing 21 nationwide waivers for child nutrition programs to allow for innovative methods of meal service and distribution during this unprecedented crisis pandemic;

for child nutrition programs to allow for innovative methods of meal service and distribution during this unprecedented crisis pandemic; Launching the Meals 4 Kids site finder in both English and Spanish to help families across America find free meals for kids during the public health emergency; and

in both English and Spanish to help families across America find free meals for kids during the public health emergency; and Approving Pandemic-EBT in 19 states, which provides food assistance to families of children eligible for free or reduced-price meals dealing with school closures.

To learn more about FNS’s response to COVID-19, visit www.fns.usda.gov/coronavirus and follow on Twitter at @USDANutrition.

FNS administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that leverage American’s agricultural abundance to ensure children and low-income individuals and families have nutritious food to eat. FNS also co-develops the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which provide science-based nutrition recommendations and serve as the cornerstone of federal nutrition policy.

PepsiCo and McLane Global have been selected as the private sector partners in support of this initiative. PepsiCo generously provided $1 million in funding to the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty to support school districts and to identify the children most in need. McLane Global will continue its participation from the initial pilot of the program. Both companies have provided prior philanthropic support to hunger initiatives and Baylor University. Drayton McLane Jr., chairman of the McLane Group, serves on the Baylor University Board of Regents as Regent Emeritus and chair of Regent Emeriti. Baylor University also holds a comprehensive contract with PepsiCo for beverage pouring and representation rights on campus.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—For Mississippi State’s internationally known cotton expert Raja Reddy, the accolades continue as he joins the likes of Thomas Edison and two Nobel laureates as fellow of the world’s largest multidisciplinary scientific society.

The Council of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, or AAAS, also recognized as publisher of the Science family of scholarly journals, places Reddy in a prestigious class of only 21 fellows across the nation being honored in the organization’s section on agriculture, food and renewable resources. The research professor in MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences enters a group of nearly 500 AAAS Fellows elected this year across 24 multidisciplinary sections combined.

A faculty member in the CALS Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, Reddy’s honor is for his contributions to the field of environmental plant physiology and agricultural systems modeling and applications. The 32-year MSU veteran also is director of the university’s Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research, or SPAR, unit and a scientist in the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station.

“I feel very honored to be elected as an AAAS Fellow. This honor reflects on many talented students, post-docs, visiting scientists and colleagues who worked in our laboratory over the years, addressing a multitude of environmental issues related to global food security and more,” Reddy said.

During his tenure at the university, he’s mentored countless undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral associates and visiting scientists alike, with an emphasis on promoting diversity and fostering global collaboration. Resulting in 300 publications, including peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, Reddy’s research on crop stress physiology, crop modeling and remote sensing focuses on the effects of climate change on crop physiology, growth and development. His work has resulted in improved quality of crops that feed, clothe and fuel the world.

Just this year, Reddy also was honored as the Researcher of the Year by the International Cotton Advisory Committee and received the Contribution to Science Award by the Mississippi Academy of Sciences. He has received several other noteworthy awards for his research, teaching and service activities, including MSU’s Ralph E. Powe Research Excellence Award, the Southeastern Conference Faculty Achievement Award and the National Cotton Council’s Outstanding Research Award in Cotton Physiology. He is a fellow of the American Society of Agronomy and the Crop Science Society of America.

As current president of the Mississippi Academy of Sciences, Reddy has focused on furthering the state’s conversation on science, engineering and technology, including agriculture, while facilitating new opportunities for students by developing a junior academy platform for K-12 students to engage with the organization.

Reuben Moore, interim vice president of MSU’s Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine and interim director of the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, spoke about Reddy’s commitment to the scientific community at large and his research in the field of crop physiology.

“Dr. Reddy’s work to address environmental stress on crops that are needed to feed and clothe the world is cutting-edge and relevant in our growing population,” Moore said. “Dr. Reddy embodies the land-grant mission with his work to advance science and make new discoveries, train the next generation of leaders and serve his profession and community. He is most deserving of this honor and the other accolades he has received this year.”

Struggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloat

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state's food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a long-standing initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

""All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,"" said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. ""When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.""

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don't have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic's early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

""If food banks can't take more product (from the California program), farmers are going to go out of business,"" Linkhart said. ""That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.""

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

""That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,"" said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. ""It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.""

Raudabaugh said the state's dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers' distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don't make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

""We're providing many hundreds of percents more (to food banks) than pre-pandemic,"" Raudabaugh said. ""Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these (partnerships). It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.""

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

""The money has to be there to justify the harvest,"" Michael said, ""and this solves some of that problem.""

On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen's small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers' pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

""It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,"" Van Laanen said. ""It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.""

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he's already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi's Farm stay afloat.

""It was really timely,"" Chichester said. ""It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early time frame.""

Karen Affeld, the development group's executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

""Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,"" she said. ""That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.""

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state's Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California's that launched in 2014.

It's a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they're harvesting crops bound for food banks.

""Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,"" said David Bobanick, the group's executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another 4 pounds are donated by farmers.

""Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,"" he said. ""It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.""

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

""Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,"" said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets' food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she's heard from parents who couldn't otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture _ known as CSA _ in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program's website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

""You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,"" said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. ""People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.""

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

""We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,"" Lebeaux said. ""Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.""

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

""We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,"" said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. ""One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.""

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

""If there's one silver lining,"" she said, ""it's that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.""","Farmers and food banksStruggling farmers work with overwhelmed food banks to stay afloatAs the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers.

91,91,"Jan 13, 2020",,Bully’s Closet and Pantry aims to meet several needs at MSU,"STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.

“We’re going to get more on Monday,” Clarke said. “You’re fine.”

All the milk was gone by Friday evening at Bully’s Closet and Pantry, a one-stop shop for food, professional clothing, school supplies and hygiene products for Mississippi State University students. It opened with a ribbon-cutting Friday morning and started distributing supplies that afternoon.

The shelves were lined with canned fruits and vegetables, beans and soup, boxes of cereal, Kleenex, personal items such as razors and deodorant and much more. Frozen meals and perishables such as milk and eggs were kept in the freezer and fridge, with a list on a white board keeping track of them.

School supplies such as pens and notebooks fill another set of shelves, and the next room in the small Morgan Avenue building contains racks lined with professional clothing, including blazers, for students to use as needed for job interviews. The building was formerly used for faculty housing, and BCP acquired the space in September 2018.

About 30 percent of college students nationwide struggle with food insecurity, so BCP will serve as “one more layer of support” for those students, MSU Vice President of Student Affairs Regina Hyatt told The Dispatch.

“We hope (the pantry) can alleviate, for the students that are most in need, some of the stress that they experience in not knowing where their next meal is coming from,” she said.

The pantry will be open from 1 to 6 p.m. on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. Students can come in once a week, and BCP provides a makeshift grocery list so they can feel like they are actually shopping, said Clarke, one of BCP’s three graduate assistant staff members.

There was “a good rush” of students when the doors first opened, Clarke said, but by 3 p.m. the shop was empty, most likely due to the stormy weather.

Hackett and Dominique Williams, both juniors, came in around 4:30 despite the downpour and filled a bag with canned soup, beans, apple juice and paper towels, among other things. When Hackett picked up bread and peanut butter and asked for jelly, Clarke made sure he and Williams were OK with the only available flavor, grape, before handing them a jar.

A group effort

Mayah Emerson knew that other Southeastern Conference universities had professional clothes closets, she said, so she included the idea in her platform when she successfully ran for president of the Mississippi State University Student Association in the spring semester of 2018.

“Students were asking about places to access professional clothing, so we really just saw it as meeting a need,” Emerson said.

The idea expanded to include a food pantry when the Office of Student Affairs got involved, she said, and her successor, current SA president Jake Manning, continued her work with the university to bring BCP to life.

Over about 18 months, BCP amassed 900 cans of vegetables, 400 cans of fruit and more than 1,000 toothbrushes and tubes of toothpaste, to name a few, said Montelleo Hobley, behavioral intervention team coordinator in the MSU Dean of Students’ Office.

A wide variety of student organizations and campus departments worked to stock the pantry, including MSU Athletics, which held drives at several football games and offered free tickets to two basketball games in exchange for donations, Hyatt said. MSU Police Chief Vance Rice asked every officer in the department to fill a box with supplies, and they did, Hyatt said.

BCP collected tax-deductible monetary donations through the MSU Foundation, which will continue to identify and pursue donors, and student organizations will help by holding food and supply drives, Hyatt said.

MSU President Mark Keenum had three words for Hyatt when she approached him with the idea for BCP: “Make it happen.”

“When we think about people who are in need of food, we tend to think about people in far-off, distant lands, but we have people in need right here in our own community, right here on our campus,” Keenum told a crowd of about 50 at Friday’s press conference.

BCP is the newest addition to MSU’s Food Security Network, which includes the Block by Block program for students to donate part of their meal plan to other students and the Maroon Meals alert system for the location and availability of food on campus.

Block by Block currently serves between 200 and 300 students, with participation increasing in recent years, Hyatt said. Faculty in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition are conducting research that will hopefully shed more light on how prevalent food insecurity is on the MSU campus, she said.

BCP will remain stocked with food items thanks to partnerships with the United Way of Central Mississippi and the Hattiesburg-based nonprofit Extra Table, as well as student and faculty donations, Hyatt said. The donation boxes in the back of the building saw several contributions Friday, Clarke said.

The staff is open to feedback on what students need that BCP does not yet have, such as shoes and a section for baby supplies. Hackett asked the staff for salt and pepper, and Clarke put it on the list of items to add.

After filling their bag, Hackett and Williams hoped to catch a bus in order to stay out of the rain on their way out of BCP Friday afternoon. Hackett, a first-semester transfer student from Hinds Community College in Raymond, said he is grateful for the pantry’s help but hopes he does not find himself using it often.

“I know there are more disadvantaged people than I am,” he said.","STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.

When university presidents were surveyed in spring of 2020 about what they felt were the most pressing concerns of COVID-19, college students going hungry didn't rank very high.

Why It Matters This is not just a matter of growling stomachs. This is a straight-up education and health issue. When students don't really know if they'll be able to get enough to eat, it can lead to a series of problems that make it harder to stay in school. For instance, it can affect academic performance and sleep quality. It can also lead to poor mental and physical health outcomes for college students. Food insecurity can also result in disrupted eating patterns if there is not enough food or the variety or quality of what someone eats is low.

Campus Food Pantries Previous strategies by colleges and universities to fight hunger in their student bodies have varied widely. They include campus food pantries, emergency cash assistance and nutrition education through noncredit classes or workshopse. These strategies were put to the test during the spring 2020 semester, when nearly three in five students said they had trouble meeting their own basic needs during the pandemic. College food pantries saw big increases in demand. Others said they were getting less donated food. This made it even harder to meet the rising food needs of students. Campus food pantries largely rely on local or regional food banks, which have been dealing with greater demand than they are able to meet during the pandemic. The many students who are attending college remotely will, of course, have less access to campus resources like food pantries.

Federal Help Other potential ways to get more food are government programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Yet the majority of able-bodied students are not eligible. Long-standing restrictions, like the college SNAP rule, prevent full-time students from receiving these benefits. Such regulatory hurdles were created under the assumption that most students can rely on their parents to get enough to eat. However, college students have vastly different levels of financial support. Some students can rely on their parents for everything and others cannot rely on their parents for anything. Decreased reliance on parental financial support is especially common for first-generation students and students of color, who now make up 45% of enrolled college students. Under normal circumstances, many college students might rely on part-time jobs to pay for their food.

Two-thirds of the students who were employed before the pandemic said that job insecurity was a problem for them, according to the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice #RealCollege survey. As the number of jobless young Americans remains elevated, unemployment and underemployment remain a problem. Jobless students face a potential double threat of less money for food and unemployment benefits cutting off their access to SNAP because the program requires most students to work at least part time. Attempts have been made at both the federal and state levels to meet the basic food needs of college students. Lawmakers have focused on temporarily suspending eligibility requirements or expanding the criteria for participating in nutrition assistance programs. Seventeen bills aiming to address food insecurity among college students were introduced to Congress during the 2019-2020 legislative session. However, these proposals failed to gain momentum, and the four COVID-19 stimulus bills to date have not addressed the hunger needs of college students. Notably, some students were ineligible to personally receive a CARES Act stimulus relief payment because they were claimed as dependents by their parents.

Short-Term Solutions Universities and colleges can make it a priority to ensure students are aware of all available campus resources and services. They can also potentially help students apply for federal assistance benefits. Campus food pantries are not a fully effective and efficacious solution for the scale of college food insecurity, but they can be a good interim solution to increase access to food for students. Campuses without food pantries can start one, making use of resources the College and University Food Bank Alliance provides. Schools with food pantries can try to get them to reach more students. Universities and colleges can also lean on one another for support. The Alabama Campus Coalition for Basic Needs is a great example of this. It brings together 10 universities across the state of Alabama collectively working to address student food insecurity.

93,93,"Nov 30, 2019",NBC News,Trump administration proposals could cause millions to lose food stamps,"Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

Over the past year, the Department of Agriculture proposed three changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. The new rules create stricter work requirements for program eligibility, cap deductions for utility allowances and “reform” the way 40 states automatically enroll families into SNAP when they receive other forms of federal aid.

A study by the Urban Institute released this week examined the three rules in combination for the first time and found that 3.7 million fewer people would receive SNAP in an average month, 2.2 million households would see their average monthly benefits drop by $127, more than 3 million others would see an average drop of $37 per month, and 982,000 students would lose access to free or reduced lunches.

“What we found is that overall the three proposed changes would reduce the number of households participating in SNAP by about 11 percent if this was implemented in 2018,"" said Laura Wheaton, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who conducted the study. ""It’s about a 9.4 percent reduction in the number of people participating and about an 8 percent reduction in overall benefits.”

Critics and experts say that would be antithetical to the program's goals to address food insecurity in the United States.

Craig Gundersen, an agricultural and consumer economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has studied the program for more than two decades, said that about a million people could become food-insecure because of the change. He added that 50 percent of those 3.7 million SNAP beneficiaries were already food insecure despite the assistance.

The changes, he said, would put many Americans in a worse position, increasing hunger and health issues. Each additional adult who becomes food-insecure sees an additional $2,000 in healthcare costs, Gundersen explained.

""The essential goal of the program is to mitigate hunger and its consequences in the United States,” he said. ""Anything that impedes SNAP of doing that is very problematic as it leads to food insecurity in our country.""

The USDA, meanwhile, estimates that the changes would reduce the SNAP budget by about $4.2 billion.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the work requirements in a USA Today column, emphasizing that it would save taxpayer dollars.

“At USDA, our informal motto is ‘Do Right and Feed Everyone,’” Perdue wrote. “With these proposed improvements, we will ‘do right’ by the taxpayers and restore the dignity of work to the able-bodied who receive SNAP benefits. And, we will ‘feed everyone’ by ensuring the health and stability of SNAP for those who truly need it.”

All of the new rules have gone through a comment period with the changes to utilities currently taking feedback until Monday. Tens of thousands of people have already responded, with most providing negative responses.

The latest rule change proposed by the Trump administration would cause millions of people to take smaller deductions for shelter and utility costs, which are considered when a person applies for SNAP benefits. Critics say that would force people to choose between buying food and paying for housing.

Gundersen said this change will prove to be a major cost for those living in metropolitan areas with high living costs.

It could also create a steeper financial cliff for some beneficiaries. Those in danger of losing access to SNAP might be discouraged from working because the new calculation would put them in a higher income bracket, causing them to lose access, Gundersen explained

“On the one hand they want to encourage people to work, but on the other they would be taking away that incentive,” Gundersen said.

But the main issue is that SNAP is not intended to be a work program in the first place, Gundersen said, but is instead intended to address food insecurity within the United States.

As it operates now, SNAP does not discourage people from participating in the labor market, he said.

""There are some assistance programs that do discourage people to work, but this is not one of them,"" Gundersen said, adding that what lawmakers should be asking is: ""What makes this program work so well and why does it work well as compared to other programs?""

These new rules also have advocates in states like Nevada worried. Nevada could see up to 22 percent of recipients lose access to food stamps, which could be devastating in a place where 12.3 percent of households face food insecurity, according to the USDA.

“SNAP is related to hunger and getting people the nutrition they need,” said Jocelyn Lantrip, the communications director at Food Bank of Northern Nevada. “Food shouldn’t be a luxury.”

With a tech boom raising income levels but not enough to cover rising housing costs, Lantrip said that these changes could create further food insecurity issues, which remain close to the levels that the Food Bank of Northern Nevada saw during the recession.

At the height of the recession, Lantrip said her food bank helped 103,000 people per month. Now, during a period of perceived economic stability, she said they are helping 91,000.

Food banks like hers wouldn’t be able to accommodate for the needs of an additional 196,000 people, which is the number in Nevada who would likely need help accessing food if these rules were to go into effect, Lantrip said.

“That’s really hard for food banks to keep up with if you have that kind of decline in benefits,” she said. “We support people if they fall outside of the safety net, but we can’t replace the safety net as a food bank. We’re spinning our wheels already, because when unemployment is low people assume hunger is low, but we’re just helping more working poor than before.”","Three proposed rule changes by the Trump administration could cause millions of poor people to lose access to food stamps and decrease the size of the benefit for millions more, a new study has found.

94,94,"Sep 14, 2020",,"Grants support expanded local food capacity, security","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Twenty-seven Illinois farmers were awarded a total of $250,000 in grants from the Illinois Stewardship Alliance’s Resilience Fund.

The Resilience Fund, with financial support from the Chicago Region Food System Fund, was designed to help farmers collaborate and invest in infrastructure to scale up their business models to meet skyrocketing demand for local food spurred by the pandemic.

“We received over 80 applications from local food producers requesting nearly $1 million in support,” said Liz Moran Stelk, Alliance Executive director.

“Farmers’ projects — to build walk-in coolers and packing sheds, construct hoop houses, install irrigation, to name a few — inspired us about farmers’ grit and determination to feed our communities.”

A diverse panel of a dozen agriculture and food specialists reviewed applications and selected Resilience Fund recipients who produce local food across Illinois.

Dan Lobbes at Green Earth Harvest Farm in Naperville will receive a $10,000 grant for a refrigeration unit.

“As we’ve had the third warmest summer on record, every day brings a worry about the patched together cooling system we have on the farm. We are so grateful for this opportunity to upgrade to something more dependable,” Lobbes said.

“What I thought might happen slowly over many years is suddenly a reality in the very near future,” Kacey Nelson of Two Million Blooms in Urbana said of her project to convert an old outbuilding into a dedicated honey house, which will help them streamline and scale up the business.

Jill Rendleman of All Seasons Farm in Cobden said she and the farm’s workers, interns and volunteers are excited to upgrade their packing shed with a cooling unit and insulation — their working environment will be much better.

“This grant will take us to another level of production in terms of both quality and quantity of organic produce,” Rendleman said.

For Down at the Farms, a 60-member farm collective in Central Illinois based in Fairbury, their $25,000 grant will support their pivot from restaurant sales to direct-to-consumer sales.

In the wake of the shelter in place order in March, farmer Marty Travis and his son, Will, who lead the Down at the Farms collective, lost 30 Chicago farm-to-table restaurant accounts overnight.

A new walk-in cooler and delivery truck will help the collective meet new consumer demand and sustain restaurant buyers who are starting to come back.

“The pandemic has changed the way we all think about food. We need local supply chains for food security into the future,” Travis said.

“It’s clear there is so much need for small and diverse farms to access resources. Local food producers make our communities more resilient and food secure in the face of future pandemics and climate crises,” Stelk said.

“COVID-19 has had an immense impact on farmers, particularly those who focus on selling their crops locally,” said Daniel Doyle, program officer for the Lumpkin Family Foundation in Mattoon, a founding donor to the Chicago Region Food System Fund.

“These producers are the backbone of a resilient local food system and their success is critical to our collective food security. Their ability to access capital in order to pivot business models, ensure their ability to get products to consumers and increase production to meet community need has been critical.

“The Chicago Region Food System Fund is proud to support programs like the Illinois Stewardship Alliance Resilience Fund and their great work providing resources to the family farms we depend upon.”

This delay significantly impacts corn and soybean acreage; both crops play a major role in the global agricultural economy and have triggered a spike in commodity prices, indicating the impacts of climate change on food price volatility and potential food insecurity.

Recent severe weather across the Midwest is making headlines in mainstream news and on social media for its impact on agriculture. The most recent USDA Crop Progress Report states that 32 percent of corn plantings have emerged, compared to the 69 percent average over the past three years, while 11 percent of soybean plants had emerged compared to a 35 percent average; the rainfall delays both crop planting and germination time. Environmental activist Bill McKibben tweeted the alarm “Normally, at this point in [the] season 90 percent of America’s corn crop is in the ground. But thanks to endless rain, it’s 58 percent this year. For soybeans, 29 percent planted instead of the usual 66 percent. A hotter planet = more rain and more drought (and horribly stressed farmers).”

As of June 15th, analysts predicted farmers would be forced to file insurance claims on 2.2 million unplanted soybean acres; soybeans are planted as a backup crop for corn which has “failed to reach the halfway [planting] mark by May 19 for the first time on record” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

All of this rain has caused speculation on the available supply of these crops leading to price spikes. In late May, the Chicago Board of Trade reported escalating prices of corn and soybeans. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported in early June that global food prices rose for the fifth consecutive month in “response to diminishing production prospects in the United States of America… due to widespread flooding and rain.” Corn and soy prices jumped 8.5 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively. By June 17th, corn prices reached a five-year contract high of US$4.64-¼.

The International Food Policy Research Institute has published research finding that climate change causes a decline in global food production and impacts every step of the food chain increasing food prices. Recent NASA imagery shows the impact of this severe weather on cropland and transportation infrastructure using dramatic comparative aerial images of an overflowing Arkansas River and flooding across parts of Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Weeks of flooding washed out roads and breached levees resulting in millions of dollars of damage. The USDA reported the continental U.S. has just experienced its wettest 12 month period resulting in a “painfully slow 2019 planting pace.”

This is not the end of weather-related troubles: “a cool wet summer and delayed planting could reduce yield potential due to a shortened growing season and increased risk of corn and soybeans not reaching full maturity prior to the first autumn freeze,” reports USDA. The FAO predicts that this current decline will still provide a “relatively comfortable supply level.” This current price spike is not on par with those previously experienced in 2008 and 2010 but emphasizes the impact of the globalized food economy in which severe weather scenarios in one country have impacts felt across the world.

96,96,"Sep 15, 2020",Civil Eats,Connecting Fishermen with Hungry Communities Can also Benefit Local Food Systems,"While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw. Tribal members were living in campers and RVs with no electricity and a single hose for running water. Meant to be temporary, these “in-lieu fishing communities” were created in the 1950s when the federal government-built dams that forced tribal members to leave their ancestral fishing grounds.

It was like “being in a homeless shelter, without the infrastructure,” said Rodrigo, who is part Mohawk, a member of the Native American Committee of the American Bar Association, and legal and operations director for We Do Better Relief.

Rodrigo was handing out food boxes as part of a pandemic relief effort led by a new Pacific Northwest coalition called The Wave. Efforts started earlier that day at an event in Cascade Locks, Oregon, in collaboration with the Columbia River Inter-tribal Fish Commission and other groups, before moving out to the in-lieu fishing communities. The event focused on tribal members but was open to the public.

Rodrigo brought 850 pounds of fresh-frozen Alaskan lingcod, a type of groundfish, to provide alongside U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Boxes provided by the Oregon Food Bank. The Wave also provided a food truck, KOi Fusion, that served 400 free teriyaki fish rice bowls, cooked with more of the lingcod.

A partnership with the community-supported fishery (CSF) Alaskans Own, the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, and the Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association, the Wave’s fish donation program involves a slew of Northwest food security groups, tribal organizations, chefs, food trucks, and seafood groups. The groups received funding from a nonprofit accelerator group, Multiplier, to purchase 130,000 pounds of fish from small boat, Alaskan fishermen to provide to food-insecure communities in Washington and Oregon.

While the program focuses on rural, and/or predominantly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), communities, it’s recently pivoted to feeding firefighters and evacuees as deadly wildfires sweep Oregon. Getting seafood—or, truly, any fresh and healthy food—to communities like those in-lieu settlements in Oregon and Washington poses additional challenges, but those are precisely what these partners aim to solve.

The partnership is one of six U.S. fish donation programs funded by Multiplier through its Catch Together program, which supports community-based fishermen. At its core, Catch Together’s grant program aims to provide fishermen a living wage to help feed food insecure families a highly nutritious, lean protein—locally caught seafood—that is rarely, if ever, included in food relief efforts.

“My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

But the fishermen groups it supports, from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, view the program as a bigger opportunity to reconnect local fishermen with their communities, at a time when many feel disconnected by global markets that whisk their catch from the dock to far-flung corners of the world. And they seek to leverage the grant funds to overcome barriers that have made it difficult to integrate their sustainably harvested catch into local and regional food systems.

“All of these different organizations and fishermen, they’re really getting excited about . . . how do we get a little bit closer to the people we’re feeding, and how do we support our communities,” said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, one of the grantees. “My real hope is that we can start seeing fishermen as part of the food system again.”

Shoring Up Fishing Communities

Prices paid fishermen have plummeted everywhere during the pandemic as restaurants have closed or scaled back services. Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, for example, is selling for half the price fishermen were paid in 2019, according to Elizabeth Herendeen of Alaskans Own.

The Catch Together funding allows the groups to buy sustainably harvested fish and pay fishermen a stable price to keep them fishing at a time when one in eight households don’t have enough food to eat. In some cases, as with the lingcod fishermen in Alaska, the grant funds have tipped the balance: Without that funding, the fishermen wouldn’t have been able to go out fishing.

Catch Together encourages its grantees to use its funding as seed money to help them achieve longer term goals to shore up their resiliency—such as by creating a sustainable value-added product, like a fish cake or fish soup, that they can eventually market or get the USDA to purchase for one of its national food assistance programs.

“Our hope is that they’re able to use our grants to create a runway to a sustainable product, or think through how they can serve underserved parts of the community,” Paul Parker, Catch Together’s managing partner and president, told Civil Eats.

Describing Catch Together as a “hub in the middle,” Parker said it’s “uplifting to watch all the different fishing communities come up with ideas about how to serve this need, and then building the programming and cross-pollinating to one another.”

Figuring out the food donation piece can be challenging, however. First the groups need to select the species and harvest the fish, which isn’t always easy. Then they need to turn the fish into a product that’s readily usable by food assistance programs, which can also be tricky: Some programs don’t want seafood because their clients aren’t accustomed to eating it. Last, they need to work out the logistics of the distribution.

“Most of the organizations of fishermen we’re working with have deep experience in one or two of those areas, but not all three,” said Parker.

That’s why Alaskans Own and the Alaska Sustainable Fisheries Trust, which received a grant to harvest lingcod and sablefish, teamed up with the Wave, said Herendeen. “We knew the Wave had the structure in place to help move the fish to families in need.”

Reaching In-Lieu Fishing Communities

The Wave program aims to feed more than 600,000 people in rural and BIPOC communities through early November with a combination of hot meals and fresh-frozen fillets, and it piggybacks off the efforts of other food relief organizations. That means “things change on the daily,” notes Keri Johns, a manager at The Wave.","While delivering food boxes this summer to tribal communities in Oregon’s Columbia River watershed, Bobby Rodrigo was moved by the challenges he saw.

97,97,"Sep 6, 2018",Baptist Standard,One in seven Texas households lacked reliable access to food,"One in seven Texas households had limited or uncertain access to food in recent years, a new study from the U.S. Department of Agriculture revealed.

The report showed 14 percent of Texas households experienced food insecurity in 2015-17, higher than the national rate of 12 percent during the same time period. The study showed significant improvement since 2012-14, when 17.2 percent of Texas households were food-insecure.

However, Feeding Texas—formerly the Texas Food Bank Network—noted Texas still had 1.4 million food-insecure households, more than any other state except California.

“Despite claims to the contrary, hunger is still a major issue facing too many Texans,” said Celia Cole, chief executive officer of Feeding Texas.

Prevalence of severe food insecurity reported

In food-insecure households, which lack consistent access to enough food for everyone to enjoy a healthy diet, families frequently cut back on groceries to pay for lodging, utilities or medicine. Nationally, the typical food-secure household spent 23 percent more on food in 2017 than the typical food-insecure household of the same size and composition, the report noted.

In addition to tracking general food insecurity—which means at some point, a household lacked access to food to provide healthy nutrition for all its members—the USDA also registered the rate of more severe “very low” food security.

Nationally, 4.8 percent of households reported “very low” food security in 2015-17; in Texas, 5.8 percent of households fell in that category during those years. That showed marked improvement over the 6.2 percent of Texas households that experienced “very low” food security in 2012-14, but it was higher than the 5 percent average in 2005-07, prior to the period economists identified as the Great Recession.

“We are encouraged that the food insecurity rate in Texas continues to decline. Over that last several years, organizations and leaders across the state have collaborated to address food insecurity, and we’ve made important strides,” said Kathy Krey, research director of the Texas Hunger Initiative at Baylor University.

“Still, we have not reached pre-recession levels, and close to 2 million Texas households are food insecure, and that number is far too high. We need to continue to work together to build a system wherein individuals and families can access the food they need.”

‘Lots and lots of work to do’

Signs of improvement give Texans reason to celebrate progress in fighting hunger, but the significant number of households that continue to experience food insecurity point to a need for continuing effort, said Ferrell Foster, director of ethics and justice with the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission.

“Those of us who hurt for the malnourished in Texas see in these numbers that we still have lots and lots of work to do,” Foster said. “We are doing better, but there are still more than a million Texans who are uncertain about being able to eat healthy meals. They suffer today, and their malnutrition will have long-term consequences for them, their families and their communities.”

The USDA reported 10 states with a food insecurity rate higher than Texas—New Mexico, 17.9 percent; Arizona, 17.4 percent; Louisiana, 17.3 percent; Mississippi, 17.2 percent; Alabama, 16.3 percent; Oklahoma, 15 percent; West Virginia, 14.9 percent; Kentucky, 14.7 percent; and both Maine and North Carolina, 14.4 percent.

At 7.4 percent, Hawaii had the lowest food insecurity rate in the nation, followed by New Jersey at 8.6 percent and Colorado at 9.2 percent.

In addition to Texas, 11 other states had a higher prevalence of “very low” food security than the national average—Alabama and Louisiana, 7.1 percent; Mississippi and New Mexico, 6.6 percent; Arkansas, 6.5 percent; Maine and Oklahoma, 6.4 percent; West Virginia, 6.2 percent; Ohio, 6.1 percent; and Tennessee, 5.7 percent.

Congress debates future of federal nutrition programs

The USDA released its report at a point when members of Congress were debating the future of federal nutrition programs such as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as Food Stamps.

President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers issued a report in July declaring the War on Poverty is “largely over and a success,” and the council recommended more stringent requirements for nondisabled adults who receive assistance.

The USDA reported about 58 percent of food-insecure households participate in one or more of the three largest federal food and nutrition assistance programs—SNAP; WIC, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children; or the federal school lunch program.

“Our elected leaders should reject any proposal to cut programs like SNAP that help so many Texans make ends meet,” Cole said. “Taking food away from these families by cutting SNAP, or reducing resources for food banks to meet the need of their communities, will only increase food insecurity. … The best way to help our neighbors is not to take food off the table, but put more opportunities on it.”

Any effort to make households more food secure demands the cooperation of multiple institutions, Foster noted.

“Put simply, people need food for today and jobs for their tomorrows. And those who cannot work need our ongoing help,” he said. “Churches, schools and governments must work together to address these issues, and that is being done in more and more places in Texas. We are all in this together.”

FOREST, Miss. (AP) — Days after immigration agents arrested 680 Latino workers in a massive workplace sting at seven Mississippi chicken processing plants, job seekers flocked to an employment fair Monday in hopes of filling some of those now-empty positions.

Koch Foods, based near Chicago, held the job fair to recruit new workers at one of its Morton plants, after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Wednesday arrested 243 workers suspected of working without legal authorization.

By 10 a.m., a crowd of dozens was on hand, and steady stream of people came and went. Most were black and spoke with accents from the American South. A few appeared white or Hispanic.

While the raids at seven plants were unprecedented, chicken processing facilities are normally plagued by heavy turnover and ravenously seek employees. Koch spokesman Jim Gilliland said Monday that job fairs are a “frequent occurrence.”

“They are part of normal efforts to employ,” Gilliand wrote in an email. “In this environment of relative full employment, most businesses are looking for qualified applicants; Koch is no different.”

Eddie Nicholson Jr. of Louisville, among Monday’s applicants at a state employment service office in Forest, was more succinct: “They hire anybody.”

The 25-year-old has worked in chicken plants before and was considering a return, but wanted to see if wages had gone up. Plants in recent years have typically paid $11 to $12 an hour, according to labor statistics, but Nicholson said he wants $15 an hour.

Like Nicholson, many who applied Monday were chicken plant veterans. They understand the arduous and sometimes dangerous work of slaughtering, butchering and packaging chicken, from hanging up live chickens, to pulling off skin, to cutting with super-sharp knives, to boxing up chicken, much of it done in near-freezing temperatures. The line moves fast and people repeat the same motions over and over.

“It’s definitely hard,” said Cedric Griffith of Magee, who said he’s been working at McDonald’s after getting fired from another chicken processor for missing too many days. “You’re going to lose of lot of weight. Nine times out of 10, when that week is over, you’re tired.”

That draining work, at relatively low wages, leads many people to quit. So chicken plants are always hiring. Angela Stuesse, an anthropology professor at the University of North Carolina who spent years among labor organizers in Morton and nearby towns, said the desire for cheap, docile labor led poultry firms to begin recruiting Spanish-speakers in the late 1990s. At first, Stuesse said they were people who could legally work. But they were eventually replaced by Mexicans, Guatemalans and others who often lacked legal working papers. Later, came a wave from Argentina, Uruguay and Peru.

Koch has hundreds of jobs posted for its Morton facilities on a Mississippi state government job board. Only a few dozen other jobs are listed within 10 miles of Morton, many of them at fast food restaurants or dollar stores. The options are a little better in the larger town of Forest, thanks to defense contractor Raytheon and a sawmill. But Tyson, Koch and other chicken plants still dominate the market. Pearl River Foods, a plant raided in the town of Carthage, posted 200 jobs Aug. 1, starting at $7.25 an hour.

Ralphtheia Nichols, a 51-year-old Lake resident, estimated she had worked for various chicken plants maybe 20 times over the decade. She was back Monday to apply again, seeking part-time work.

“This is one of the lowest places for income and they really don’t pay,” Nichols said of employers in the area.

The Koch plant last year agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle a federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission lawsuit alleging that managers sexually harassed female employees and discriminated against them because of their race and national origin. Citing a pattern of immigration enforcement actions after companies got into trouble over working conditions, many Democrats and union supporters in recent days have asked whether the raids had something to do with Koch’s troubles.

“It’s more than just coincidental,” said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who represents areas including other plants that were raised, but not Koch. He and other House members raised the issue in a Friday letter demanding information about the raids from Attorney General William Barr and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan

Gilliland, the Koch spokesman, denied that the raid was related to the EEOC settlement

But whatever triggered the raid, it could have long-term effects on the labor pool. In some places raids have led immigrants to move away. And if they stay, Stuesse said raids tend to keep immigrants terrified of advocating for better wages and working conditions.

“It tells immigrant workers that if they speak up, their worst fears will come true,” she said.

99,99,"Jul 16, 2020",,COVID-19 School Closures Put 30 Million Children at Risk of Hunger,"WASHINGTON, July 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- As COVID-19 infection rates continue to increase in states across the country, many of those jurisdictions are facing the complex dilemma of high infections rates complicating school re-openings and thereby limiting students' access to school-based meal programs. Among the states with spiking infection rates and high percentage of students participating in school-based meal programs are Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina.

In March schools across the country began closing to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In response, and recognizing the important source of nutrition school-based meals were to millions of American children, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service began approving nationwide waivers to provide school systems flexibility in how meals were provided to students. For example, these waivers enable schools to serve meals in non-congregate settings and outside of standard mealtimes, serve afterschool snacks and meals outside of structured environments, and waive requirements that students be present when meals are picked up.

Over half of all students in elementary and secondary schools across the country depend on the National School Lunch Program, and 12.5 million of those students also participate in the School Breakfast Program. As the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools this spring, these students were placed at risk of not having enough to eat.

A new policy brief, Beyond School Walls: How Federal, State and Local Entities are Adapting Policies to Ensure Student Access to Healthy Meals During the COVID-19 Pandemic, released today by Trust for America's Health, reviews steps the federal and state governments have taken to ensure students' access to healthy meals when schools are closed and what needs to be done to ensure continued meal access as all school systems face uncertainties about how to safely reopen for the 2020-2021 school year.

""School meal programs are the most important source of nutritious food for millions of American children. To the degree possible, school systems, with financial and regulatory relief from the federal government, should continue to be innovative about how to deliver meals to students and should strive to meet or exceed federal nutrition standards for these meals despite product shortages created by the pandemic,"" said Adam Lustig, Project Manager at Trust for America's Health and the brief's author.

Due to the economic impact the pandemic has had on millions of American families and the numerous uncertainties about how to safely re-open schools, the currently in place program waivers should be extended through the summer and may need to be kept in place during the 2020–2021 school year, the brief says.

Many of the states hardest hit by COVID also have highest school meal programs participation rates

States with some of the highest rates of COVID-19 infections also have high percentages of students who depend on school meals for much of their nutrition. States in which both COVID-19 infection rates are above national medians and school meals program enrollment is high include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.

States in which more than half of students are enrolled in school-meals programs are:

Percentage of students enrolled in school meal programs

D.C. 76.4% Mississippi 75.0% New Mexico 71.4% South Carolina 67.0% Arkansas 63.6% Louisiana 63.0% Oklahoma 62.5% Georgia 62.0% Nevada 60.8% Kentucky 58.7% California 58.1% Florida 58.1% Arizona 57.0% Missouri 52.7% New York 52.6% Illinois 50.2% Alabama 51.6% Oregon 50.5%

Hunger, poor nutrition and food insecurity can increase a child's risk of developing a range of physical, mental, behavioral, emotional, and learning problems. Hungry children also get sick more often and are more likely to be hospitalized. Maintaining children's access to nutritious meals despite school closures not only ensure they do not go hungry, but also promotes children's health.

""State and federal guidelines waivers have allowed school systems to provide meals to students during the pandemic response, keeping them in place this summer and into the 2020-2021 school year will be the difference between kids who have enough to eat and kids who go hungry,"" Lustig said.

OXFORD, Miss. – As physical distancing to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has transformed the way that Mississippians go to school, do business and care for their neighbors, the North Mississippi VISTA Project is seeking applicants to join efforts to fight poverty in Mississippi through national service.

The North Mississippi VISTA Project has positions for full-time service for summer and yearlong terms of service beginning in June 2020. VISTA members join nonprofit organizations and Title I school districts to support educational attainment, economic opportunity and healthy lifestyles.

While the country practices physical distancing, VISTA members are permitted to support the mission of their host sites through teleservice.

“Already we have seen members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project come forward to support relief efforts in the face of COVID-19,” said Emily Echols, project manager with the University of Mississippi‘s McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement, which leads the North Mississippi VISTA Project.

“From fundraising campaigns to offset the loss of income to working with school districts to deliver school lunches to students living in isolated areas, VISTA members are making a difference for those most at risk of suffering income loss and food insecurity.”

Natural disasters and crises throw the most vulnerable members of society into even more precarious situations. Disparities in income, health status and access to healthy food become more pronounced in emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In such unprecedented times, efforts to alleviate poverty, empower communities and create sustainable solutions are more urgent than ever.

“While VISTA members make a difference at their host sites by increasing the reach of the organization, collectively all members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project are building a better Mississippi,” said Adriana Cooper, VISTA leader. “My time as a VISTA member has permitted me to develop my professional skills while serving my community.”

The North Mississippi VISTA Project needs applicants for summer and full-year terms of service. VISTA summer associates complete 300 hours of direct service to promote literacy and food security over the summer. VISTA members serving yearlong terms help host site organizations by writing grants, developing programs, conducting outreach, managing volunteers and strengthening partnerships.

All VISTA members receive a living allowance of approximately $950 per month and can select either an end-of-service education award of $6,195 ($1,311 for summer associates) or a cash stipend of $1,800 ($311 for summer associates). Members serving a yearlong term also are eligible for a health benefit, a child care benefit and a housing stipend, if offered by their host sites.

“The North Mississippi VISTA Project is central to the McLean Institute’s mission to fight poverty through education in Mississippi,” said Albert Nylander, McLean Institute director and professor of sociology. “Our work is needed now more than ever.”

In the last four weeks, their markets seemed to collapse inward, folding almost without warning like failing parachutes.

Hers didn’t. Neither did many other hyper-local markets across springtime Florida, where small farmers are selling the last of abundant winter produce directly to consumers, people who live within a few miles of the fields where their food is raised and harvested.

But that’s only a tiny portion of traditional demand — of what Florida farmers have become accustomed to growing and selling both within our borders and far beyond.

Here, Florida Weekly looks at the state of agriculture in Florida as spring moves toward summer. We offer a sobering picture, but one with suggestions from farmers and others, those in the business of food distribution, for people who wish to help the agriculture industry or change it, while continuing to eat well.

At the 85-acre Worden Farm in Charlotte County, Mrs. Worden and her husband, Chris Worden, grow organic vegetables for hundreds of customers. Those sign up in advance to get fresh local food in weekly boxes from Worden Farm — in season only — or find it at farmer’s markets now mostly closed, from St. Petersburg to Fort Myers and Naples. Some come to the farm and pick it themselves.

“There is so much difficulty for fellow farmers now because of the sudden change in demand from large-scale buyers — the hospitality industry, schools, cruise lines and others — and we don’t like to see that,” she said.

“But we have done this intense, small-scale farming for almost 20 years because we feel having a direct connection with a customer is essential for regional food security. We don’t feel the (large-scale) way of farming is sustainable.”

Hers is community-supported agriculture, but it represents only a tiny portion of food produced to feed the appetites of Florida and the nation.

In large part, the United States is supplied with many fresh winter vegetables mostly by Florida farmers, who are now under siege.

In a report earlier this month, Gene McAvoy, a several-decades extension agent now serving as associate director of stakeholder relations at the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences — Mr. McAvoy also is president of the National Association of County Extension Agents — painted the dilemma this way, beginning about a month ago.

“On Tuesday, March 24 … everything changed. From brokers, orders stopped and everything got quiet. Wednesday, the 25th, (was) super-quiet.

“Since then tomato volumes are down 85%, green beans 50%, cabbage is (down about) 50%.”

The markets in restaurants and cruise lines dried up all of a sudden, he said: “Four million people in the winter season who eat lavishly three times a day cruise from Miami alone,” he said. “And 120 million tourists per year go to theme parks.”

All that has stopped, taking away markets and dropping prices farmers can get for meat and fish, and destroying markets for fresh produce.

“So if you look at Immokalee, at this time of year in the height of the vegetable season they ship out 400 to 500 semitrucks a day, or 15 to 17 million pounds of vegetables,” he said. “Multiply that by (the produce from) Homestead, Manatee, Ruskin: 50 to 60 million pounds of veggies a day. When the markets suddenly disappear, that throws a wrench into things.”

Farmers under assault

In once case, he reported, “R.C. Hatton has plowed under 100 acres of green beans, around 2 million pounds, and 60 acres of cabbage, or 5 million pounds.”

Paul Allen, a co-owner of the 12,000-acre R.C. Hatton Farms based in Palm Beach County’s Pahokee, on the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, said the loss is unprecedented as a sudden event in March and April, when the growing season usually pays off in product.

But not this year. This year the product is there, but not the pay-off for some vegetables. Crops such as corn or potatoes, which aren’t immediately perishable, or the sugar cane R.C. Hatton produces, can be stored to await a market recovery, if that doesn’t take too long.

Citrus growers are relatively unscathed since the fruit can be processed.

But fresh produce can’t wait.

“We’re harvesting about 50% of our green beans and cabbage — those are basically food-service specific, crops sold in food service like restaurants and hotels, so supermarkets can’t absorb it all,” Mr. Allen explained. “We’re giving all we can to food banks, but people don’t realize how large the food service market is. The food banks aren’t prepared to take it.”

Giving it away isn’t as easy as it sounds, either, simply because harvesting the food — getting it out of the fields, and packaged, then shipped — isn’t easy.

“There’s an associated harvest cost,” Mr. Allen said. “Many times it’s as much as the growing cost. A lot of farmers are harvesting anyway and giving it away to charities because they hate to see it wasted — but you’re losing more money. And you can only go so far with that.”

Mr. Allen and R.C. Hatton, however, along with many other farmers, have already gone a long way with that, according to Karen Erren, executive director of the Palm Beach County Food Bank. There, 66 of the 125 pantries open a year ago have now been closed, while the demand for food (with safe distribution) at each of the remaining 59 has increased between 20% and 60% since last year.

“We were at R.C. Hatton yesterday looking at green beans for the Palm Beach County Food Bank,” Ms. Erren said. “He, like the entire community of growers, is extraordinarily generous. Palm Beach County is the most agriculturally prolific county east of the Mississippi River, and the grower community gives so much. Last fiscal year, I distributed 100,000 pounds of food per week from my food bank, and more than a third, more than 1.5 million pounds, came from our farmers.”

Still, a great deal is wasted, farmers say, because farms with sometimes elaborate infrastructure designed to ship to food service customers aren’t able to make the shift in shipping to other buyers, either quickly or inexpensively. Milk from dairy farms, for example, may customarily go out in 20-gallon containers to food service clients — not in gallon, half-gallon, quart, pint or half-pint containers such as those used in stores or schools. Consequently, the milk may be lost because it’s much more costly to change the shipping infrastructure.

Kim Jamerson, who owns about 1,300 acres in Lee and Hendry counties with her husband, Mike Jamerson, described what happened only four weeks ago, this way:

“The market slowed down, then one day our broker told us to stop picking — so we quit picking for 10 days and abandoned the field. We’re not like a fisherman who could park his boat, get off for 10 days, and then go right back. Down here in the brutal heat and no rain, we lost our crops. We tried to salvage some and couldn’t. One of those is our money field — I call it our money field: We have yellow squash and cucumbers, zucchini, bell pepper and eggplant.”

Americans — Floridians — who might typically seek out those fresh vegetables, now might not since unemployment rates have soared in the state and country. Those shoppers, along with others suddenly more cautious, changed their shopping habits starting in March, buying processed food with longer shelf lives, Mr. McAvoy noted: canned food, rice and beans, cereal and the like.

To complicate the challenge, when farmers like Mr. Allen or the Jamersons stop picking, either they have to continue paying farmworkers brought from Mexico into the country under the H2A program — the Jamersons pay them $9 to $15 an hour depending on the crop, provide workers’ comp and other benefits, Mrs. Jamerson said, which is not the case on many farms — or send them back home.

“We are a food safety-certified farm, we have H2A workers, workman’s comp, we pay top dollar — so even on a good day how can we compete fairly with food shipped across borders from places that don’t have to treat workers that well?

“It’s not a fair fighting field on a good day, and certainly not in a crisis,” she concludes.

The government should step in, buy and store the food, if necessary, and keep American farmers afloat feeding Americans, which also means cutting down on imported food, she insisted, echoing the arguments of others.

If people want to help, “they should call the politicians.”

And last week she did just that, talking with aides in U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s office. They complimented her ideas without agreeing to do anything about them, she acknowledged.

If farmers leave crops in the field simply to rot, or don’t harvest vegetables in time for second-yield plants to produce a new crop, not only is the harvest lost, but the plant can be killed. Then unless it’s all plowed under immediately, the field becomes a magnet of sorts for pests and disease, which in turn affect other crops.

The import problem

Meanwhile, the farmers point out, food keeps coming across U.S. borders in significant quantities — on the order of 200 semitruckloads of various vegetable or fruits per day, said Mr. Allen.

Farmers and brokers can keep track of shipments by watching reports from several sources, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “Specialty Crops Market News” that lists food shipped from within or without U.S. borders, its place of origin, its growing conditions, and its quantity.

A glance at the tomato market, for example, shows the following at www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/wa_ fv454.txt: (amounts are listed as units of 10,000 pounds; a semitruck can carry about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds):

During this 2020 season through April 11, Florida shipped by truck 49,196 of the total 53,484 of U.S. units (4,288 units came from Tennessee).

Mexico had only 1,119 units imported by truck, but added 72,681 units of tomatoes described as “adapted environment;” 3,960 as “controlled environment;” 4,917 as “greenhouse;” and 15,780 as “open field.”

The U.S. had one unit of organic tomatoes — those were from Florida — while Mexico had eight units of organic greenhouse tomatoes and 260 of organic adapted environment tomatoes.

In total, there were 164,564 units listed in a single table by the USDA — there are other tables, too. Less than half came from the U.S., almost all from Florida, where “growers are walking away from big portions of their crops,” Mr. McAvoy reported.

In Mr. Allen’s view, if people want to help farmers, “You should buy American products in your stores … and pray for us.” That also is Mrs. Jamerson’s view, coupled with the notion that the government can do a lot more than it has to protect farmers.

And in Mr. McAvoy’s view, people who want to help should make monetary donations to food banks.

“And some people are, they’re giving to food banks,” he said, “but the food banks are overwhelmed. They don’t have trucks or manpower or the storage space.”

Food banks and new ideas

Food banks have always been part of the industry of agriculture in Florida, both farmers and food bank managers say. But now more than ever that’s true, as huge amounts of fresh produce have become available from Florida fields — available but not necessarily accessible or obtainable, so far.

“This is mostly bad economic news,” explained Richard LeBer, president and CEO of the Harry Chapin Food Bank serving five counties in Southwest Florida.

“Some people are sick, or having to care for kids at home, and they’re on unemployment or reduced income. So, we’ve seen 70 to 80% increases in demand this year from the same period last year. There have been over 24 million unemployment applications in the past few weeks in the nation. And it’s concentrated among certain folks: Retirees are fine, but service industry people are devastated by this.”

They need the food, but neither Harry Chapin nor other nonprofit food banks can store too much of it.

“We’ve seen a substantial increase in demand at our nine food pantries,” said Steve Popper, president and CEO of Meals of Hope, with seven outlets in Collier County and two in Lee.

“So we’ve converted them to drive up pantries for anybody — all you have to do is prove that you live in the county.”

Instead of waiting in line now, people wait in cars. “As they pull up,” Mr. Popper said, “we put food in their cars. We distribute a kit or box of dry items — cereal, canned goods, pasta. In addition, we’re putting in frozen meat of some type, and produce. That’s what we’re doing at all our pantries. We’re giving each person enough food to feed a family for the week.”

And right now, he added, “We’re giving out food to more than 1,500 families each week. In March of last year, it was about 850. If we had additional storage space, we’d be able to give out more than that.”

In an irony of the times — both because of limited storage space for fresh produce and the hugely increased demand — the Harry Chapin Food Bank has been forced to spend more money than ever on nonperishable food.

“In normal times in this region our main suppliers are grocery stores, your Publix or Winn-Dixie, your local Walmart,” Mr. LeBer explained. “They’re constantly turning over stock, so we get the last cans of beans or the 3-day-old steak.

“That works well most of time, but since everybody has cleaned out the grocery stores, that’s been off.

“So now we’re spending a lot of money we normally don’t buying shelf-stable stuff from the manufacturers.”

It’s a cost they can ill afford. “We’re spending $150,000 a week just in the five counties, to buy from wholesalers,” he admitted.

It just might work

But Robin Safley has a plan she hopes to kick off beginning this week that could benefit not only food banks but farmers who don’t want to see their crops turned into dirt, while helping employ people out-of-work.

Executive director of Feeding Florida based in Tallahassee, with 12 food banks around the state affiliated with Farmers Feeding America, Mrs. Safley uses a model called PPO in obtaining food from farmers.

The acronym stands for Pick and Pack Out. Feeding Florida aims to pay for the harvest cost farmers incur in picking and packing out their produce, so they don’t have to plow it under.

“Right now at this time of year Florida is feeding the country — we come into harvest while people elsewhere are still in snow,” she said.

But in the current crisis, “the only way we can make a big difference for Florida growers losing fresh produce is to extend its shelf life,” she said.

In an idea first conceived by her friend John Rivers, owner of 4 Rivers Smokehouse, with restaurants in South Tampa, Kissimmee and Coral Springs, Mrs. Safley may have found a way to do that — and she hopes to test it with one semi-truckload of mixed food, about 40,000 pounds, beginning this week.

“We want to take the product in and convert it to a long shelf life. How? Freeze it? Bring it into a production kitchen and make soups or tomato sauce out of it? Yes. And these ideas have components that employ people. So (John Rivers, who also heads the charitable nonprofit 4R Foundation) has commissary kitchens.”

His and other restaurants, now closed, are a wasted resource unless they can be used, she suggested: “So if I can put product in there and they can make soups or tomato sauce or anything else, that helps growers, it helps restaurants, and it employs people.”

The test run, however, won’t happen at 4 Rivers, it will happen at one of her 12 food banks, the Treasure Coast Food Bank, in St. Lucie County. That one’s equipped with a production kitchen.

“We’re trying to pick up a mitt after the ball’s been thrown,” she said. “So we will start by taking one semiload of fruits and vegetables, and once we’ve run that we’ll do a lot more. We’re working with mixed growers and mixed products.”

She has some big donors and some big trucks, which will allow her to “bring the product out of the field, cut it, dice it, bag it, extend the shelf life, and put it in donated freezers.”

Eventually it can be used by seniors and families in need.

The program is only for Florida growers and Floridians, she said. Farmers who wish to participate may contact one of the following: sherri@feedingflorida.org, or robin@feedingflorida.org.

Mrs. Worden, meanwhile, hopes the current crisis in agriculture and food supply creates “a greater appreciation for regional food security and for a sustainable food system, with farmers and buyers working together.”

Nobody is against that in Florida agriculture, apparently.

“We’ve long believed that having food as a centerpiece of your home life and activities can have a positive influence on your physical and emotional health,” she added. “You can become more grounded in the biological process of what it means to be alive.

“Health is wealth and food is the basis of health. The way we choose to feed ourselves can have an effect on our own organisms, in our eco-systems, and from there it has an impact on air and water and the global system.”

And one other thing. “Some people may begin to feel invincible, as though we are not a vulnerable species. We are vulnerable. But sustainable food as a solution to health — as a positive choice — is within our reach.” ¦","But that’s only a tiny portion of traditional demand — of what Florida farmers have become accustomed to growing and selling both within our borders and far beyond.

The Republic | azcentral.com

JACKSON — White supremacist ideology is helping fuel domestic terrorism in the United States, the head of Homeland Security said Tuesday.

Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan appeared in Jackson, Mississippi, for a forum about preventing violence against religious groups. The conversation included references to mass shootings, including the recent one that killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso.

Authorities in Texas say the white man charged in the shooting told police he was targeting Mexicans.

""The attack in El Paso and the violent white supremacist ideology that inspired it offends us all,"" McAleenan said Tuesday. ""We must address it with moral clarity, this hate that is domestic terrorism, and it must be resisted together by Americans of all races, ethnicities and faiths.""

""Racism is a national security threat,"" said Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee.

Critics of President Donald Trump contend his language has stoked racial and ethnic divisions. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi did not name names but said ""the racist, xenophobic language that we hear coming from high places"" empowers people ""to do crazy things.""

Tremendous fear: El Paso shooting heightens fear of daily life for Latinos in Mississippi

Thompson and Jackson Lee also criticized raids last week in which 680 Hispanic immigrants were arrested at food processing plants in Mississippi, the largest workplace sting in the U.S. in at least a decade.

""Last week's massive ICE raid will have an enormous long-term effect on the state of Mississippi,"" Thompson said. ""I do not understand why ICE picked this time, right after the country was healing from the targeted attack on Mexicans, to perform these raids in this community. ICE turned the first day of school, a special day that is to be filled with smiles and happiness, into a fearful memory for many of the children in Mississippi.""

McAleenan told NBC on Sunday that the timing of the raids was ""unfortunate,"" but the action had been planned for more than a year.

Jackson Lee said Tuesday that racists who target Hispanics or other people of color can be bolstered by the workplace raid.

""They see a brown person and they see the government rounding up and they're saying, 'That's what I should be doing, but I won't round up. I will kill,'"" Jackson Lee said.

McAleenan said that domestic terrorism, whether at houses of worship or other places, ""has a broad and expansive impact on American citizens and our national climate.""

""These attacks not only end lives, they also degrade our society and diminish the integrity of our national values,"" McAleenan said. ""They pull at our civic seams and our diverse country and they challenge citizens' faith in their government's ability to protect them. Domestic terrorism jeopardizes both our physical security and our perceptions of security.""

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Staff members within Mississippi State’s Office of Financial Aid led a team effort to help students in need of food items and other basic supplies, and their effort culminated this week with a donation to Bully’s Closet and Pantry.

Director of Financial Aid Paul McKinney said his staff has been meeting weekly on WebEx, and they decided during one of these online discussions to help students facing a difficult time.

“The Financial Aid office works with needy students everyday helping them bridge their financial gap to ensure their ability to attend college and be successful. However, the staff wanted to do something more for our students, and they really pulled together to make this happen,” McKinney said. “To be able to do something for them during a time of need is such a blessing.”

The Office of Financial Aid reached out to include other units within MSU’s Enrollment Services, including Account Services, Admissions and Scholarships, the Office of the Registrar, and Orientation and Events. Then, staff members spread the word to family, friends and neighbors about the collection, which they carried out while observing social distancing.

“We all worked together to make this successful,” McKinney said. The result was a truck bed full of items donated to Bully’s Closet and Pantry, which opened in January as a resource for nutritious food, professional clothing, toiletries and other basic items. Students may pick up items for free at the 120 Morgan Ave. location and only need to present their MSU I.D. card. A collaborative effort between the university’s Division of Student Affairs and the Student Association, Bully’s Closet and Pantry is part of the MSU Food Security Network, a broader initiative to meet students’ basic needs throughout their time at the state’s leading university.

104,104,"Jun 9, 2020",CNN,Groceries were hard to find for millions. Now it's getting even worse,"New York (CNN Business) The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and limited delivery slots for online groceries.

But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

In 2015, an estimated 39 million people, or 12.8% of the US population, lived in ""low income and low access areas,"" according to the USDA's most recent data

The areas are defined as those where a ""significant"" portion of the population lives more than a mile from the nearest supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles away in rural areas. The poverty rate is either 20% or greater, or the median-family income is below or equal to 80% of the statewide median family income.

Such areas are commonly known as food deserts, even though the term has no official meaning. it's increasingly difficult for the people who live in them to buy food.

During the pandemic, grocers have cut back their operating hours. Public transportation has been reduced, and riders who once traveled to stores in other neighborhoods or cities can no longer do so. Some older or higher-risk populations are fearful of traveling during the pandemic.

There's also evidence that food accessibility challenges are growing. In Georgia, the number of residents now living in ""food insecure"" areas has jumped 69% since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data firm Urban Footprint. The firm uses an index, including jobless claims, pre-existing health conditions, and access to grocery stores and healthy food, to measure food security — or ""reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritionally adequate food.""

In Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky the number of residents living in food insecure areas has spiked 43%, 36% and 118% respectively, driven by the rise in unemployment, according to the analysis

The pandemic has made it ""very cumbersome"" to buy groceries, said Yolanda Jackson, who lives 1.6 miles from her nearest grocery store in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2018, 23.5% of Baltimore residents lived in an area where access to healthy food is limited.

Jackson usually takes the bus to Shoppers grocery store, but stopped during the pandemic in part because of the long waits. She has been going to corner stores and bodegas ""where the selections are low and the prices are high,"" she said.

Online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who rely on food stamps.

s minorities. The problem of food access disproportionately affectminorities. Research from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that lower-income minority neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores compared with similar white neighborhoods.

""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data.

'Online grocery shopping is not equal'

Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce, public health experts say.

Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.

""With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than processed items,"" said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes.

During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online.

Amazon AMZN Walmart WMT In states that do allow recipients to use their benefits online, their options are usually onlyor, which have gaps in where they deliver groceries to customers' home. And some deliveries have minimum purchase requirements or added shipping fees, which can be a barrier for low-income customers.

""Access to online grocery shopping is not equal,"" said Caitlin Caspi, assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Rep. Sanford Bishop, chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Subcommittee, wrote to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue last week urging the department to expand the number of grocers eligible to participate in the online program. ""Of the approved retailers, only two are national chains and only one of the national retailers can reach our most rural communities,"" Bishop said.

As food access challenges swell during the pandemic, cities, food banks, schools and community organizations are trying to find creative solutions.

""The public school system and many charter and private schools are continuing to offer meals to children and some of our urban farmers and chefs are teaming up to make meals for people in their neighborhoods who are in need of food,"" said Winona Bynum from the Detroit Food Policy Council.

In Baltimore, the city has developed an emergency response strategy. It's working to expand residents' participation in the food stamp program, which allows for online purchasing in the state of Maryland. The city has also ramped up delivering boxes of shelf-stable groceries and produce to residents' homes.","But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

105,105,"Nov 8, 2019",,Update on girl whose father was detained during Mississippi ICE raid,"MISSISSIPPI - Magdalena Gomez Gregorio hugged her father for the first time in months after she tearfully begged in front of reporters for his release following a massive immigration sweep in Mississippi.

Her father, Andres Gomez-Jorge, was released from immigration detention last week after relatives and friends raised funds to pay his $7,500 bond.

His daughter's voice was heard around the world in a video that went viral after immigration authorities rounded up hundreds of undocumented workers at several Mississippi food processing plants in early August.

""I need my dad. ... He's not a criminal,"" Magdalena said, sobbing as she waited with other children at a local gym that offered food and shelter on the day of the raids to children whose parents had been taken.

Gomez-Jorge had been working at the Morton Koch Foods plant in Morton, Mississippi when the raids occurred. His wife, Juana, who asked to be identified only by her first name out of fear for her family's safety, didn't sleep for days while waiting for word about her husband.

Now, the couple and their four children are ""extremely happy"" to be reunited but are unsure of what their future holds.

""I don't know what I will do. I don't know what will happen,"" Gomez-Jorge said, when asked about his plans.

He has not received a court date just yet and is struggling to find work. He wants to work in construction but he says jobs are scarce because it is starting to get cold.

Because Gomez-Jorge brings in all the income and is currently unemployed, the family of six has been surviving on donations of food and money.

No charges against employers

Three months after the raids, there are still no charges filed against any of the owners or companies involved in employing the more than 650 undocumented workers that were detailed after the raids.

Affidavits made public after the historic August 7 raids showed federal agents suspected that the food processing plants unlawfully hired undocumented workers.

On Thursday, several Democratic lawmakers from the House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security questioned an ICE official at a hearing Mississippi, and pressed him to explain why no employers have faced charges.

Jere Miles, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations' New Orleans office, told committee members that no employers had been arrested as a result of the raids, noting that the investigation was ongoing.

Investigators seized 850,000 documents and 22 terabytes of information, he said.

106,106,"Dec 15, 2020",Truthout,54 Million Americans Are Projected to Be Food Insecure by End of Year,"As autumn fades and winter looms, the dire predictions public-health experts made about Covid-19 have, unfortunately, proven all-too-accurate. On October 27th, 74,379 people were infected in the United States; less than a month and a half later, on December 9th, that number had soared to 218,677, while the 2020 total has just surpassed 15 million, a number no other country, not even India, which has a population three times that of the U.S., has surpassed.

And now, it seems, the third wave of the virus has arrived. As recently as late October, the embattled Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, warned that “we are in for a whole lot of hurt” and that infections could reach 100,000 a day. As it happens, he was wildly optimistic. A little more than a month later, there were more than twice that many. Is it possible, however, that the current surge is due in part to increased testing, as President Trump and others have regularly claimed? Here’s the problem. Even if that theory were true, it can’t account for the spiraling death toll, which is now more than 300,000 and could hit 450,000 by February, according to Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nor can it explain the daily Covid-19 hospitalizations, the first round of which peaked at 59,712 on July 23rd, dropped pretty steadily to a low of 28,606 on September 20th, and then started to soar, reaching 106,671 on December 9th.

Though big-picture statistics like these should help us grasp the staggering magnitude of our current public-health crisis, what they don’t reveal is the searing effects it’s had on the lives of millions of Americans, even those who have managed to evade the virus or haven’t seen friends or family fall ill or die from Covid-19. The pandemic has been especially hard for those on the front lines: doctors, nurses, and other hospital workers who experience battle fatigue and despair while besieged by suffering and deaths, visceral reminders of their own vulnerability.

In society at large, precautions — lockdowns, social distancing, limits on festive gatherings — necessary to keep Covid-19 at bay have increased loneliness and social isolation. Contrary to early expectations, reports of abuse and violence within families haven’t actually spiraled, but experts suggest that may be because the victims, confined to their homes alongside their tormentors, are finding it harder to seek help and fear reporting what’s happening to them. As for children, teachers are no longer seeing their pupils in person as regularly and so are less able to spot the typical warning signs of mistreatment.

Thankfully, the pandemic has yet to increase this country’s already alarming suicide rate, but the same can’t be said for levels of stress and depression, both of which have risen noticeably. School closures and the move to online learning have forced parents, particularly women, to scramble for childcare and to work less, even though many of them were barely getting by while working full-time, or stop working altogether, often a genuine disaster in poor families.

Not surprisingly, people who have been laid off or had their work hours reduced have fallen behind on their mortgage and rent payments. Although various federal and state moratoriums on such payments, as well as on evictions and foreclosures, were enacted, such protections will eventually end. And the moratoriums don’t negate renters’ or homeowners’ obligations to settle accounts with their bankers and landlords somewhere down the line (which for many Americans may, in the end, prove an impossibility).

Food and the Pandemic

Apart from the illness and death it causes, perhaps the most poignant consequence of Covid-19 has been the way it’s increased what’s called “food insecurity” across the United States. That ungainly term doesn’t refer to the chronic food scarcity and undernourishment, which afflicts more than 800 million people in poor countries, but rather to the disruption of people’s typical food-consumption patterns. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) distinguishes between what it calls low food security (“reduced quality, variability, or desirability of diet”) and the very low version of the same (“multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake”).

Surveys by the USDA and the Census Bureau show that both variants have risen steeply during the pandemic. Just before the coronavirus struck, 35 million Americans, 11 million of them children, experienced food insecurity, the lowest figure in two decades. This year, those numbers are projected to reach 54 million and 18 million respectively. In 2018, 4% of American adults reported that at least some members of their family did not have enough to eat; by July 2020, that figure had hit 11%, according to a study by Northwestern University’s Food Research and Action Center, and will only increase as the pandemic worsens.

Income supplements provided by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act that Congress passed in March in response to the economic problems created by Covid-19, increases in the government’s Supplementary Nutritional Program (SNAP), and the Pandemic Electronic Benefit (P-EBT), which helps parents whose children no longer get free or subsidized school lunches, have made a difference — but not enough to make up for lost or reduced income, lost homes, and other disasters of this moment. And sadly, any follow-up to the CARES Act, assuming Congress reaches some kind of agreement on its terms before the current legislation expires at the end of December, will almost certainly be far less generous than the original law. The SNAP increases already excluded the poorest seven million households that were then receiving the maximum amount, and the new increases now under discussion in Congress would add less than one dollar to a four-person family’s maximum daily benefit. P-EBT expired in most states at the end of September, in some as early as July.

That food insecurity has “skyrocketed,” as the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities puts it, during the pandemic despite government assistance shouldn’t come as a surprise. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Some have seen their earnings diminished because of furloughs, wage cuts, freezes, or reduced working hours. Others have looked for jobs in vain and finally given up (but aren’t included in official unemployment statistics). Millions of adults have children who no longer receive those free or subsidized lunches because of the switch, in whole or part, to online teaching. Worse yet, as pandemic-induced firings, layoffs, and wage cuts have reduced incomes, and so consumer purchasing power, food prices, especially for meat, fish, and eggs, have only risen. Such costs have increased for other reasons as well. The pandemic has disrupted supply networks, national and international. Leery consumers, anticipating shortages or seeking to reduce trips to grocery stores to avoid being infected by Covid-19, have also resorted to panic buying and the stockpiling of food and other necessities.

Who You Are and Where You Live Matters Most

Of course, not everyone has been hit with equal force by rising food prices. Americans high on the income ladder can absorb such extra costs easily enough and, in any case, spend a substantially smaller portion of their income on groceries. According to the USDA, adults with incomes in the top fifth of society spent 8% of their income on food last year; for the bottom fifth, it was 36%. The first group also obviously has a lot more money available to stock up on food than that bottom fifth, so many of whom have also become jobless or seen their paychecks diminish since the pandemic started. In March, for example, 39% of those making less than $40,000 had already lost their jobs or had their paychecks reduced, but only 13% of those who earned $100,000 or more, and that gap continued into the fall.

Not surprisingly, then, the bigger the hit people took from the Covid-19 recession, the more likely they were to experience food insecurity, which is why aggregate statistics on the phenomenon and other societal problems attributable to the pandemic can be misleading. They tend to mask the reality that its effects have been felt primarily by the most vulnerable, while the others have been touched much more lightly, or not at all.

The variations are rooted in ethnicity and location as well as income level (and the three tend to be closely linked). A USDA report classified 19% of Black households and 16% of Hispanic households as food insecure in 2019, compared to 8% of their white counterparts. By this summer, food insecurity had increased significantly across the board, afflicting 36% of Black, 32% of Hispanic, and 18% of white households. While the pandemic has certainly made matters worse, African Americans had the highest rate among those three groups even before it started. This was especially true of counties — the U.S. has more than 3,000 of them — in which they were in the majority. In 2016, those particular counties accounted for a mere 3% of the national total, but 96% of them had “high food insecurity,” as the Department of Agriculture defines it, as well as a poverty rate more than twice the national average (12.7% that year).

Native Americans have had the worst of it, however, since many of their families lack access to running water and plumbing (58 per 1,000 households compared to three per 1,000 for whites). Nearly 75% of Native Americans must travel more than a mile to reach a supermarket, compared to 40% of the population as a whole, and the disruption of supply chains has only diminished their food security further relative to other ethnic communities. Even prior to the pandemic, counties in which they (or Native Alaskans) constituted a majority were among those with the highest levels of food insecurity. Not coincidentally, in 2016, the poverty rate in nearly 70% of Native American-majority counties averaged a whopping 37%.

In other words, while every group has suffered in this pandemic year, race matters — a lot — when it comes to the degree of suffering.

So does income. In coronavirus-stricken America, only 1% of adults with an annual income exceeding $100,000 surveyed by the Census Bureau this summer responded that, during the preceding week, their household “sometimes or often did not have enough to eat.” Compare that to 16% of those making $25,000-$35,000 and 28% of those earning less than $25,000.

Finally, food insecurity during the pandemic has varied by location as well. Ten states (and the District of Columbia) had the highest rates, ranging from Mississippi (33.5%), which stood atop this group, to Alabama (27%), which had the lowest. In between, in descending order, were Washington, D.C., Nevada, Louisiana, New York, New Mexico, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

Food Banks and Pantries: On the Front Lines

The other day, a close friend described to me the daily scene at a food distribution center in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood. Well before trucks laden with food pulled up early in the morning, he said, the lines had already started forming, hundreds of people waiting patiently in a queue that encircled the block. And that’s just one of many neighborhoods in New York where this is all too typical these days. In Queens, for instance, one pantry regularly faces a demand so steep that lines can extend for eight blocks. Try to imagine what the waiting time must be. All told, 1.5 million people in the city, unable to buy the groceries they need, rely on food pantries, and New York is anything but unusual. Photographs abound of cars lined up by the hundreds, even thousands, at food pantries in major cities around the country.

Feeding America, a non-profit organization that supports 200 food storage centers and 60,000 pantries nationwide, reports that the country’s food banks have provided the equivalent of more than 4.2 billion meals since March, a 50% increase compared to a year ago and 40% of the people who come to such pantries are first-time visitors. A Consumer Reports survey of grocery shoppers found that nearly a fifth of them had turned to a food pantry since the pandemic began (half of whom hadn’t sought such help at all in 2019). In March, before the first wave of Covid-19 began to peak, 18 million Americans already used food pantries; by August, that number had climbed to 22 million, even though an additional 6.2 million people had received benefits from SNAP (the food-stamp program in common parlance) between March and May alone. By early July, 37.4 million people had signed up for SNAP compared to 35.7 million for all of last year.

Little wonder, then, that food banks, facing a tsunami of demand, have struggled to stay stocked amid rising prices, shortages, reduced donations from big chain supermarkets, and disrupted supply chains. It’s also become even harder for them to raise the money they need to operate. Not a few have buckled under the strain and many have been forced to shut down. Pantries have also had a hard time mustering volunteers, in part because seniors, particularly vulnerable to the virus, made up a significant segment of such helpers. Not surprisingly, then, food banks and pantries have battled to function or simply survive in these months, while also having to implement an array of cumbersome and costly safety measures to keep volunteers, staff, and clients infection-free.

Despite their heroic role, such food banks and pantries are the equivalent of the proverbial finger in the dike. For Covid-induced food insecurity and hunger to decline significantly, the third wave of infections will have to subside and Congress will have to offer more effective aid. The Trump administration’s recent proposal, blessed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to provide a one-shot $600 check to all adults (whether they’re unemployed or not) certainly isn’t. At the same time, vaccines will have to be produced in sufficient quantities and distributed rapidly. (We are far from ready on that front.) All this in a country where striking numbers of people look askance at vaccination — in a December survey only 63% of Americans said they would be willing to get vaccinated against Covid-19 — and are also drawn to conspiracy mongers whose appeal has grown, thanks in part to social media.

Once the virus is vanquished or at least brought under reasonable control, the economy can be reopened. Then, many of the nearly 11 million at-present unemployed people will perhaps have a shot at working again or having their employers end reduced hours and cut wages.

Here’s hoping that these various stars align by summer 2021. We can then revert to pre-pandemic normalcy, even though that state of affairs was marked by substantial poverty — 34 million people last year — and rising inequality.

“I appreciate Dean Kent Hoblet and our world-class CVM faculty and researchers for their leadership and mentorship of these two outstanding veterinary students,” said Keenum, a former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture who has made food security a central focus of his professional life.

Barber is being mentored by Dr. Amelia Woolums, a professor in CVM’s Department of Pathobiology and Population Medicine. Woolums is board-certified in internal medicine and veterinary microbiology. Barber, a 2019 MSU CVM Bardsley Scholarship recipient, is focusing her research on alternatives to antibiotics in treating bacterial and viral diseases in livestock.

Lucas’s research focuses on developing system dynamics modeling to reduce antimicrobial use in the cattle industry. His mentor is Dr. David Smith, a board-certified veterinary epidemiologist and CVM’s Mikell and Mary Cheek Hall Davis Endowed Professor for Beef Cattle Health and Reproduction.

“Cassandra and Alec have completed their first year in the CVM curriculum and are currently participating in the college’s Summer Research Experience Program. Both have already shown themselves to be excellent students,” Hoblet said. “Both Amelia and Dave are fantastic teachers, researchers and mentors, and we are grateful to them as well for all they have done and will continue to do to advance our program.”

STARKVILLE, Miss.—As Mississippi State’s nearly 1,600 newest graduates celebrate their milestone accomplishments at commencement ceremonies in Humphrey Coliseum today [Nov. 25], MSU President Mark E. Keenum is applauding their abilities to adapt and overcome challenges.

“We’ve made it through this most challenging of years together,” he said. “All of you have overcome so much to get here today.”

Keenum spoke by video to graduates from the university’s eight colleges across the day’s four graduation events. He said contact tracing showed he had been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, thus necessitating his change of plans for attending the celebrations in person. Keenum said he is well but has not completed his quarantine period.

“Now more than ever, a college degree and all that you have learned here will help you succeed in a world that is undergoing unprecedented change. I also believe that the timeless values we hold dear as members of the Mississippi State University family will serve you well—you will need integrity; you will need to work hard; you will need to show respect for others,” Keenum said.

He added that “considering our current pandemic situation, there is another value that is also very important—courage.”

In his 12th year of tenure, Keenum is a three-time MSU graduate with degrees in agricultural economics. The former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has guided the university to unprecedented heights, and his interest in international food security has strengthened the university’s contributions to global economic sustainability. He has led MSU to record growth in enrollment, capital improvements and fundraising. Keenum and other university leaders were commended recently by a resolution of MSU’s Robert Holland Faculty Senate for “exemplary transparency and cooperation, their tenacity and flexibility, and their courage and grace in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic so as to minimize medical danger and consequences for faculty, staff and students alike, and to successfully continue the educational, research and service missions of the university during this unprecedented crisis.”

By Tamara Sandberg, Advisor, U.S. Food Security & Nutrition

For more than a decade, child hunger in America was trending in a positive direction: down. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the number of households with children that reported struggling with food security was steadily decreasing since the Great Recession, dropping to a two-decade low of 13.6 percent in 2019. Alarmingly, child hunger has skyrocketed across the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic. New research from Northwestern University underscores a heartbreaking reality. Since March, food insecurity rates have tripled for families with children across the nation and are disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic families.

One child struggling with hunger is one too many. Before the pandemic closed schools, Save the Children supported kids through early education programs across rural America. Visits to these programs make clear that child hunger is pervasive in rural America. Pre-pandemic, nearly 90 percent of the nation’s counties with the highest rates of child food insecurity were rural. In California’s Central Valley, the Mississippi Delta, or in my backyard in Appalachia, kids often sprint off the school bus in the morning, making a beeline to the cafeteria for the free breakfast served at school. Getting nutritious meals to children outside school buildings proved one of the biggest challenges to overcome during widespread school closures this spring.

Organizations including Save the Children, food banks, and community and faith-based groups rose to the occasion and worked tirelessly to meet the urgent need of hungry kids. In fact, Save the Children helped prepare and deliver nearly 9 million meals across rural America since schools were shuttered to ensure kids weren’t missing out. That number continues to grow as remote and hybrid learning models carry on during the pandemic.

But we can’t rely on nonprofits and generous individuals alone to fill the food gap. Specific, focused investment at the federal and state level is essential to ensure children do not continue to go hungry. The federal government must approve a 15 percent boost in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and increase the minimum monthly benefit to $30 as part of the solution. We need Congress to take action and put resources directly and immediately into American’s wallets. Every SNAP dollar spent generates about $1.54 in economic activity, so this investment helps local communities and economies, too.

SNAP is critical for helping children grow and helps break the cycle of poverty. Meeting children’s basic nutritional needs helps ensure they are healthier and better able to succeed in school. When children grow up smarter, stronger and healthier, our nation is smarter, stronger and healthier, too. Elected officials, please join us in strengthening our children’s futures. We need your leadership and commitment to ensure every child has a strong, healthy life.","Nourish the Nation by Combatting Child HungerBy Tamara Sandberg, Advisor, U.S. Food Security & NutritionFor more than a decade, child hunger in America was trending in a positive direction: down.

110,110,"May 3, 2019",Jackson Free Press,Mississippi Women Could Benefit Most from Lift on SNAP Ban," Mississippi women stand to gain the most now that the U.S. government will no longer be able to bar state residents with felony drug convictions from receiving federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.



Congress passed the ban in a 1996 welfare reform bill but offered states the option to opt out. The Mississippi Legislature opted out of those prohibitions in March, leaving them in place in just one state, South Carolina. West Virginia opted out of the ban earlier this year. The ban included the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program.

The prohibitions disproportionately affect low,-income women and people of color, said Madeline Morcelle, a staff attorney at the Mississippi Center for Justice who focuses on food security issues. Women lead men when it comes to disqualifying felony drug convictions. On top of that, she said, women, especially single mothers, are most likely to experience hunger.

""We know that women overall access SNAP at higher rates because of that situation, so lifting the ban will secure access to those who were disproportionately in need,"" she said.

Morcelle pointed to ""systemic"" causes and ""historical injustices,"" like redlining and segregation, that she says are to blame for the federal law's impact on African Americans.

""So both of these populations will realize significant gains in food security because of this policy change,"" she said.

As the Legislature debated Mississippi's new Criminal Justice Reform Act earlier this year, Republican state Sen. Sally Doty pushed her colleagues to include a lift on the ban—which did not include violent felons.

""I saw no reason to treat drug felons differently than those with violent offenses,"" the Brookhaven senator told the Associated Press on May 2. ""And the ban had a larger effect on women, who generally have lower-paying jobs and could greatly benefit from the education and training programs, as well as the nutritional support. The overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities.""

Morcelle, similarly, told the Jackson Free Press that lifting the ban could help reduce recidivism rates. More than 90% of people experience hunger within their first year of exiting the criminal justice system, she said. Access to SNAP would not only help alleviate hunger issues, she said, but would make re-entry easier through the job training programs it offers.

The Mississippi Center for Justice's website notes that women are more likely to receive a drug-related conviction than men, and that most women with drug-related felonies have children.

The ban could also prevent family reunification between parents and children post-incarceration, the center notes, but lifting the ban could also help reduce recidivism rates, and lower costs to the foster care and the criminal justice systems.

Because food assistance programs like SNAP and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)

The lift on the food assistance ban is part of the larger criminal justice reform package the Legislature passed in March and that Gov. Phil Bryant then signed into law. It also expands drug courts, ends the practice of automatically suspending driver's licenses for simple drug possession charges or failure to pay fines, and includes other provisions to help with employment opportunities post-release.

The Criminal Justice Reform Act goes into effect on July 1, 2019. The Jackson Free Press could not reach Doty's office for comment by press time.

111,111,"Sep 9, 2020",Agri-Pulse,US food insecurity fell ahead of pandemic,"Food insecurity in the United States dropped again in 2019 ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has cost millions of Americans their jobs and continues to send many into food lines, the Agriculture Department reported Wednesday.

According to USDA’s annual survey of U.S. hunger, which was conducted last December, 10.5% of U.S. households, or 13.7 million, were food insecure in 2019, meaning that their access to food was limited by lack of money and other resources.

That rate was down from the 2011 high of 14.9% and well below the pre-recession level of 11.1% in 2007.

Rates of food insecurity are substantially higher than the national average for several groups, including households headed by Blacks (19.1%), Hispanics (15.6%) and single women (28.7%).

Some 15.4% of households headed by men were food insecure in 2019, and women and men living alone had rates of 13% and 12.8% respectively.

While the 2020 food insecurity rates won’t be released for another year, participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program jumped from 37 million in March to 43 million in April, the latest month for which USDA has released data. That doesn’t capture the number of people who have received help through food banks and other feeding programs and may be ineligible for SNAP.

According to a recent Census Bureau survey of households, 22.4 million adults reported that their household didn’t get enough to eat in the last seven days.

Some 4.1% of all U.S .households, about 5.3 million, were classified in a more severe category known as “very low food security,” which means that food intake of some household members was reduced and their normal eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year.

There was no statistically significant difference between the 2019 rate for that more severe category of food insecurity and the 2018 rate of 4.3%.

Children were food insecure at times during 2019 in 6.5% of the U.S. households that have children. That rate was not statistically different from the 2018 rate of 7.1%.

USDA economists report rates of food insecurity for individual states on a three-year rolling average, 2017-2019, and Mississippi continues to have the highest rate at 15.7%, followed by West Virginia (15.4%), Louisiana (15.3%), New Mexico (15.1%) and Oklahoma (14.7%).

New Hampshire has the lowest rate at 6.6%, followed by New Jersey (7.7%), Iowa (7.9%) and Minnesota and North Dakota, each with a rate of 8.3%.

The report, which came out last week, grouped Alabama with other states to be included as both among the poorest and the most hungry. Other states on the report included Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Kentucky and West Virginia.

The report for the most hungry states came from data collected from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service’s 2018 report “Household Food Security in the United States.” In that report, 14.7% of Alabama’s population was not food secure.

For the poorest states, the report cited information from the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau survey, which stated that Alabama’s poverty rate was 16.8% as of the survey.

“There is much welcome news in the latest government data, but we cannot ignore the fact that hunger and poverty persist in our country. These decreases are important and they reaffirm the vital role federal anti-poverty programs play in ensuring low-income Americans can obtain the benefits that help meet our basic human needs,” said Diane Randall, executive secretary for FCNL, in a written statement. “As Quakers, we believe that no one in this country should be hungry and suffer from want.”

114,114,"Nov 7, 2019",Border Report,House Democrat criticizes Mississippi chicken plant raids,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — It’s “disappointing” that President Donald Trump’s administration is selectively enforcing laws to apprehend immigrant workers who are in the U.S. illegally but not prosecute employers, a U.S. House committee chairman said Thursday.

Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and House Homeland Security Committee chairman, made the criticism during a hearing about federal immigration raids in August at seven Mississippi chicken processing plants where agents arrested 680 mostly Guatemalan workers.

“Not one employer or person from management has been arrested,” Thompson said. “In fact, prosecutions of companies who hire undocumented workers have declined compared to the previous administration’s numbers. The selective way the administration is enforcing our laws is disappointing.”

Mike Hurst, chief federal prosecutor for the southern half of Mississippi, said Thursday that 119 people have been indicted after the raid and 47 have pleaded guilty so far. Of those, Hurst said 26 have pleaded guilty to fraudulently using a Social Security number, while 21 others have pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after previously being deported. The rest face some combination of those charges.

Jere Miles, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, pleaded for patience, saying agents are examining 850,000 documents and 61 digital devices to build cases.

“We’re not satisfied with going after the low-level people, but as I’m sure you all understand, it is a lengthy process,” Miles testified.

The Democrats called the arrests unnecessary, inhumane and demeaning, with U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee saying she would push for a law against separating parents and children because of immigration enforcement.

“I believe we should clarify that there is no policy, no dictate, that directs ICE and any other agency, no law to separate families from children,” the Texas Democrat told reporters.

She and others called it a waste of resources to bring in 600 federal agents to arrest 680 people. Thompson said just agents’ wages for the day cost $478,000.

Witnesses said federal agents failed to coordinate with local authorities to make sure children wouldn’t return home to empty houses, saying children remain traumatized, especially because many parents are still in detention.

“The trauma of these children is too painful,” testified the Rev. Odel Medina, pastor of St. Anne Catholic Church in Carthage “They do not understand why their parents have been arrested.'”

Miles called it an “oversight” that some school districts weren’t contacted, and told reporters later that “I think that there are lessons that need to be learned.” But he also pushed back against the idea that people who violate immigration laws should be treated differently from other criminals.

“Like anyone who gets arrested for a crime in the United States, they can’t go home,” Miles testified. He echoed top Homeland Security officials who say arresting people working illegally in the United States is important because it will cut off the incentive for others to come.

“When we take some of the economic incentive away, it is going to have an impact,” Miles testified.

Witnesses also questioned federal prosecutors’ decision to indict so many people. Cliff Johnson, a University of Mississippi law professor and former assistant U.S. attorney, said prosecutors take some cases and decline others daily, and that what prosecutors were doing in Mississippi is “wrongheaded.”

“These people are not criminals …,” Johnson testified. “Many of them are young mothers with a third-grade education or less, who themselves have been victimized by crimes. There are only a handful that have even a misdemeanor conviction.”

Hurst, though, defended the prosecutions.

“Turning a blind eye to their illegal acts would not be fair to our nation, their victims, or the millions of naturalized American citizens who waited years and meticulously followed the process by which to become an American,” he said in a statement.

Thompson and other Democrats promise legislative action, but it seems unlikely to arrive in time to help those facing criminal charges or deportation.

“We’re not going to stop speaking until we have a way to citizenship that allows us to contribute to this country with peace and tranquility,” said one woman who was arrested, who would only give her name as Lorena, citing fear that speaking up could worsen her legal troubles.","This young woman cries while standing outside the Koch Foods Inc., plant as U.S. immigration officials raid the plant in Morton, Miss., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2019.

With millions of workers staying at home to aid public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, the security of America’s food supply and its supply chains has rarely been more important. At this moment, to the extent that there is a challenge in ensuring America’s grocery stores have enough healthy food on the shelves, it comes not from insufficient natural bounty but instead from the extraordinary burdens that COVID-19 has placed on the many low-wage workers who play such central roles in the functioning of food supply chains.

Indeed, during these trying times, farmworkers’ contributions in particular are more critical than ever. They cannot shelter at home to remain safe from COVID-19; instead, they must go to work—along with meatpacker employees, truckers, and grocery store workers—to ensure that the nation’s food supply is maintained. Farmworkers are particularly vulnerable to illness because of high rates of respiratory disease being an occupational hazard, low rates of health insurance coverage, and often substandard living and working conditions. Despite these risk factors, agricultural workers—the majority of whom are immigrants and about half of whom are undocumented—lack many of the legal protections enjoyed by most workers, which endangers their own and their families’ health and well-being.

The pandemic’s disruption of normal economic activity is clearly illustrating how crucial farmworkers are to national security and food access around the world. The European Union is already feeling the effect of tightened borders on the supply of farm labor. Farmers in the United Kingdom and Germany are reporting labor shortages, and the agricultural minister of France recently urged professionals in the industries that have been locked down to seek out work on farms. Yet farmers worry that the new workers they do recruit domestically will lack the skills necessary to efficiently harvest crops without damaging them.

Travel and immigration bans enacted in the United States and around the world have put stress on a preexisting shortage of farm labor. To supplement the domestic labor supply, many farms in the United States often rely upon the H-2A program to hire seasonal agricultural workers from other countries. In 2019, the United States issued more than 200,000 H-2A visas—accounting for about 10 percent of the agricultural workforce. Overall, including the significant share of undocumented immigrants who have for decades been the backbone of this nation’s agricultural labor force, 53 percent of farmworkers were born outside the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Last month, the U.S. Department of State announced that it would stop processing visas in Mexico, much to the alarm of growers who rely heavily on immigrant labor to meet seasonal needs. Subsequently, the State Department announced that H-2A visa processing will resume, while in-person visa interviews will be waived for anyone who interviewed the previous year. In the end, as the fear of labor and food shortages grew, the State Department decided to waive the in-person visa interview requirement for all H-2A applicants, both new and returning workers, as well as seasonal nonagricultural workers seeking entry through the H-2B program.

Furthermore, President Trump recently announced plans to sign an executive order temporarily banning people from immigrating permanently into the United States, but the anticipated announcement reportedly will not affect the entry of seasonal agricultural workers into the United States or provide any additional safeguards for the health and safety of those workers or people with whom they may come into contact.

The administration’s efforts to facilitate the entry of farmworkers into the United States even as it bans countless other immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers speaks, in part, to the important role that such farmworkers play in supporting the American economy and the country’s food security. It is reasonable for the State Department to make it easier for more farmworkers to come in order to prevent an impending food shortage. But bringing in still more workers without taking extra precautions to protect their health and safety—as well as the health and safety of all farmworkers and people with whom they interact—would be shortsighted. If nothing is done to ensure that proper protections are put in place for these farmworkers and other vulnerable food chain workers, these workers are not the only ones jeopardized; the workers that they will be living and working alongside are also at risk. Not only that, but broader efforts in the community to tamp down the disease through social distancing and sanitation efforts will also be undermined. Moreover, if farmworkers begin to contract the coronavirus, farm labor supply will decrease—with a potentially devastating effect on food production. More must be done to safeguard these important workers as they perform essential tasks.

Protecting farmworkers is essential to the nation’s food supply chain. An outbreak among farmworkers can potentially shutter entire farm operations at a time when the supply chain is already experiencing unprecedented disruption. Earlier this month, after three farmworkers tested positive for COVID-19 in Cayuga County, New York, and one of them died, farm owners became even more aware of the spread of the disease. Swift action to prevent the spread of the coronavirus must be taken. This is even more urgent in light of the shuttering of several meatpacking plants due to widespread infection among workers. Essential workers are not disposable.

Farmworkers are essential to the food supply

Many growers have long been pushing to ease requirements and expand the scope of H-2A workers in the United States to meet farm labor needs. But particularly during the novel coronavirus pandemic, it is essential that employers and the federal government also ensure the safety and security of participants—as well as that of current farmworkers and other food system workers such as meatpackers—to strengthen the security of the U.S. food supply.

The experiences of guest farmworkers pose several risks of infection. For example, migrant farmworkers journeying long distances to the United States travel on crowded buses chartered by their employers. Once in the country, they reside in employer-provided housing, which is often crowded and inadequate. These facts of daily life make it difficult, even impossible, for farmworkers to maintain social distancing and proper sanitation. If measures are not taken to ensure the health and safety of farmworkers, COVID-19 may spread rapidly among the agricultural workforce—with possibly dramatic negative implications for the national food supply.

Measures must be taken to safely meet the demand for agricultural workers. However, workers must be adequately screened before being permitted entry and must be guaranteed safe transportation, housing, and working conditions to ensure their safety and the safety of people around them. This is necessary not only to protect workers but also the supply chain itself. If one worker is forced to work while ill or is unable to access testing or care, employers risk infecting their entire workforce, which could completely shut down their operations.

Farmworkers’ basic needs must be met

Because farmworkers are essential workers on the front lines of the pandemic, lawmakers must address these workers’ safety. Unfortunately, employers do not always prioritize the safety of farmworkers, and federal law exempts farmworkers from some of the rights most other workers enjoy.

As a result of their occupation, farmworkers face increased risk of exposure and serious illness due to the coronavirus. Farmworkers commonly suffer from respiratory illnesses due to occupational hazards such as the application of pesticides—conditions that may make people more vulnerable to dangerous complications from the virus. Farmworkers who require masks and respiratory protection to safely apply pesticides or perform other tasks may soon find it difficult to procure the equipment they need due to the stress the pandemic has put on the personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain. Moreover, farmworkers often work in fields with limited access to bathrooms or basic sanitation, making it difficult to implement many of the preventive measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

If farmworkers do get sick, they likely do not have access to paid leave to take time away from work to access medical care, and they face enormous barriers to receiving the testing and care that they need to recover and keep their communities safe. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, less than half of all farmworkers, and only 24 percent of undocumented farmworkers, have health insurance. Though Congress made free COVID-19 testing available to uninsured people through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, this measure excluded many categories of immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, H-2A workers, and Temporary Protected Status holders. Moreover, rural health systems, which hospital closures have put under strain, may not be able to provide the needed care.

Despite the hazards that farmworkers face, they receive far fewer legal protections than most other workers. For example, farmworkers are not entitled to overtime pay, and farms with fewer than seven workers in a given quarter may not have to pay even the federal minimum wage. Moreover, federal law does not protect farmworkers’ right to organize unions, making it difficult for them to band together to bargain for better pay and working conditions. Some states have expanded labor rights to farmworkers. A recent New York law extends to agricultural workers overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 60 hours per week and the right to unionize. However, the state-by-state patchwork still leaves many of these essential workers unprotected.

The lack of federal legal protections for farmworkers is particularly dangerous for undocumented workers and workers with H-2A visas, whose status is dependent on petitions filed by their employer. The monopsony power gives employers leverage over workers, making it difficult for farmworkers to bargain with employers for better wages or working conditions because they cannot leave for another job without jeopardizing their immigration status.

In addition to gaps in coverage under federal labor laws, undocumented workers, who make up about half of the entire crop farmworker labor force, are reluctant to report labor law violations because of their immigration status. The fear of deportation looms large, and undocumented workers do not qualify for unemployment insurance and other social safety nets that they may need if they become sick. Though the House of Representatives passed the Farm Workforce Modernization Act in fall 2019 with a strong, bipartisan vote, the Senate has yet to take up the bill. This legislation would provide a pathway for eligible undocumented farmworkers to gain permanent residence. Yet even in the absence of legislative reform, much more can and should be done to protect workers who are currently undocumented.

Recommendations

Lawmakers must take immediate action to safeguard the farmworkers on the front lines of the pandemic. The United States cannot afford to leave farmworkers vulnerable, nor should farms be permitted to recruit migrant workers without proper safety measures in place. Farmworker employers must be required to adopt necessary measures, and operations that acquire labor through contracting companies must be held accountable as joint employers. Congress must take action to expand farmworker protections at the federal level.

Health protections

For the safety of rural communities and the security of the food supply, all farmworkers need access to free testing and treatment for COVID-19, regardless of immigration status. Rural health care access must be expanded, with particular attention to farm communities. This includes significantly increasing funding to community health centers that serve immigrant and farmworker populations in rural areas and expanding broadband access. With government support, recently closed rural hospitals could temporarily be reopened, field hospitals could be set up in areas that anticipate care shortages, and multilingual telehealth options could be made available to all—insured or not.

In addition to ensuring access to health care, lawmakers must ensure that workers’ health is protected on the job. First, farms must be required to provide their employees with timely and accurate information about COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Awareness is key to preventing the spread of the virus among farmworkers, who may live and work in close quarters. However, awareness is not enough if workers are not provided with the ability to follow the guidelines. Future legislative responses to the pandemic must enact stricter workplace safety standards, much like the stricter standards imposed in hospitals to protect health care workers. For instance, employers should make sure that their workers have sufficient handwashing stations and restrooms in workplaces and in employer-provided housing. Employers must also be required to implement modified working arrangements that allow for social distancing, such as putting fewer workers at conveyor belts at the same time.

Through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, employees are entitled to 80 hours of emergency paid sick leave and 12 weeks of emergency child care leave—with 10 of the 12 weeks paid. This includes farmworkers who are employees, or H-2A visa holders, for employers with between 50 and 500 employees. However, improvements to the federal emergency paid leave protections must cover employees of all farming operations, regardless of size.

Beyond requiring farm employers to take commonsense health measures, Congress and the Trump administration should deploy resources to provide much-needed aid to workers. The Trump administration should use the Defense Production Act to procure PPE during the pandemic, and once a sufficient supply is established, some of the equipment procured should be set aside to ensure that farmworkers and other essential workers can perform their jobs safely. The USDA’s Rural Housing Service must receive emergency funding to erect temporary housing for farmworkers who are ill or in a high-risk category and to build supplemental housing where accommodations exceed capacity and do not allow for social distancing. Finally, Congress must appropriate additional funds to migrant and seasonal Head Start programs to supply critical child care. These measures will equip these essential workers with the resources they need to stay healthy.

Hazard pay and economic security

Farmworkers are essential workers on the front lines of this pandemic, risking their health to feed the country. Federal law must require all farms to pay the minimum wage—regardless of the size of the operation—and guarantee the right of farmworkers to organize a union and bargain collectively. Currently, less than 1 percent of farmworkers are unionized, which severely hampers workers’ abilities to bargain for fair wages and better working conditions, not to mention enforce labor law. Unfortunately, rather than raising wages for these essential workers, the White House is exploring ways to lower wage standards for H-2A workers, according to NPR reporting.

Moreover, unemployment insurance must be expanded to cover all farmworkers. While farmworkers are recognized under federal law as eligible for unemployment insurance, smaller farms are not covered unless specified in state statutes.

Many farms are expecting emergency payments as a result of the third COVID-19 relief bill recently passed by Congress, which raised the borrowing limit of the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, making an additional $14 billion available for emergency payments. Congress must require that farms that receive this assistance pay their workers hazard pay equal to twice their usual wage, as well as overtime on top of that. To ensure enforcement of all worker protections, Congress should embed in every USDA office a Department of Labor detailee to serve as a farmworker advocate responsible for directing outreach to farmworkers to inform them of their rights and provide legal aid. To provide additional support, future coronavirus relief packages should also provide increased funding for community organizations that serve farmworkers, particularly those that help enforce labor rights.

Immigration

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently issued guidance identifying farmworkers and people involved in food processing and packaging as essential critical infrastructure workers. For this reason and others, just as DHS should issue a clear formal statement prohibiting immigration enforcement actions at or near health care facilities, it should refrain from routine immigration enforcement activities on farms and in processing plants. In general, civil immigration enforcement actions should be curtailed during the COVID-19 pandemic, unless there is a significant public safety concern that outweighs the dangers of crowded detention facilities. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus made a similar ask of the Trump administration recently, noting that preserving the nation’s food supply by protecting farmworkers is a national security imperative. Undocumented farmworkers should not live in fear of deportation, nor should they be forced to refrain from accessing vital medical care if they need it. Moreover, these critical workers should not fear retaliation from employers if they miss work due to feeling unwell. While U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement initially announced plans to modify its enforcement practices during the pandemic, tweets from the account of Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, suggest that policy was quickly reversed by higher-ups within DHS and even President Trump himself.

In addition to modifying immigration enforcement practices, the government needs to do more to protect current and new immigrant farmworkers. For workers who are already here on H-2A visas, the State Department should allow for automatic extensions and make it easier for visas to be transferred to a new employer.

Going forward, the federal government should require H-2A employers to take specific measures to protect their workers from the coronavirus. H-2A employers must demonstrate that they have taken the steps outlined in this brief to maintain a clean and safe workplace. Additionally, since many migrant workers live in employer-provided group housing, employers must guarantee that housing is properly ventilated, compliant with capacity limits, and thoroughly disinfected in compliance with CDC guidance. Employers must also guarantee transportation that is regularly sanitized and allows workers to comply with social distancing guidelines. Congress should ensure that farming operations are reimbursed for any extra costs that they incur as a result of taking preventive measures to protect their workers during the pandemic. These conditions must be certified and enforced by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency under DHS tasked with approving all visa applications; the Department of Labor; and the USDA. To ensure that permanent reforms are implemented to protect one of the most essential segments of the U.S. workforce, Congress should work toward a successful passage of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.

Conclusion

Even before the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers were the backbone of the nation’s food security, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of Americans every day. But during the current public health crisis, their work is more important than ever, as farmworkers continue to go to work—at great personal risk to themselves—to keep food in stores and on plates. Failing to protect these essential workers risks the security of the nation’s food supply. Therefore, the United States must ensure that these workers are provided with ample means to protect themselves from the virus and that they have safe and clean workplaces, economic security, and an ability to take paid leave if needed. These measures need to be in place for all farmworkers, regardless of immigration status, to make sure that they are given the opportunity to work safely to put food on American tables.

118,118,"Dec 31, 2020",NBC News,"As Covid surges in Mississippi Delta, food banks and hospitals are stretched thin","JACKSON, Miss. — Four days before Christmas, Chiquikta Fountain watched as a growing line of cars stretched down a mile of road in the Mississippi Delta.

From her vantage point, it seemed like every resident in the rural town of Shaw was en route to the holiday meal giveaway at Delta Hands for Hope, a nonprofit she runs to support the area’s children.

The Dec. 21 event was meant to be a cheerful affair, despite the desperate need. Hams had been purchased from a mom-and-pop grocery store. There were bags of freshly picked greens, potatoes and onions for sides. With schools on winter break, volunteers tucked cereal and cases of orange juice into bags to help tide over families with children into the new year.

There were only 140 meals to distribute in the town of roughly 1,700. The meals were meant for a group of families and senior citizens who have relied heavily on the nonprofit for weekly assistance. But word spread quickly and it soon became clear that the food on hand wouldn’t be enough.

As supplies dwindled, the group began passing out the remnants. Produce for one person, a few boxes of cereal for another.

“To have to turn these families away,” Fountain said, “I can’t even describe what it felt like to you to do that.”

Before the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger. Almost 40 percent of its residents live in poverty. In areas like Shaw, trying to make ends meet has become even more fraught as the county struggles with the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the Mississippi Delta.

Weekly case counts in December have surpassed the peak of the county’s summer surge, when so many fell ill that the county coroner asked the board of supervisors to purchase an extra refrigerator for fear he would run out of space to store the dead.

That the recent surge has so far claimed fewer lives compared to previous peaks has left little room for comfort. Cases in the county quadrupled in the weeks after Thanksgiving.

Statewide, hospitalizations for patients with the virus spiked, plummeting the number of available intensive care unit beds in the state’s rural areas and larger cities alike. By the third week of December, Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, the county’s only hospital, ran out of ICU beds, a situation that could recur as cases rise.

L. Nicole Stringfellow, who leads the Mississippi Delta office of Together for Hope, a nonprofit that assists the country’s poorest rural communities, has heard concerns about people with pneumonia showing up at hospitals only to be sent home with instructions to monitor their symptoms.

Caitlyn Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bolivar Medical Center, acknowledged that the hospital had seen an increase in patients, but said its admitting and triage practices had not changed.

The Covid-19 crisis has compounded existing health care challenges in Bolivar County: Almost 1 in 6 residents are uninsured and more likely to put off treatment as a result, and there is a shortage of medical providers.

Unlike major cities where people can access public transportation, residents without cars in rural areas like Shaw have few options for getting to medical appointments. Almost 1 in 8 households in Bolivar County lack a car, making carpooling for errands common.

Nurse practitioner Nora Gough-Davis owns Shaw Family Medical, a clinic that offers home coronavirus testing for patients without the means to come into town. Some patients feared exposing their loved ones to the virus if they asked for a ride.

Several times a week, Tracy Hall, a nurse at Shaw Family Medical, dons a surgical gown, mask, face shield and gloves and enters a home. Sometimes, she sees a patient lying on a couch, barely able to move as she swabs.

Every morning, her husband gives her the same goodbye.

""Babe, be safe.""

On the way to work, she says a prayer in her car. On occasion, patients have asked her to pray that their tests come back negative.

She understands their fears. In Bolivar County, the fallout from the virus has been particularly pernicious. Three out of every 1,000 residents in the area have died from Covid-19. Only a handful of communities in Mississippi — several of them, like Bolivar, predominantly Black and in the Delta — have lost more.

Before Mississippi’s state health officer uttered the words “hot spot,” before the local hospital ran out of ICU beds, health outcomes for Black residents in Bolivar County were already troubling.

The consequences of a shortage of health care providers in the Mississippi Delta have been evident for decades. Shorter lives. Higher rates of amputations. Stringfellow said political leaders haven’t paid enough attention to these disparities. The pandemic, she said, makes it harder to look away.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

She pointed out that four years ago, the State Health Department shut down one of the two state-run medical clinics in Bolivar. A steep drop in patients was cited as the reason, but Stringfellow said the health care needs in the region remain high.

“How do you catch those areas up?” she asked. “True access to health care.”

The current state of public education, economic opportunity, housing and health care in the region, all beleaguered in their respective ways, she argues, are “putting a Band-Aid on open-heart surgery.”

While the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has brought a note of hope for many front-line workers, physical health is only one part of the battle. The mental trauma that accompanies persistent poverty in the Delta has escalated as families struggle with the fallout of the pandemic.

“It’s like working in a funhouse mirror,” said Nadia Bethley, a psychologist with the Delta Health Center, a nonprofit that provides health care to low-income patients on a sliding fee scale. “Things weren’t great before. Now, they’re distorted and worse in a lot of ways.”

She feared for her patients leading up to the first Christmas some would experience without their loved ones. She worried about those who were already isolated becoming further detached, like many others around the world affected by this pandemic. Patients who loved attending church services and socializing before and after sermons didn’t feel the same connection online.

Others have survived the virus only to feel challenged cognitively, almost like they had a stroke. Bethley said they want to know if they’ll fully recover.

“Having to sit with people and hold space for that kind of uncertainty, shrugging my shoulders, like ‘I don’t know either,’ those are the kind of things that have hit hard the most,” she said.

Many of her patients have found their livelihoods in limbo.

“Family members who were the primary breadwinners are now dying,” Bethley said. “Do you go to work and put yourself at risk, or do you become homeless or starving?”

Job security remains fragile in the community. Half of the residents make less than $30,000 per year. And although Cleveland, the county seat of Bolivar, is a university town, which brings economic activity, good jobs are scarce enough that some residents travel across state lines for work. For two years, dozens of residents have gathered daily outside the county’s Walmart, one of the few grocery stores in the area, waiting for charter buses to ferry them to Memphis, Tennessee, two hours away, to work at a FedEx hub, where some workers make upwards of $18 per hour.

The county’s unemployment rate, which climbed to double digits in the summer, has since improved, but remains higher than this time last year.

Caressa McKay, a single mother of five in Shelby, a small town in Bolivar County, was laid off from her job at a day care center in June. She’s since found another job, but she still has to skip a phone bill or an electric bill some months to make sure her children have enough to eat.

The public assistance she receives is “not enough to constantly keep food on the table,” she said. Meals dropped off by her local school district help, but with her children home all day for remote schooling, they need more food.

“They have to eat,” she said. “I have to do what I have to do.”

Mississippi state Rep. Abe Hudson Jr., a Democrat who lives in Bolivar County, said workers have been hit hard as local businesses struggle to stay afloat.

The people who are seeking help, he said, run the gamut from middle-class professionals now stretched thin to elderly residents hesitant to enter grocery stores.

“You don’t realize the degree of need until you go out to some of these food distribution events,” Hudson said. “It’s a constant reminder of the fact that people are not getting paychecks.”

That reminder is never far from Fountain.

The nonprofit she leads, Delta Hands for Hope, previously served as a tutoring site for students and assisted with volunteer projects. Last spring, the center began operating an emergency food pantry.

But now, the food bank’s future is in question. Recently, the nonprofit went from receiving 800 boxes of fresh food twice a month to none.

The U.S. Agriculture Department’s food box program had changed its funding rules and declined to renew a contract with the farm that had been supplying Delta Hands for Hope.

Fountain’s group now uses a private grant to buy food from a corporate restaurant supplier with the goal of feeding at least 140 children and senior citizens in Shaw per week. She’s unsure if the funding will carry them past spring break.

Occasionally, she receives an alert that a church or a food bank in the region has enough to share. The group rents or borrows a truck to pick up the food.

“The biggest question is, ‘Are we going to remain an emergency food pantry?’” she asked. “What happens when those funds run out?”","Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi TodayBefore the pandemic, Bolivar County knew hunger.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State’s poultry science department is now equipped with a new laboratory for conducting biosecurity level 2 research.

The department’s Animal BioSafety Level (ABSL)-2 facility, which opened last month, provides a distinctive setting for investigating and conducting research on pathogenic bacteria that affects the poultry industry.

Mary Beck, professor and head of MSU’s Department of Poultry Science, said the ABSL-2 lab enhances the department’s commitment to serve the Mississippi poultry industry through the land-grant mission of education, research and outreach.

“We are extremely excited for our department and MSU to have this facility come to fruition. This space, which was funded by the university’s Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, will help our scientists conduct research vital to this state’s most important agricultural industry,” Beck said.

Earlier this year, National Chicken Council and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association reports indicated that Mississippi’s poultry industry had an annual impact of $20 billion on the state’s economy and employed 28,500 growers and employees generating $1.5 billion in federal, state and local taxes.

Beck explained how the facility will accommodate research that benefits the industry as a whole, from the egg to the plate.

“This lab mimics a setting you’d find in the poultry industry, which allows our scientists to evaluate different aspects of disease and infection as it affects birds throughout their lifecycle from in the egg, to grow out, and ultimately harvest,” Beck said.

Researchers, including faculty and students, are trained on health and safety protocols and procedural safeguards that have been implemented to protect people and animals alike. The facility includes six individual rooms for housing battery cage and floor pen trials, a research lab to culture and study pathogens, separate screening rooms complete with sinks and sanitation stations, an autoclave, and restroom and shower facilities. Every room is fitted with a separate HEPA-filtered air handling system. Digital controls allow for the reliable control and maintenance of appropriate temperatures, lighting and humidity.

Professor Aaron Kiess, who spearheaded the effort to bring the lab to MSU, said the facility will help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat infections caused by Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and Clostridium bacteria, aiding an industry that is a vital component of food security.

Kiess said the lab provides a chance for researchers to help the poultry industry improve management strategies in disease prevention and mitigation.

“As the industry moves to a ‘no antibiotics ever’ program, now more than ever, it’s critical that we find an alternative to antibiotics, so the poultry industry can maintain safety and health of their birds for the public,” Kiess said. “If we could find antibiotic alternatives that inhibit infectious diseases caused by pathogenic organisms, this could reduce mortalities and improve bird health, leading to improvements in growth performance and ultimately more profit.”

In addition to MAFES funding, contributions to the facility were made by international animal health company Huvepharma, Inc., with all light fixtures, bulbs and dimmers provided by www.aglights.com and Overdrive Lighting.

120,120,"May 24, 2019",UT Knoxville News,Study: High Rates of Food Insecurity Found at Southern Appalachia Colleges,"College students in Southern Appalachia are affected by food insecurity at a higher rate than the national average, which can translate into poor academic performance and unhealthy spending habits and coping mechanisms, according to a new study coauthored by researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and published in Current Developments in Nutrition.

Researchers found that food insecurity has an average prevalence of 30.5 percent among college students who responded to online surveys at 10 four-year universities in the Southern Appalachia region, which includes Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, and West Virginia. In comparison, the national average of college students that face food insecurity is approximately 12 percent. At some campuses surveyed, food insecurity levels were as high as 51.8 percent.

Over 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the survey. Researchers performed a statistical analysis of the responses using the US Department of Agriculture’s Adult Food Security Survey and other scales to assess money expenditure, coping strategies, and academic progress.

“We found that students who are food insecure had lower academic grades than those who did not face food insecurity,” says Marsha Spence, UT professor of public health nutrition and coauthor of the study. “These same students usually try to save money on other things to obtain food, such as spending less in transportation, utilities, and sometimes even medication.”

According to the study, several factors can predict food insecurity status: being a junior or a sophomore, having an ethnic minority background, receiving financial aid, and having reported poor health indicated a higher risk of food insecurity.

“This study is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests that a large percentage of college students, including students from four-year public institutions, are at risk of food insecurity,” said coauthor Elizabeth Anderson Steeves, professor in UT’s Department of Nutrition. “Studies like ours are important to understand food insecurity and its negative effects on students, so that universities can implement policies and programs to help alleviate this problem and help students succeed.”

“Studies like ours are important to understand food insecurity and its negative effects on students, so that universities can implement policies and programs to help alleviate this problem and help students succeed.”—CONTACT:Andrea Schneibel (865-974-3993, andrea.schneibel@utk.edu)"
121,121,"Dec 1, 2020",Civil Eats,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped from the USDA’s Food Box Program,"Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

“’Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes—part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program—came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers—giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce.

“When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers. They were just left out. There was a big void that was left,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director.

Despite Challenges, Program Helps Farmers, Families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers—a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss.

“Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit.

“This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale, Burkett said, because of an incredible upswelling of community support.

“Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” added the farmer. “It brought the community together.”","Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

122,122,"Dec 19, 2019",Center For American Progress,What It Looks Like To Be Hungry in College,"Over the past few years, the issue of food insecurity among college students has gained national attention—and with good reason. A study released earlier this year by the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice found that 48 percent of students at two-year institutions and 41 percent of students at four-year institutions experienced food insecurity during the 30 days preceding the survey.

A new study from Trellis Company provides policymakers and advocates further insight into what it looks like to be hungry while in college. The study defined low food security as a situation in which a student missed meals altogether or couldn’t afford a balanced meal. Over a nine-month period in 2017, Trellis Company followed 72 college students and found that 36 of them experienced food insecurity at some point. The study explored the lived experiences of these students; how they coped with the challenges of food insecurity; and how these circumstances influenced their academic performance.

The study’s findings should help inform policymakers and institutional leaders on how to support college students facing food insecurity. In particular, three significant insights emerged: Students are often reluctant to receive or seek help; food insecurity often fluctuates; and food insecurity can have a pervasive effect on students’ higher education experiences.

A reluctance to accept help

The study emphasizes that interventions designed to support hungry college students need to take into account that those students may be reluctant to seek out or accept help from their institution or other public or nonprofit resources. Many interviewed students didn’t consider their schools as sources of help for nonacademic needs such as food assistance, while some believed that these institutions should instead save resources for students who are in more desperate need. Other students described feeling that they were expected to project competence and responsibility and that taking food from a food pantry could hurt others’ perceptions of them.

Many students in the study also expressed reluctance to pursue public benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), often because they thought either that the application process is too much of a hassle or that they would not qualify. This concern isn’t unfounded: Just 18 percent of college students qualify for SNAP—and only 3 percent actually receive it. This has prompted lawmakers to propose legislation that would expand the program to address food insecurity among low-income college students. Only two students in the study who experienced low food security reported applying for SNAP benefits. One full-time student who is also a single parent had to weigh the possibility of being approved for benefits against the loss of a couple hours of wages to fill out the application.

Fluctuations in food insecurity

While one might assume that a student is either struggling to meet their basic needs or not, the Trellis Company study shows that food security—or lack thereof—is often a fluid condition. Over the course of the study, 26 participants endured a decline in their food security, while 30 participants experienced an improvement.

The most common reason underlying a decline in students’ food security was an unexpected expense such as a car repair, a speeding ticket, or health issues affecting themselves or a family member. Students who relied on family financial support were likewise affected by unexpected events in relatives’ lives such as a layoff, business hardship, health problems, or additional expenses.

College students also reported frequently having to cut their hours at their jobs to focus on studying. Some chose to quit their jobs while others were let go. Regardless of the reason, these challenges affected their finances and therefore their food security: A decline in a student’s financial security typically caused them to start eating irregularly or consuming lower-quality meals in an effort to reduce costs.

Additionally, students might experience improvements in food security because they received more financial help from friends or family; adhered to a strict budget; cooked at home; or, in rare cases, received help from SNAP benefits or additional financial aid. Certain changes in housing situations—usually students moving in with family or a partner—also alleviated pressure.

These circumstances demonstrate that just one small change in a student’s life can determine whether or not they are food secure. College officials should take these changing circumstances into account and ensure students are aware of their colleges’ financial resources such as emergency funds as well as receive clear information on accessing SNAP benefits.

A pervasive effect on students’ higher education experience

Food insecurity negatively affected the lives of students in the study both academically and socially.

Some food-insecure students reported having very little free time because they tried to earn as much money as they could by working long hours in addition to attending classes and studying. Tight finances also constrained social activities due to the costs involved, which the study said can “have direct academic implications” because social activities can provide a reprieve from stress and a sense of community. To avoid this problem, some students reported spending beyond their means to foster relationships, putting them at greater risk of food insecurity.

Students enduring financial and academic stress often reported losing sleep, eating poorly, and becoming ill—all of which are likely to affect their academic performance. Poor academic performance can have its own financial repercussions, as earning lower grades might result in losing a scholarship. One full-time student described what it was like to struggle with housing, food, and school at the same time:

I wouldn’t be able to focus or I would lose sleep, I would just be really anxious. And so I would be lying in bed trying to sleep and I couldn’t because I was stressing out about money or where I was gonna get it, and I wouldn’t be doing homework because I needed to sleep. And so, I would just be angry because I was wasting time being awake.

The study noted that “[w]hen students were able to become food secure, they often reported increased sleep, reduced stress, and higher levels of energy.” In other words, food security is directly related to students’ ability to thrive in college.

Conclusion

The authors of the Trellis Company study recommended that colleges be more attuned to students’ basic needs by, for example, improving financial aid and emergency aid; making academic schedules more accommodating for those who work; providing child care services; and training faculty and staff to watch for signs of poverty. They also recommended opening food pantries in prominent locations and making them available to all students in an effort to help destigmatize poverty. Finally, they suggested providing students with coaching and workshops to help them learn financial and food preparation skills, although some studies show that this approach has not proved effective in changing behaviors.

Certain policy reforms at the federal level—such as updating SNAP eligibility rules and clarifying eligibility requirements to accommodate more college students—would help alleviate food insecurity in college. More broadly, however, the prevalence of food insecurity among college students is a symptom of the increasing unaffordability of higher education in America. As CAP proposed in “Beyond Tuition,” policymakers must grapple with students’ living costs—including food and housing—in any effort to make college affordable. A system that allows college students to struggle with food insecurity as they try to focus on their studies shortchanges them of their opportunity to build a better life.

123,123,"Jun 29, 2018",Brookings Institution,Children’s exposure to food insecurity is still worse than it was before the Great Recession,"By many measures, the economy has recovered from the Great Recession. The unemployment rate is lower than it’s been in decades. In July 2017 the jobs gap, the number of jobs needed to return to the national employment rate prior to the Great Recession, accounting for population growth and aging, closed. In 2016, the poverty rate fell to 12.7 percent—nearly the same as its pre-recession levels.

But, another important indicator of economic health, food insecurity, remains elevated over pre-recession rates despite the best labor market in more than a decade.

A household is food insecure if it does not have consistent access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources. The share of households experiencing food insecurity is continuing to recover from its recession-era peak of 14.9 percent, and in 2016 fell to 12.3 percent. That is still above its pre-recession level of 11.1 percent.

The debate about SNAP during Farm Bill reauthorization has focused on adults; but, 43 percent of SNAP beneficiaries are households with children. Children are exposed to higher rates of food insecurity than the population overall. During the summer, school-age children lose access to school-provided breakfast and lunch and SNAP benefits do not adjust to account for this.

At the national level, the share of food insecure households with children is 16.5 percent—still above the 2007 pre-recession level of 15.8 percent but well below the Great Recession peak of 21.3 in 2009. 12.9 million children lived in food insecure households in 2016.

Furthermore, 4.8 percent of households with children had very low food security in 2016, meaning that food intake was reduced and normal eating patterns were disrupted because the household lacked money and other resources for food.

National trends conceal even higher levels of food insecurity for many states. In this piece, we provide an update of rates of child exposure to food insecurity and very low food security in the states. In only two states – Colorado and South Carolina – were the share of children living in households with food insecurity and very low food security lower in 2014-16 than in 2005-07. In 23 states the share of children living in food insecure households was statistically significantly higher than just prior to the Great Recession.

The state-level picture

Every state has more than 10 percent of children living in food insecure households.[1] Nonetheless, states vary widely in the degree to which its children are exposed to food insecurity. In 16 states, more than one-in-five children live in food insecure households. In four states – Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico – more than one-in-four children live in food insecure households.

While the share of children living in households with food insecurity has continued to fall in the national numbers, only four states are doing statistically significantly better than pre-recession levels (2005-07 to 2014-16). Far out in front is Iowa, which has seen a more than 25 percent reduction in the share of children living in food-insecure households from 2005-07 to 2014-16. In 23 states, the shares of children living in food-insecure households is statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that these states are back to pre-recession levels.

Almost half of states had a rate of children living in food-insecure households in 2014-16 that was statistically significantly higher than in 2005-07. Connecticut, Delaware, and New Mexico’s share of children living in food-insecure households increased by almost 50 percent; in Alabama the rate almost doubled.

In almost half of states more than 6 percent of children lived in households with very low food security. Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico had the highest rates of food insecurity and were also at or near the top of the distribution of the share of children living in households with very low food security. In addition, in Rhode Island, Maine, Nebraska, Connecticut, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Nevada more than 7 percent of children lived in households with very low food security.

Child exposure to very low food security was statistically significantly higher in 21 states in 2014-16 compared with 2005-07. In 2014-16, the share of children living in households with very low food security remained double (Rhode Island, North Dakota), triple (Nebraska, New Mexico), and quadruple (Alabama, New Hampshire) pre-recession levels. Only four states had a statistically significant reductions in the share of children living in households with very low food security in 2014-16 compared with 2005-07: South Carolina, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi. For the remaining 25 states and the District of Columbia, the percent of children living in households with very low food security in 2014-16 are indistinguishable from 2005-07.

These rates of food insecurity and very low food security are snapshots taken during the school year. As we have written, during the summer, children from food insecure households have less consistent access to food. A recent US Department of Agriculture demonstration project found that providing families with an extra $60 per month during the summer reduced household rates of food insecurity by 15 percent and very low food security by one-third. To reduce exposure to food insecurity and very low food security among children, Congress should consider increasing SNAP benefit levels, especially to households with children.","A household is food insecure if it does not have consistent access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources.

125,125,"Sep 1, 2020",talkbusiness.net,Data confirms Delta region one of the hardest hit by COVID-19,"Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. One region, often cited as the most impoverished in the country according to economic metrics, the Mississippi Delta Region, has been hit particularly hard, according to data collected by the Delta Grassroots Caucus.

“The Delta continues to suffer seriously from the pandemic and a strong recovery is still not here. A collection of data from across the region indicate the need for a strong economic stimulus from federal, state and private sector sources. An overly rosy depiction of the Delta’s economy is counterproductive because we need to admit we still have a severe problem in order to solve it,” said Lee Powell, Caucus director.

Four of the top counties in Arkansas in terms of high unemployment include Chicot (13.6%), Mississippi (12.6%), Phlllips (11.8%) and Crittenden (11.6%). Craighead County (7.7%) remained the lone bright spot in terms of economic metrics in the region.

Other key findings from the compilation include:

Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana had the four highest rates of food insecurity based on a Feeding America survey. The Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research found the highest food insecurity levels were in Mississippi (31.6%) and Louisiana (30.1%), with Arkansas the fifth highest at 25.9%.

A survey of the University of Arkansas Department of Sociology and Criminology found that Arkansas and other Southern and mid-Southern states had elevated levels of food insecurity due to COVID-19. In the category of “reduced quality, desirability or variety of diet,” the four worst rates were all from “Greater Delta Region” states: Alabama (47.7%), Arkansas (47.4%), Tennessee (45.1%) and Kentucky (44%).

A University of Louisiana at Lafayette report found that job losses in Louisiana were virtually twice as high in the pandemic as compared with after Hurricane Katrina – by 11% in the first half of this year, as compared with a 6% drop after Katrina in 2005. Louisiana’s gross domestic product contraction of 6% was one of the five sharpest drops among all states.

An Illinois Municipal League survey found that 87% of municipalities expected a substantial revenue shortfall due to the pandemic. Many communities advised that they will need greater assistance from federal and state governments. The Southern Illinois Delta area chronically fares worse than the statewide economic figures for Illinois.

ALREADY VULNERABLE

The Delta economy was vulnerable due to many small businesses that were struggling even before the pandemic. Many have closed or have not come back yet, and many low-income people who did not have large savings to see them through a downturn are struggling financially, the data reflects.

The region’s diverse population with many African Americans and some other minorities has been hit harder by both higher virus infection rates and more economic losses, with minority women being especially hard hit because women suffered the largest job losses and as minorities they have higher virus infection rates; and the region’s economy had major manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors that have been hit disproportionately by the recession.

Harvey Joe Sanner, president of American Ag Movement of Arkansas in Des Arc, said “the situation is bleak.”

“Our job situation is worsening. as one of our large employers in Lonoke, Remmington Arms is laying off workers… I think most people feel that our situation, both health-wise and economically, will get worse before it gets better,” Sanner said.

Millie Atkins, Delta Caucus senior adviser and veteran Delta regional advocate based in Monroe, La., said the organization will seek federal relief.

“This pandemic has shed a great light on the many economic, social and educational inequities in a number of areas where the Delta was vulnerable such as the large number of job losses, the many low-income jobs that made it difficult for people to accumulate savings that could see them through a downturn, the small business closures that have not come back yet,” she said.

Powell said the Delta Grassroots Caucus will advocate for a continuing strong stimulus package at the annual Delta conference on Oct. 13-14, 2020, which will largely be conducted by Zoom webinar due to the coronavirus. Delta Caucus partners across the region are calling for a strong economic stimulus and safety net package to jump-start the region’s economy. Suggestions for a policy package include continuing larger unemployment benefits and strong federal and state economic stimulus packages to deal with unprecedented job losses.

The Caucus will seek a 15% increase in SNAP and other nutrition benefit programs during the pandemic – although SNAP is primarily an anti-hunger program, it also has an economic stimulus impact, with every $1 spent on SNAP generating $1.70 in economic benefits. The Caucus will ask for a major infrastructure expansion program to create jobs, repair deteriorating infrastructure, and stimulate the economy.

The Caucus will seek funding for Job creation and retention programs through tax incentives for investing in economically distressed areas. It will ask for maintaining education and workforce development programs during the pandemic, which will require a major broadband access expansion initiative through programs such as USDA’s Rural Re-Connect high-speed broadband program and state programs like Arkansas’ Rural Connect (ARC).","Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
One region, often cited as the most impoverished in the country according to economic metrics, the Mississippi Delta Region, has been hit particularly hard, according to data collected by the Delta Grassroots Caucus.
A collection of data from across the region indicate the need for a strong economic stimulus from federal, state and private sector sources.
Millie Atkins, Delta Caucus senior adviser and veteran Delta regional advocate based in Monroe, La., said the organization will seek federal relief.

OXFORD, Miss. – Entering its 10th year of operations, the North Mississippi VISTA Project has made significant strides toward poverty alleviation, capacity building, sustainable solutions and community empowerment in north Mississippi.

The project’s 148 yearlong VISTA members and 145 VISTA summer associates represent a $7.1 million investment of human capital in the region.

Since 2010, NMVP has placed full-time VISTA members to serve yearlong and summer terms at partner organizations based on the University of Mississippi campus and in communities across a 28-county area. Housed at the McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement, NMVP is a key community partnership initiative in the institute’s work to fight poverty and transform lives through education, innovation and entrepreneurship.

With the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities already struggling with disparities in health, income and educational access, the work of NMVP has taken on a greater urgency.

“It is an honor to lead the North Mississippi VISTA Project at a time when communities are mobilizing COVID response and recovery efforts,” said Emily Echols, project manager with the McLean Institute. “VISTA members build capacity for programs that support academic gains, financial stability, housing security and food security.

“There is a heightened urgency around this work right now, and NMVP allows the University of Mississippi to fulfill its public purpose during the pandemic.”

VISTA members commit to one year of national service, focusing on building sustainable capacity within community-based organizations and delivering a measurable impact on the populations they serve. VISTAs work to manage and recruit volunteers; create programs that foster growth in literacy and math; develop content to promote financial literacy; foster social entrepreneurship; raise funds through grant writing, special events and campaigns; and raise the profile of their host sites through social media outreach.

“Serving as a VISTA member with the Minority PUL Alliance and as a VISTA leader has been a tremendous opportunity for me to grow as a nonprofit and community engagement professional,” said VISTA leader Adriana Cooper, of Blue Mountain. “The NMVP network is improving lives across north Mississippi, and it’s exciting to be a part of that work as our project builds momentum.”

The 2020-21 grant represents an investment of nearly $600,000 in the region. During the 2020-21 program year, 20 yearlong VISTA members will build the capacity of poverty alleviation efforts at the following locations:

Boys and Girls Club of Lexington (Holmes County)

But God Ministries (Coahoma County)

Doors of Hope (Lafayette County)

Griot Arts (Coahoma County)

Higher Purpose Co. (Coahoma County)

LOU Reads (Lafayette County)

Minority PUL Alliance (Lee County)

Operation Fit Nation (Lafayette County)

Oxford Community Market (Lafayette County)

Pontotoc County School District (Pontotoc County)

Rust College Community Development Corporation (Marshall County)

Tallahatchie Arts Council (Union County)

Union County Heritage Museum (Union County)

Yoknapatawpha Arts Council (Lafayette County)

Center for Math and Science Education (UM campus)

Luckyday Residential College (UM campus)

School of Education (UM campus)

Recruitment efforts are underway to fill five remaining yearlong positions.

“The contributions of VISTA members can be transformative for organizations,” said Laura Martin, associate director of the McLean Institute. “In the past year alone, members of NMVP raised over $291,000 for their organizations, supervised over 700 volunteers and reached over 900 beneficiaries through educational programs, mentorship, financial literacy, housing support and referrals to alleviate long-term hunger.

“These impacts, in turn, transform individual lives and communities.”

Many members of NMVP have gone on to pursue additional education to promote the public good and to launch careers in higher education and the nonprofit sector.

Denae Bradley graduated from UM in 2016 with a degree in psychology and a minor in African American studies. As a program development VISTA with the UM Office of Sustainability from 2016 to 2017, Bradley deepened community-campus partnerships around food security and access to local produce.

She completed a master’s degree in sociology at UM in 2019 and is a doctoral student in sociology at Howard University, where her research centers on reproductive health care for incarcerated women.

“The VISTA project is central to the McLean Institute’s efforts to transform lives and build social capital to improve quality of life,” said Albert Nylander, professor of sociology and director of the McLean Institute.

“We remain grateful for the opportunity to lead NMVP and for the continued investment of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Office of the Provost, the College of Liberal Arts and the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in these partnerships.”","– Entering its 10th year of operations, the North Mississippi VISTA Project has made significant strides toward poverty alleviation, capacity building, sustainable solutions and community empowerment in north Mississippi.

127,127,"Aug 5, 2020",USA TODAY,COVID-19 has left millions of Americans without enough food. Here's how Senate can help.,"CLOSE The US recently topped 4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and now has reached another unenviable milestone. USA TODAY

Today’s environment is unlike anything our nation has ever experienced. We are on the brink of an economic and food security disaster

As a nation, we have a moral and economic obligation to address child hunger, food insecurity and avoid economic collapse in the wake of COVID-19. While we have different political viewpoints, we strongly agree that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is one of the most effective tools we have to fight the looming health and economic crises facing our great country.

The Senate is at a critical decision point as to how we use this tool. That’s why together, we are calling for a temporary 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits, bound to economic indicators, in the next federal coronavirus relief package.

Even in the best of economic times, far too many Americans struggle to put food on the table. This is especially concerning for families, where children need nutritious food to grow up healthy and strong.

Today’s environment is unlike anything our nation has ever experienced. We are on the brink of an economic and food security disaster that will impact every citizen, but disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals including children, the elderly, rural Americans, Black, indigenous and people of color.

Communities of color are particularly hard hit by coronavirus, forcing local food banks to feed more with less as need increases all over the country. (Photo: USAT)

For years, the number of hungry children was declining. But, a new Save the Children report shows that many children now face even greater risk. New estimates from Northwestern University based on Census Bureau data indicate the percentage of families who are considered food insecure has increased during the pandemic, is much higher than during the Great Recession, and, of great concern, disproportionately affect children and families of color.

Rural communities hit hard

The situation is particularly stark in rural communities. Even before the pandemic, Feeding America data showed that nearly 90 percent of the counties with the highest percentage of children at risk of going hungry were rural. Kentucky, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Nevada and North Carolina will be hit hardest by growing food insecurity in the wake of the pandemic, according to new projections.

Children such as Emma and Devan from rural Kentucky relied on meals served at school. Their great-great-grandmother Claudette, who is raising the kids, didn’t realize how much milk and bread her children go through in a week. She doesn’t have reliable transportation to get to the grocery store about 30 miles away, and because of her age, she falls into a higher-risk category should she contract COVID-19.

Since the closures, their family has benefited from food distributions and meal deliveries by school bus. Stress, in addition to hunger, is certainly rising in rural pockets across America, with schools going into the red to fill the feeding gap.

During normal times, America could turn to stopgaps like food banks and other feeding initiatives to supplement federal nutrition programs. Despite additional support in the CARES Act, the unprecedented need stemming from this pandemic has already strained existing resources and programs, with no end in sight.

Charities can't keep up with needs

Save the Children has helped serve rural children more than 1.8 million meals from the end of March through May. Yet, reports of staggering, miles-long lines at food pantries show that we simply cannot expect hunger relief organizations or schools to meet the need alone.

We do not know how long the economic damage of the pandemic will last. SNAP can and should be part of the solution — putting resources directly and immediately into the wallets of Americans. A temporary 15 percent increase in the SNAP maximum allotment level would equate to an additional $25 per person per month.

Every dollar in SNAP benefits generates about $1.54 in economic activity. Increased spending on food enabled by SNAP supports essential businesses small and large, stimulates local economies and helps to support American farmers.

Of note, SNAP infrastructure already exists and stands ready to immediately distribute benefits directly to those who are eligible. Working within an existing program avoids the high costs and long delays associated with standing up a new program.

SNAP’s strict eligibility requirements prevent benefits from going to those who are not truly in need and ensure that no one who needs and wants the help is inadvertently left out.

Preventing children from going hungry, implementing smart, efficient policy solutions and supporting economic security for millions of Americans are common ground issues, no matter your political party. We come from different backgrounds, have different political beliefs and have different views on a host of policy issues, but on this, we are aligned and in lock step, because we know it’ll help kids like Emma and Devan.

Temporarily boosting SNAP by 15 percent is one tool that’s readily available to immediately keep American children from going hungry and shield them from the worst economic impacts of COVID-19. We urge Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Chuck Schumer and their fellow senators to use it.

Dr. Bill Frist is a heart transplant surgeon, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader and a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He co-chaired the policy center's SNAP Task Force, which published “Leading with Nutrition: Leveraging Federal Programs for Better Health.”

Mark K. Shriver is senior vice president of U.S. Programs and Advocacy at Save the Children. In June, Save the Children released ""The Land of Inopportunity: Closing the Childhood Equity Gap for America’s Kids,"" which features county-level rankings for child well-being, including food insecurity.

Charles “Hunt” Walne (Photo by Logan Kirkland)

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A Mississippi State graduate student is being recognized this year as a Future Leader in Science, an honor bestowed by the agronomy tri-societies—the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America and Soil Science Society of America.

Charles “Hunt” Walne, an MSU agronomy doctoral student in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, earlier this year was one of 18 graduate students chosen as a recipient of the Future Leader in Science award and invited to the tri-societies’ annual Congressional Visits Day at the U.S. Capitol to advocate the importance of federal funding for agricultural research to Mississippi legislators.

In keeping with the United Nations General Assembly having named 2020 the “International Year of Plant Health,” the Collierville, Tennessee native also was invited to the Capitol event to present research conducted by K. Raja Reddy—Walne’s major professor—about crop performance in projected future climates. This work was made possible using the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station’s unique Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research Facility, known as the SPAR unit.

Reddy, a research professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences and MAFES scientist, discussed why Walne’s recognition is a testament to his exemplary dedication to the field of agricultural research as a whole.

“I had the opportunity to mentor Hunt starting from junior year of his undergraduate studies and now serve as his major professor as he pursues his doctoral degree. Hunt understands the big picture of the issues related to food security at the national and global levels and how his interest in research and leadership can help shape policy decisions now and in the future,” Reddy said.

Walne served as team leader during the national event, leading discussion with policymakers about the importance of funding for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative as well as funding for the Agriculture Advanced Research Development Authority, two competitive grants that focus on advancing agricultural research and education.

“Everyone we spoke with was receptive. Congressional members understand the importance of this,” he said.

Walne said while agricultural research garners support on both sides of the aisle, the Congressional Visits Day is an opportunity for leaders to focus on the need for a safe, plentiful food supply.

“These events serve as a bridge between policymakers and agricultural experts,” Walne said. “It’s important that there’s a space for researchers and scientists to share what they know and explain why it’s vital to continue the progress made in producing food and fiber to feed and clothe a growing population.”

“We wouldn’t be able to conduct the research we do at universities if it weren’t for the support we receive from our federal government. I’m proud to have had the chance to represent Mississippi State and advocate for research funding, not only for our university but for the agricultural research sector in general,” Walne said.

129,129,3 weeks ago,Scott County Times,SALTER:China trade standoff resolution is critical for Mississippi farmers seeking vital markets,"Below is an opinion column by Sid Salter:

For Mississippi farmers, the transition between the administrations of former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden could not be more impactful on any topic more so than in agricultural trade with China.

China is the third leading trading partner for Mississippi exports behind Canada and Mexico, with $759 million in value in 2020 – with that number representing a 63.8 percent increase over the previous year. That grow came after 2018-2019 tariffs standoff between China and the Trump administration led to hundreds of millions in lost export revenues to Mississippi producers.

A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018. The same study found that in 2018, trade with China supported 64,000 Mississippi jobs – which highlighted the need for China to abide by the commitments under the “phase one” trade agreements.

Writing in Foreign Policy on Oct. 27, 2020, Clark Packard framed the U.S. China trade standoff succinctly: “Trump’s aggressive trade war with China took things from bad to worse for U.S. farmers. Over the course of about 18 months, Washington and Beijing engaged in a back-and-forth volley of escalating trade restrictions, including Chinese retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,000 categories of U.S. agricultural products such as pork, soybeans, dairy products, and nuts.

“In January 2020, the two sides signed a detente, but it’s only a temporary reprieve to a conflict that continues to fester and is likely to resurface in the near future. As part of the so-called phase one agreement, Beijing agreed to purchase about $32 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products over two years,” he observed.

Why should this matter to Mississippians? China’s path to superpower status is blocked most readily by their struggle to produce enough food to feed its own 1.4 billion population and also influence and alleviate regional concerns over hunger and food insecurity.

China has been able in recent years to produce rice and wheat sufficient to meet the nation’s needs, but still must import soybeans and corn as feedstuffs sufficient to satisfy the population’s growing taste for meat.

Not only is China’s massive population problematic in producing hunger and food insecurity issues, but pollution, water aquifer depletion, and the impacts of climate change are also threatening future internal abilities to feed that nation and her allies. The loyalty of regional neighbor nations dependent on food aid also remains in the balance moving forward.

In reaction to the U.S.-China trade standoff, Mississippi (along with Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska) in 2019 cut a trade deal with Taiwan for them to import about $2 billion in soybeans and corn in 2020 and 2021.

But prior to the trade war, about 80 percent of the state’s soybean production was being sold to China. Under Biden’s new Secretary of Agriculture, initial reports are that China is living up to most of its pledges on the “phase one” trade deal. That deal called for China to buy $12.5 billion in American agriculture products in 2020 and another $19.5 billion in 2021.

Vilsack blames the COVID-19 pandemic as an obstacle to China’s meeting the deal but says he’s optimistic and with apparent evidence on his side. Politico reports that U.S. farm exports are projected to hit a record $31.5 billion during Biden’s first year in office – some $4.5 billion than projected in November 2020.

Mississippi farmers producing soybeans and corn hope those projections are accurate and that Biden’s national security and trade advisors can restore American access to vital Chinese markets.

Despite global concerns over the future of shipping, trade and maritime security issues in the South China Sea, it remains advantageous for China to keep imports of food and feed grains coming to supplement what they can’t successfully produce on their own.

Before the Trump trade wars, two of every three Mississippi soybeans were sold to China. Mississippi farmers would like to see that trade relationship restored.","A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018.

(DTN\Progressive Farmer photo by Becky Mills)

Every five years, a long and, one would have to believe, expensive process, ensues where a lengthy list of people with PhDs and MDs behind their names work on a report that will be the foundation for Dietary Guidelines for the next five years.

This year's report is 835 pages. Using all of this data, a new, formal set of Dietary Guidelines is expected to be released next month. For the first time ever, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee expanded recommendations to include children ages 12 to 24 months, and also considered the impact of food insecurity on Americans' health.

Reviewing the Committee's executive summary, the bad news comes early. This is the news we as Americans pretty much ignore. To put it in a nutshell, we are fat (70% overweight or obese) and we are sick (6 in 10 have one chronic condition; 4 in 10 have two or more chronic conditions). Add to this, food insecurity and a lack of access to affordable and heathy food.

Using 2018 data, the Committee reports more than 37 million people (6 million of them children) live in households that were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food to meet their needs. In 2020, is that number higher given the COVID-19 crisis and unemployment figures?

The Committee notes it began work in March 2019, and when it submitted its report the country was in the midst of the pandemic. The group noted this and said that as more is learned about the infection ""it is clear that it has significant nutritional implications."" Those most at risk for serious outcomes, noted the report, are those afflicted by diet-related chronic diseases.

""Finally, throughout the world, the consequences of physical isolation and financial disruption by the threat of COVID-19 infection has led to significant increases in food insecurity and hunger, furthering increasing susceptibility to both infectious and diet-related chronic disease,"" noted the Committee's Chair, Barbara Schneeman; and vice chair, Ronald Kleinman.

Some key takeaways from the report with regards to what we should eat and how this might affect chronic illnesses, including cancer and cardiovascular disease, follow. These are not yet formal recommendations, but they will likely be the foundation of coming guidelines.

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION

Pregnant women should consume at least 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week, making choices that are lower in methylmercury and higher in Omega-3 fatty acids. Folic acid supplementation was associated with a better ""maternal folate status"" during pregnancy and reduced risk of hypertensive disorders among women at high risk or with a previous history of these disorders. Some limited evidence suggested supplementation with Omega-3 fatty acids could lead to ""favorable cognitive development in children"".

BIRTH TO AGE 24 MONTHS

Nutritional exposures in the first 1,000 days of life contribute to long-term health, but also help shape taste preferences and food choices. Evidence suggested human milk feeding may be related to infant fatty acid status, depending on maternal diet. The Committee supported recommendations for lactating women to consume food sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as fish.","For the first time the Dietary Guidelines Committee expanded its recommendations to children 12-to-24-months, calling for consumption of nutrient-rich foods, including animal-source foods.

133,133,1 month ago,Today.com,SNAP expansion and worker safety: How Biden's executive orders affect the food world,"President Joe Biden has signed multiple executive orders since being sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Jan. 20, just over a week ago.

Many of have focused on aid to help the country cope with the coronavirus pandemic, while more recent orders have focused on racial equity and climate change.

Several of the orders will have impacts on the food world, the workers in food industries and on food insecurity, which is at record-high levels amid the pandemic.

Expansion of food assistance programs

On Jan. 22, Biden signed an executive order that aims to expand food assistance programs and increase the amount of aid people are eligible for.

In early January, under former president Donald J. Trump, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit allotments were increased by 15% for the first six months of 2021. Biden's executive order seeks to extend that period through September.

The order also aims to allow states to increase SNAP emergency benefits for those most in need: The Trump administration allowed all families not currently receiving the maximum monthly benefit to receive that amount, but very low-income households that were already receiving the maximum monthly benefit did not see any increase. The Biden executive order called for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to seek out options to give these families an increase, something Feeding America Managing Director of Policy Robert Campbell said was encouraging.

""About 37% of SNAP households who were already at that maximum benefit level saw no increase in their food assistance because of the (Trump administration's) interpretation,"" Campbell told TODAY Food. ""By design, those 37% are the households with the lowest incomes … They don't have any of their own resources to contribute towards food for their families. … We want to make sure that those with the lowest incomes who are struggling the most are not left out.""

The executive order also asks the USDA to re-examine the underlying SNAP benefit formula, which Campbell said doesn't correctly indicate the current cost of a nutritious diet.

""What this does is ask USDA to go back and look at what they call their Thrifty Food Plan, which is the basis that underlies base net benefits,"" he said. ""It's more than 30 years old, it makes a whole lot of assumptions that we think are far outdated for how individuals prepare their food, the types of food they purchase. … A lot of evidence and research shows it needs to be updated. By doing so, we hope it'll better reflect the benefits that households need.""

Another part of the order focuses on the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT), which helps low-income families with school-age children by providing them with food dollars equivalent to the value of meals missed due to COVID-19–related closures of schools, daycares and other facilities. Campbell said the program's current cap is low, $5.86 per child per school day, but the executive order will raise that cap by approximately 15%.

Protections for worker health and safety

Other executive orders from the Biden administration seek to ensure that workers stay safe amid the pandemic, which could have an impact on those working in places like restaurants, grocery stores and meatpacking plants.

While the executive order, issued on Jan. 21, does not place any immediate obligations on private companies, it directs the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue new guidance for workplaces within the next two weeks, in consultation with other appropriate federal agencies, and increase enforcement of that guidance.

OSHA is also being asked to consider whether ""emergency temporary workplace safety standards on COVID-19 are necessary."" If those standards are found to be necessary, they must be issued by March 15. The agency is also being told to focus enforcement efforts on ""violations that put the largest number of workers at risk of COVID-19"" and ensure equity in enforcement.

The agency has also been instructed to ""conduct a multilingual effort"" informing workers of their rights in the workplace.

Unemployment insurance for those leaving unsafe workplaces

In an executive order signed on Jan. 22, Biden asked that the Department of Labor consider clarifying rules regarding the ""federally guaranteed right"" of workers to ""refuse employment that will jeopardize their health"" while still being eligible to receiving unemployment insurance.

According to CNBC, most workers can't refuse ""suitable work"" and still collect unemployment insurance. Suitable work is considered a job that matches your skill set and pays a similar rate to previous employment. During the pandemic, that definition changed, and states and local governments were allowed to make their own determinations of what constituted a ""safe work environment."" Biden's executive order, paired with the order protecting worker health and safety, hopes to provide one federal standard.

Workers will still have to prove that their work environment places their health at risk and that they have asked their employer to enforce an ""improved standard,"" CNBC reported. Workers will also have to show that employers chose not to act on recommended health and safety guidance from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A ""general fear of contracting the virus"" is not considered cause to refuse suitable work.

Dr. Siby Sekou, the president and CEO of ROC United, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of restaurant employees, said that the executive order will make it safer for food workers to do their jobs.

""These guidelines establish a clear link between health, safety and economic justice,"" he told TODAY, adding that he hopes the new orders will keep workers from being retaliated against if they report unsafe behavior by their employers. ""It is really important for workers to be able to take care of their families financially when they feel like they are at risk of getting sick or getting their families sick.""

Order affecting speed in chicken processing plants

Another action by Biden, this one signed on Jan. 25, withdrew a Trump administration request that would have raised the maximum speed at which chicken processing plants can operate.

Currently, slaughterhouses process 140 birds per minute, and in 2018, the Trump administration gave waivers to 54 poultry plants allowing them to increase that number to 175 birds per minute. The Trump administration request would have extended that increase to all poultry plants.

A Washington Post investigation found that plants that had waivers allowing them to process 175 birds per minute were 10 times likelier to have coronavirus cases.

Biden's executive order does not revoke existing waivers but will prevent plants without waivers from increasing their production speed to more than 140 birds per minute.

100-day pause on deportations

One of Biden's first executive orders was a 100-day pause on deportations of undocumented immigrants; it's estimated that at least 50% of the workforce in the farm work and meat processing industries is undocumented.

Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. Programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said that this likely won't have a major impact, since arrests and deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had dropped during the pandemic, and there hasn't been a large-scale raid on a workplace since August 2019.

""A lot of these meatpacking plants and food processing plants are in fairly rural areas where ICE doesn't have a huge presence,"" Capps told TODAY. ""Excepting those really unusual large operations, there haven't been large ICE arrests in those areas.""

Biden has also changed ICE priorities, focusing on undocumented immigrants who have committed an aggravated felony, making the scope for any potential deportations much narrower.

"" … We're starting from a point where there's already low activity, and then what they're (doing) is resetting, basically, back to where things were at the end of the Obama administration,"" said Capps. ""That's basically saying that the vast majority of the unauthorized immigrant population is off-limits.""","President Joe Biden has signed multiple executive orders since being sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Jan. 20, just over a week ago.
Several of the orders will have impacts on the food world, the workers in food industries and on food insecurity, which is at record-high levels amid the pandemic.
Biden's executive order seeks to extend that period through September.
The executive order also asks the USDA to re-examine the underlying SNAP benefit formula, which Campbell said doesn't correctly indicate the current cost of a nutritious diet.
Biden's executive order, paired with the order protecting worker health and safety, hopes to provide one federal standard."

OXFORD, Miss. – Rebecca Henry, a student in the University of Mississippi‘s Coordinated Program in Dietetics, recently came in second in the master’s category during the Three-Minute Thesis competition hosted by the UM Graduate School.

Her research examined a food education and food security intervention with the Calhoun City High School football team to determine whether food education increased the players’ nutrition knowledge.

Henry conducted the research, funded by the UM Foundation’s Food and Nutrition Security Support fund, through the Office of Food and Nutrition Security under the direction of David H. Holben, professor of nutrition, Gillespie Distinguished Scholar and OFNS director.

“What we presented was that the food education program did significantly increase their sport nutrition knowledge,” Henry said. “We concluded that it’s warranted, that nutrition education should be incorporated into sports in high school. There’s absolutely a great need there, for sure.”

Henry, a recent recipient of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation General Scholarship, attended the academy’s annual conference in Philadelphia, where she presented her poster from the Fueling Fitness study. She also attended conference sessions focusing on pediatric dietetics.

“I went to several of the talks – educational sessions from dietitians that work in children’s hospitals, NICUs and in other settings that do research, especially in that NICU population,” she said. “I think that I probably would continue doing research, but likely more in quality improvement.”

Henry is regarded highly by Yunhee Chang, associate professor and graduate program director in the Department of Nutrition and Hospitality Management.

“Rebecca Henry is definitely one of the brightest students we’ve had in our program,” Chang said. “She is a strong student the classroom, as well as during her professional training in the community. It seems that excellence is in her nature.

“She is the type of student who scores 120 in the exams because while she is gifted, she keeps a humble attitude about learning. I am looking forward to seeing her making differences in people’s lives and becoming a leader in our profession.”

As part of the coordinated program, Henry is serving an internship at Traceway Retirement Center in Tupelo, doing clinical rotations.

“Seeing how it differs from acute clinical in a hospital setting versus long-term care has been really interesting to me, as well as seeing a shift in focus from short-term outcomes to more long-term outcomes and quality of life,” Henry said.

Henry knew she would ultimately end up working with children, even as an undergraduate, and hopes to go into pediatrics in the dietetics field. For three weeks in October, she participated in rotations at Batson Children’s Hospital in Jackson, spending one week in the NICU, one week in the pediatric in-patient clinic and one week in outpatient clinics.

“I really didn’t know what I wanted to do,” Henry said. “I just knew that I loved nutrition and I wanted to help attain a higher quality of life. As I’ve kind of gotten further into my study into supervised practice now, I want to make the biggest impact that I can, and I personally think that that is intervening at the earliest possible stages.

“So that’s where pediatrics comes in for me. There is something so special about it when I was down there at Batson, and it is just so touching. … It just kind of ignited an extra spark in me.”

STARKVILLE, Miss.—A senior official with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations discussed the significant global impacts the agency is having during a Monday [Oct. 7] lecture at Mississippi State University.

Daniel Gustafson, FAO deputy director-general for programmes, shared from his experience facilitating large-scale FAO projects aimed at achieving sustainable development goals and global food security. He also highlighted the roles FAO and the United Nations play in crisis mitigation and supporting displaced people. The speech was part of the Global Engagement Lecture Series sponsored by the MSU International Institute.

Gustafson noted that FAO is interested in understanding the impacts of voluntary migration and forced migration, which is usually caused by conflict, climate shocks or economic issues. In recent decades, migration across countries has continued to increase.

“The UN projects 66 percent of the global population to be urban by 2050, which creates a massive need for urban employment,” Gustafson said, adding that food supply chains represent one area of employment growth potential.

In addition to impacting migration, crises have continued to play a significant role in food security issues, as most countries with dire food needs are countries with ongoing conflicts, Gustafson said. As international food systems become more complex, Gustafson complimented MSU’s interdisciplinary focus in addressing global challenges.

“Food security is often under a ministry of agriculture, nutrition under a minister of health, gender issues are often with a women’s ministry,” Gustafson said. “The problems are so interconnected that they have to have an interdisciplinary approach.”

MSU has a long-standing relationship with the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, with research partnerships focused on food safety, nutrition, aquatic animal health and agriculture, among other areas. The FAO and the World Food Programme have recognized MSU as a Center for Knowledge for Aquatic Health. MSU President Mark E. Keenum, who holds an MSU doctoral degree in agricultural economics and who served as Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has made global food security a university research priority during his tenure at MSU.

MSU alumnus Richard A. Rula also will be awarded an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree during Starkville’s 1:30 p.m. April 30 ceremony for lifetime achievements and longtime major support of university programs. Rula, who earned a 1970 civil engineering degree from MSU’s Bagley College of Engineering, currently serves as president of Ridgeland-based Hemphill Construction Company, one of the Southeast’s leading multi-faceted contractors. He also has served on the boards of the MSU Foundation and the Bulldog Club, among others.

Rula was recognized as one of the Bagley college’s Distinguished Engineering Fellows in 2006 and its Alumnus of the Year in 2017. In 2019, he was recognized as the university’s National Alumnus of the Year. Rula and his wife Sherry provided the lead gift for MSU’s new Engineering and Science Complex, which is nearing completion and will be named in his honor. They also have endowed the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, which will be officially named the Richard A. Rula School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

The Rulas’ generous support also has had a major impact on the MSU student-athlete experience. They provided the lead gift for the Rula Tennis Pavilion, the new indoor complex for MSU men’s and women’s tennis teams, and also have supported the Mize Pavilion’s courts for MSU men’s and women’s basketball.

University leaders planning for the ceremonies said many elements of past graduations will be the same this spring; however, ongoing guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic are requiring several adjustments to the conventional program. An entrance processional for graduates will not be included, but all graduates will walk across the stage as they are announced and congratulated. Graduates will leave in successive order after being recognized instead of returning to their seats. Likewise, guests should leave after their graduate is recognized.

All graduates, guests and employees are expected to conduct self-screening prior to leaving home. Per MSU guidelines, this includes an “at-home” temperature check and review of potential COVID-19 symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, muscle pains, sore throat, and a new loss of taste or smell. Anyone with any of these symptoms or a fever of greater than 100.4 degrees should stay home.

ANKENY, Iowa (DTN) -- The world will lose about 250 million crop production acres by 2050, according to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

The possibility of losing the equivalent of roughly two-thirds of the cultivated land in the United States is alarming, said Jerry Hatfield. But the director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment in Ames, Iowa, believes it can be prevented.

Hatfield said urbanization and soil degradation, from excessive tillage and other farming practices, are largely to blame for lost farm and ranch lands. People worldwide need to protect farm and ranch lands to feed a growing population, he said.

If society doesn't do a better job making land-use decisions and taking care of the soil, Hatfield is afraid hunger and food insecurity will be much more prevalent in 30 years when the world's population is expected to top 9 billion.

""If we look at the projected needs for food, feed and fiber, the productivity per unit of land is really going to have to increase,"" Hatfield said. ""To improve the stability of agriculture production going forward, we will have to improve and protect our soils.""

The American Farmland Trust (AFT), a non-profit organization committed to the protection of farmland, released ""Farms Under Threat: The State of the States"" earlier this year. The multi-year study identifies farm and ranchland acres lost to development and ways to protect it.

From 2001-2016, 11 million acres of agricultural land were paved over, converted or fragmented, according to the study.

138,138,"May 9, 2018",HealthPayerIntelligence.com,How Payers Can Address Food Insecurity among Plan Beneficiaries,"By Thomas Beaton

May 09, 2018 - Payers are constantly challenged to provide their health plan beneficiaries the best possible healthcare experiences, but may have trouble doing that if members experience food insecurity.

Food security is just one lifestyle need that plays into a member’s social determinants of health. Beneficiaries may have housing, transportation access, and additional socioeconomic challenges that make it more difficult for members to prevent or manage chronic diseases.

Poor nutrition and inadequate food access affecting an alarming number of Americans, and can lead to the development of chronic diseases that are costly to treat. Beneficiaries may also live in areas called food deserts where the only food sources are fast food or similar meal options with poor nutritional value.

How can healthcare payers address food insecurity among their beneficiaries to improve wellness and decrease costs around chronic disease care?

How prevalent is food insecurity?

The most recent information from the USDA indicates that millions of Americans experience issues with food insecurity and accessing nutritional meal options.

READ MORE: How Payer Philanthropy Can Address Social Determinants of Health

In 2016, 12.3 percent of the US population was food insecure (51 million people). In the same year, 16.6 percent of households with children were food insecure. Food insecurity rates barely changed from 2015 when 12.7 percent of the population was food insecure.

A small percentage of households with children experienced some of the most extreme cases of food insecurity. In 0.8 percent of households with children (298,000 households), one or more children experienced disruptions in food intake and eating patterns.

The USDA also found that food insecurity is more common in certain demographics. Higher than average rates of food insecurity were found in:

Households with children and a single mother (31.6 percent)

Households with children and a single father (21.7 percent)

Households with incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty level (31.6 percent)

African American households (22.5 percent)

Data gathered by Feeding America found a greater number of food insecure areas in Southern regions of the US. An interactive map reveals that food insecure individuals may sometimes earn incomes that are just high enough to keep them from earning federal food assistance (SNAP benefits).

In Mississippi, 20 percent of individuals are food insecure. In addition, 30 percent of all individuals earn incomes above 135-185 percent of the federal poverty level, making them ineligible for SNAP benefits and could overlap into food insecure populations.

READ MORE: Using Social Determinants of Health for Risk Stratification

Similar food security barriers were found in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama.

Food insecurity correlates to chronic diseases

Food insecurity has a strong relationship to the development of costly chronic diseases such as COPD, diabetes, and asthma, according to the USDA’s Economic Research Service.

The probability of developing a chronic condition in a food insecure household is 56 percent, compared to 37.4 percent in food secure households. Food insecure individuals also have double the incidence of terminal diseases such as cancer, stroke, and kidney disease when compared to individuals with higher levels of food security.

The research team determined that food insecurity is a standalone factor when determining a person’s likelihood of developing a chronic disease.

“Low or very low food security could make it that much more difficult to live with cancer or diabetes, all other things being equal,” the team said. “The effort to understand these correlations is also an effort to understand the extra challenges faced by low-income adults with any degree of food insecurity.”

READ MORE: How Payers Address Deep-Rooted Social Determinants of Health

Food insecurity may also increase behaviors that lead to poor cardiometabolic health, an indicator of a person’s risk for developing diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.

Research conducted by the CDC and nutrition professionals at the University of Delaware nutritional experts found that food insecure groups were two times more likely to skip breakfast and 60 percent more likely to experience disruptive sleep patterns.

In addition, food insecure adolescents had a 65 percent increased likelihood of tobacco use compared to food secure peers. The findings indicate that food insecurity and nutritional issues may encourage individuals to participate in activities that negatively affect their health.

How payers can address food insecurity for their beneficiaries

Payers that want to address food insecurity need to partner with local organizations that specialize in food assistance for vulnerable individuals.

Local organizations may include food banks and pantries, farm sharing groups, advocacy groups, and related entities that provide meals to at-risk people. Payers could help these organizations by allocating payments and funding for meal sharing programs.

Health Partners Plans (HPP), a Philadelphia-area payer, developed the Food-as-Medicine program to address the relationship between chronic diseases and food insecure beneficiaries.

HPP partnered with a local group called Metropolitan Area Neighborhood Nutrition Alliance (MANNA) to provide food insecure members with 21 meals a week. HPP bundled the cost of meals per member based on expected healthcare outcomes.

The outcomes of the Food-as Medicine program included a 27 percent reduction in hospital admissions, a 6.9 percent reduction in ED visits, and a 15.9 percent reduction in provider visits.

For large commercial payers with millions of beneficiaries, community partnerships could help to identify and address the needs of members without regular access to nutritional choices.

Food insecurity is a major part of Humana’s Bold Goal initiative, the payer’s long-term strategy to address community-level social determinants of health.

Humana found that food insecure older beneficiaries are 50 percent more likely to develop diabetes, 14 percent more likely to develop high blood pressure, and 60 percent more likely to experience a heart attack.

The organization implemented meal sharing programs and food bank partnerships to address food insecurity for senior members.

Food insecurity issues for a payer may also be related to an overwhelming amount of beneficiaries living in food deserts. Payers may wish to investigate partnerships with nearby farms and organic produce wholesalers to give members healthier food options.

BlueCross BlueShield of Arizona addressed food deserts in their member groups through a mobile produce program to offer beneficiaries more healthy eating options.

The Nourishing Arizona program has provided over 220,000 meal products and provides members with cookbooks and educational materials about healthy dietary needs. The service has expanded to nearly 1000 food deserts within the state of Arizona.

Managing food security issues is likely to help payers combat the development of chronic diseases, manage rising healthcare costs, and create better healthcare opportunities for their members.","How can healthcare payers address food insecurity among their beneficiaries to improve wellness and decrease costs around chronic disease care?

Organizers at the Mississippi Food Network have ordered extra food in anticipation to feed even more people than they already have this year. The group distributes food year round. They have distributed almost 13 million more pounds of food compared to last year.

Kelly Mott, director of external affairs for the Mississippi Food Network, said in a normal year, the warehouse would be full of food bins from in-person donations. Although there haven’t been as many in-person donations this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual food drives have increased.

“This year, we have been blessed beyond measure to see an increase in donations. Mississippians always seen to show up and show out, and we are so appreciative to our donors that continue to give so that we can meet the need of our hungry neighbors,” stated Mott.

The organization received a major donation from Kroger on Thursday. The grocery store chain donated more than 1,700 food boxes, which contain non-perishable food items.

Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently made donations to Alcorn State University and Tougaloo College, donated $9 million to the Mississippi Food Network. This is the single largest donation the organization has ever had. Scott is the former wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

“MacKenzie Scott’s investment in Mississippi is a vote of confidence in the work we are all doing together to end hunger in our great state,” said Mississippi Food Network CEO Charles Beady. “From our more than 400 member agencies and our food donors, to all the individuals, businesses and foundations that support us with financial contributions at every level – we should all feel proud to receive this national and international recognition.”

2,2,"Feb 26, 2020",Jackson Free Press,Jackson's Food Insecurity Focus in April Expo,"In a state where one in four children go to bed hungry at night, solutions to the food insecurity that plagues Jackson and other southern cities are the goal of a series of public art installations and workshops. The Fertile Ground Expo, scheduled for April 9-11, aims to address the history and future of food access in Mississippi and beyond.

""We know when you are hungry, you can't perform at your best,"" Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at a press conference Tuesday in downtown Jackson. ""Hunger is a problem that reaches beyond one's belly but affects every aspect of a person's way of life, which ultimately impacts how we function as a society.""

Agriculture may be the state's leading industry, but Mississippi remains one of the hungriest in the country, Salam Rida pointed out at the presser. She is a program manager for the expo and an urban designer for the City of Jackson.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as ""a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food."" In a recent report, the department revealed that more than 37 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2018.

Mississippi has consistently ranked as one of the most food-insecure states in the nation. Between 2010 and 2018, the state ranked No. 1 in food insecurity. It also has the highest poverty rate.

One in four Mississsippians—more than 600,000 people—experience food insecurity. The issue is especially profound for the state's elderly population and children. Half the state's senior population does not have enough to eat, and about 25% of Mississippi's children go to sleep hungry.

The Mississippi Food Network reports that in Hinds County alone, nearly 62,000 people have too little to eat—more than the entire food-insecure population of North Dakota.

Food insecurity has multiple adverse health impacts, ranging from developmental problems for young people to difficulties concentrating in school. Given that nutritious foods tend to be more expensive than unhealthy foods, families struggling with food access are more likely to eat foods that are detrimental to their overall physical health. Experts also link food insecurity to additional problems such as housing access and inadequate access to medical care.

The USDA notes that a number of state-level factors affect the degree to which a state experiences food insecurity. These include wages, housing costs and unemployment as well as ""State-level policies that affect access to unemployment insurance, the State Earned Income Tax Credit, and nutrition assistance programs.""

""The goal of the expo weekend is not only to be critical of our existing food system, but to provide new ideas and solutions for developing a more food-secure environment for southern cities,"" Rida said.

Scheduled to take place in various Jackson neighborhoods experiencing food-access issues, the Fertile Ground Expo will bring together prominent area and national chefs, nutritionists, farmers, activists, artists, and policy makers for workshops, dialogues and exhibits related to food. More than 30 events will tackle topics including the history of food insecurity, how to ferment food, urban farming, food waste, the food traditions of Farish Street, the impact of food insecurity on families and more.

The event is free.

Participants include acclaimed artist Kara Walker, chef and food writer Mark Bittman, local chef Nick Wallace and interdisciplinary Mississippi artist Adrienne Domnick.

The mayor thanked Bloomberg Philanthropy for its $1-million gift to organize the expo. In 2018, Jackson became one of five cities that the philanthropic organization selected from a pool of more than 200 applicants as part of its Public Art Challenge competition. At the Feb. 25 press conference, Lumumba added that Bloomberg Philanthropy work was independent of Mike Bloomberg's campaign for the presidency, while emphasizing the need to focus on the problem of hunger.

""We live in a world of abundance, but we operate from a place of scarcity. In our society, there is no room or justification for anyone to go hungry, for anyone not to have access to healthy food options,"" the mayor said at the press conference, adding that food is how Mississippians show love in their communities.

""Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people. In spaces where people often have very little to offer, food is one of the few things that they can give you and provide you to demonstrate their love and appreciation for you. As a city, we should return the love,"" he said.

3,3,"Nov 23, 2020",,"Survey: Food Insecurity, Lack of Support Remain Top Challenges for Mississippians Receiving SNAP","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic. A new state survey of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients finds that Mississippi families need help with food, housing and utilities, especially since government assistance for many families expired earlier this year.

The survey was released by the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP). It found that 66 percent of those surveyed were having trouble buying enough food at some point during the pandemic. Child care issues were cited by 32 percent and the loss of jobs were also cited by 29 percent.

“Food security was a challenge for many Mississippians well before the pandemic, whether it was people struggling to make ends meet in low wage work or who lacked access to fresh food where they lived,” said Sara Miller, policy analyst at the Hope Policy Institute. “As the pandemic brings these issues to a crisis point, families and communities need both near-term recovery efforts and improvements to food systems in our state overall.”

Government assistance has made a real difference, with 51 percent of respondents saying programs or assistance helped. But most of that aid has expired. Organizations like the SPLC Action Fund, Hope Policy Institute, Children’s Defense Fund, Hope Delta and Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Mississippi, Mississippi Center for Justice and the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative are calling for the state and federal government to take these concerns into account and move immediately to provide more assistance.

“What this survey shows is that people need help,” said Brandon Jones, Mississippi policy director for the SPLC Action Fund. “We need the government, both at the state and federal level, to do more to help the people who are suffering because of the pandemic.”

Of the 12 Southern states surveyed, Mississippi was the only state to have SNAP and P-EBT application issues as the greatest challenges. All other Southern states had problems with unemployment insurance or stimulus checks as the top challenge. The share of Mississippi respondents who had problems applying for or receiving SNAP was 10 percentage points higher than the share for all Southern respondents (23% vs. 13%).

“The pandemic has exacerbated poverty in Mississippi and the need for holistic systems of support is urgent,” said Carol Burnett of the Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative. “Mississippians need access to food, child care, housing and employment assistance to rebuild their economic security. Mississippians who received pandemic unemployment benefits were priced out of SNAP and consequently lost food assistance, a glaring example of our fractured safety net.”

The data came from 297 anonymized surveys in Mississippi in August and September. Respondents were invited to answer a mixture of multiple choice and open-ended questions about challenges and changes in the wake of the pandemic, experiences using and applying for government benefits, and recommendations and requests for policymakers.","JACKSON, Mississippi - Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in March, food insecurity and child care have been major issues during this pandemic.

4,4,"Nov 24, 2020",WJTV,Mississippi Food Network aims to address food insecurity in state,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – This holiday season many people are working to feed those in need, but hunger is an issue that for some is an everyday reality.

12 News spoke to the Mississippi Food Network about its role in fighting food insecurity statewide, which has become a problem for 56 percent of seniors and more than 600,000 people.

“Mississippi is a state that has dealt with food insecurity way before the pandemic happened,” said Crystal Alfaro.

Alfaro said she knows what it’s like to not have enough to eat. She said the pandemic has increased the need for many families.

“For not just people who were already dealing with it, but also for people that never imagined in their wildest dreams. So it’s increased the need in ways we would never have imagined, and it’s increased the work that we do.”

In October of 2019, the Mississippi Food network distributed 24 million pounds of food, but this year that number jumped to 37 million.

“We have lots of different programs. We feed citizens, and there are lots of different ways to get involved,” said Alfaro.

Pastor Devon Adams said, “We normally operate every week and sometimes twice a week on every 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturday, and the Mississippi Food Network saw what we were doing and partnered with us, and they have been a blessing to us and the City of Jackson. And I’ve ever found that people come from Clinton and Bolton to get some of this.”

The Mississippi Food Network is continuing to accept volunteers and agency partners. They encourage anyone interested in fighting food insecurity to reach out.

6,6,"Apr 6, 2020",The Guardian,"In the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, a virus hits home: 'Hunger is rampant'","On the cracked country roads of Lexington, deep in the Mississippi delta, an empty yellow school bus drives slowly, making life-sustaining drop-offs on the way.

Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection. There has been one recorded Covid-19 death in the county, Clinton Cobbins, Lexington’s first African American mayor. But even now the coronavirus still poses a serious threat to life.

In Holmes county consolidated – the school district to which Lexington belongs – every single child qualifies for free school meals, a marker of pervasive poverty. For many, said the superintendent, Dr James L Henderson, breakfast and lunch at school are the only nutritious meals a student will eat in a day. For a few, they are the only meals.

When the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.

Many children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.

“We absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,” he said. “We have to do it on behalf of our children. It’s just that simple. Families are suffering here.”

“If there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we’re providing for all children.

The novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America’s most food-insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food-insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.

As the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages – two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.

‘This is getting so much harder’

His mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.

“With the money that we do have we’ve got to try and pay the bills,” she said. “And when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.”

At the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.

Quick Guide How you can help US food banks in the Covid-19 pandemic Show How to help Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help. Donate money or supplies The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families. If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund. Volunteers Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice. Social media Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.

“This is getting so much harder,” she said. “We’re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.”

Holmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.

Zelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call-in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices – in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.

“I couldn’t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,” she said. “So I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said ‘I’m not paying’. My brain just melted because I was so upset.”

In a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington’s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.

“If people have a problem they should report it to the attorney general of Mississippi,” he said. “We’re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.”

Mississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared with other hotspots in the US – particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.

As the school bus food drop-offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.

“I pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,” Reeves said.

But the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.

“Hunger is rampant here,” said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. “Six hundred thousand were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.”

The network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state’s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.

“We have more phone calls than we can handle,” Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.

‘It’s like a scavenger hunt’

In Jackson, the state’s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods.

Like Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pickup meal service there are no drop-offs here.

April Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.

Volunteers from the Poor People’s Campaign, and Operation Good – a local collective of activists – have been organizing hot food drop-offs at this low-income apartment complex, for the past week.

“It’s like a scavenger hunt,” Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. “People are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.”

She lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.

“I just took it,” she said. “I bought a block of cheese. That was it.”","Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection.

7,7,"Dec 7, 2020",,Millions of hungry Americans turn to food banks for first time,"The deadly pandemic that tore through the nation’s heartland struck just as Aaron Crawford was in a moment of crisis. He was looking for work, his wife needed surgery, then the virus began eating away at her work hours and her paycheck.

The Crawfords had no savings, mounting bills and a growing dread: What if they ran out of food? The couple had two boys, 5 and 10, and boxes of macaroni and cheese from the dollar store could go only so far.

A 37-year-old Navy vet, Crawford saw himself as self-reliant. Asking for food made him uncomfortable. “I felt like I was a failure,” he says. “It’s this whole stigma … this mindset that you’re this guy who can’t provide for his family, that you’re a deadbeat.”

Hunger is a harsh reality in the richest country in the world. Even during times of prosperity, schools hand out millions of hot meals a day to children, and desperate elderly Americans are sometimes forced to choose between medicine and food.

Now, in the pandemic of 2020, with illness, job loss and business closures, millions more Americans are worried about empty refrigerators and barren cupboards. Food banks are doling out meals at a rapid pace and an Associated Press data analysis found a sharp rise in the amount of food distributed compared with last year. Meanwhile, some folks are skipping meals so their children can eat and others are depending on cheap food that lacks nutrition.

Those fighting hunger say they’ve never seen anything like this in America, even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

The first place many Americans are finding relief is a neighborhood food pantry, most connected to vast networks of nonprofits. Tons of food move each day from grocery store discards and government handouts to warehouse distribution centers, and then to the neighborhood charity.

WATCH: America’s hunger crisis grows more severe amid pandemic recession

The Crawfords turned to the Family Resource Centers and Food Shelf, part of 360 Communities, a nonprofit 15 minutes from their apartment in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When needed, they receive monthly boxes of fresh produce, dairy, deli, meat and other basics — enough food to fill two grocery carts. If that runs out, they can get an emergency package to tide them over for the rest of the month.

Crawford’s wife, Sheyla, had insisted they seek help; her hours had been cut at the day care center where she worked. At first, Crawford was embarrassed to go the food shelf; he worried he’d bump into someone he knew. He now sees it differently.

“It didn’t make me a bad man or a terrible husband or father,” he says. “On the contrary, I was actually doing something to make sure that my wife and kids had … food to eat.”

The history books are filled with iconic images of America’s struggles against hunger. Among the most memorable are the Depression-era photos of men standing in breadlines, huddled in long coats and fedoras, their eyes large with fear. An overhead sign reads: “Free Soup. Coffee and a Doughnut for the Unemployed.”

This year’s portrait of hunger has a distinctively bird’s eye view: Enormous traffic jams captured from drone-carrying cameras. Cars inching along, each driver waiting hours for a box or bag of food. From Anaheim, California to San Antonio, Texas to Toledo, Ohio and Orlando, Florida and points in-between, thousands of vehicles carrying hungry people queued up for miles across the horizon. In New York, and other large cities, people stand, waiting for blocks on end.

The newly hungry have similar stories: Their industry collapsed, they lost a job, their hours were cut, an opportunity fell through because of illness.

Handwritten “closed” signs appeared on the windows of stores and restaurants soon after the pandemic arrived. Paychecks shrank or disappeared altogether as unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7 percent, a rate not seen in almost a century.

Food banks felt the pressure almost immediately.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, scrambled to keep up as states locked down and schools — many providing free breakfasts and lunches — closed. In late March, 20 percent of the organization’s 200 food banks were in danger of running out of food.

The problem with supply subsided, but demand has not. Feeding America has never handed out so much food so fast — 4.2 billion meals from March through October. The organization has seen a 60 percent average increase in food bank users during the pandemic: about 4 in 10 are first-timers.

An AP analysis of Feeding America data from 181 food banks in its network found the organization has distributed nearly 57 percent more food in the third quarter of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

There will be no quick decline as the pandemic rages on, having already claimed more than 280,000 lives and infecting 14.7 million people across the nation.

Feeding America estimates those facing hunger will swell to 1 in 6 people, from 35 million in 2019 to more than 50 million by this year’s end. The consequences are even more dire for children — 1 in 4, according to the group.

Some states have been hit especially hard: Nevada, a tourist mecca whose hotel, casino and restaurant industries were battered by the pandemic, is projected to vault from 20th place in 2018 to 5th place this year in food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America.

In four states — Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana — more than 1 in 5 residents are expected to be food insecure by year’s end, meaning they won’t have money or resources to put food on the table, the report said.

In New Orleans one recent Saturday morning, Donna Duerr was waiting to pick up food in a drive-through donation — something that has become part of her routine since COVID-19 swept in last spring.

Her husband was laid off from his job as a pipefitter and she’s unable to work, having undergone two surgeries — one on her spine, the other on her arm — in the last two months. She also has two grown children who’ve moved home since the pandemic began.

“This is a hard thing to accept that you have to do this,” says a weary-sounding Duerr, her throat covered with bandages as the result of a recent operation. Every morning she monitors the local news for announcements of the next food donation; she tries to attend as many as she can, sometimes sharing the food with less-mobile neighbors.

Duerr, 56, faces painful choices. “I either pay bills or get food,” she says, though these donations have brought some relief.

Norman Butler is another first-timer. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he and his girlfriend, Cheryl, arrived at 3 a.m. at a drive-through food bank in a suburban New Orleans sports stadium. They joined a pre-dawn procession of mothers with their kids, the elderly and folks like him — unemployed workers.

“You can see the look of uncertainty on their faces,” he says. “Everybody’s just worried about their next meal.”

Before the pandemic, Butler, 53, flourished in the tourism-dominated city, working as an airport shuttle and limousine driver, a valet and hotel doorman. Since March, when the bustling streets turned silent, jobs in the city have been scarce.

“A lot of people are in limbo,” he says. “The main thing we need is to get back to work.”

High cost-of-living

Low-wage employees, many in the service industry, have borne the brunt of economic hardship. But the misery has reached deeper into the workforce.

A September report commissioned by the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, found 1 in 4 of those reporting they didn’t have enough to eat typically had incomes above $50,000 a year before the outbreak.

In Anchorage, Alaska, Brian and Airis Messick were coasting along in full-time jobs for companies that support the state’s oil industry. They were moving toward buying a house.

When March arrived, everything unraveled.

Brian, 28, the newest hire at an electrical wiring company, was laid off. Within a week, Airis, an office worker at an oil well testing firm, lost her job, too.

Then it became a monthly game of deciding who gets paid first with their unemployment checks — the landlord or one of the many bills. They kept their car filled with gas in case they had to move.

The Messicks and their 9-year-old son, Jayden, tried to survive on $50 to $75 a week because, she says, “that’s all we could squeeze.” They turned to a food bank for only the second time — they’d sought help after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.

After that devastation, the Messicks, who’d met in Florida, decided to get a fresh start and move to Alaska, where Airis had grown up.

Airis, who just turned 30, found work in August, ironically, at the state unemployment office. “I hear people’s stories all day,” she says. “I listen to moms cry about not having money to take care of their kids. My heart aches for the people who get denied.”

Brian stays home with Jayden, who is autistic, helping him with school and driving him to appointments. Also part of the family are Cleo, a pit bull-lab mix, and Daisy, a bearded dragon.

Airis earns too much for the family to receive state financial aid. Anchorage’s high cost-of-living, partly fueled by the expense of shipping goods to the nation’s most northern state, makes it harder to economize even with coupons and careful shopping.

She says the family will continue to go to the food bank until the economy improves, which she expects won’t be soon.

There should be better systems in place, she says, to help families.

“I feel great knowing that we’re not alone, that we’re, you know, not out here being the only one suffering but,” she says, “it makes me mad to know my government failed us.”

Communities of color

For communities of color, the pandemic has been a compound disaster with Blacks and Latinos reeling from disproportionately high rates of deaths, infections — and joblessness.

Unemployment surged among Latinos to 18.9 percent this spring, higher than any other racial and ethnic group, according to federal statistics. Though it has since fallen, many are still struggling.

More than 1 in 5 Black and Latino adults with children said as of July 2020 they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat, according to the commissioned report. That was double the rate of white and Asian households. It also found that women, households with children and people of color are at greatest risk of hunger.

Abigail Leocadio, 34, first approached the nonprofit Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, Arizona, during hard times about a decade ago. Her family rebounded and she completed training to become a phlebotomist, landing a job drawing blood specimens for a local lab.

Leocadio was just 7 when her family brought her to the U.S. from their native Cuernavaca, Mexico. She currently is protected from deportation and has a work permit through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

When her husband, a restaurant cook, was laid off earlier in the pandemic, her income — barely more than the $11 state minimum wage — wasn’t enough to cover their expenses.

Though they own a two-bedroom trailer, they pay $500 a month to rent the lot. Add to that as much as $450 in monthly electric bills and internet service so their four kids, 9 to 15, can attend class remotely. Before schools closed, the kids received free breakfasts and lunches on campus.

WATCH: How economic factors are putting people of color at greater risk for coronavirus

“It has been hard feeding all the kiddos daily,” Leocadio said outside the trailer after a recent delivery from the charity of two boxes including canned tomatoes, dried beans, rice, breakfast cereal and the kids’ undisputed favorite: specialty Oreo cookies.

The food, she says, provides less than half of what her family eats in four weeks, but significantly reduces their monthly bill to about $250. Before the pandemic, the family was saving to buy a house, but that money has been wiped out. Her husband, though, is back at work.

“We always figure out things one way or another,” Leocadio says, though she’s worried about the surge in coronavirus cases and what lies ahead. “We really don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Briana Dominguez had been depending on food pantries in the Chicago area since last fall to supplement her groceries. With two sons, ages 3 and 14, it was hard to keep up, even though she and her boyfriend both worked full-time.

“I never thought it would be me,” she says of her visits to the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois. “But you do what you gotta do to survive.”

A series of misfortunes brought them to a turning point.

Dominguez had a miscarriage, and her father lost his job, due to the pandemic. So did her boyfriend, a trucker. In November her company, which sells ceiling tiles for hospitals and other business, eliminated her job with little notice.

Dominguez, 34, who has a small severance, has decided to move to Georgia, where she has family and living costs are lower. Her boyfriend has found work as a customer service representative that he can do from anywhere, though it’s only $13 an hour. She traveled there in early December to scout job possibilities.

“If I don’t do it now,” she says, “I’ll never do it.”

Government assistance

While food banks have become critical during the pandemic, they’re just one path for combating hunger. For every meal from a food bank, a federal program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, provides nine.

Anti-hunger groups have lobbied Congress for a 15 percent increase in maximum food stamp benefits, A similar measure went a long way in digging the nation out of the Great Recession. A stimulus bill passed by the House this spring includes such a provision, but it has been bogged down in partisan squabbling.

“Food banks and food pantries are doing great work,” says Luis Guardia, president of thee Food Research & Action Center. “But they simply cannot do enough to be something of the order of magnitude that we’re seeing right now.”

Many going to food pantries also are receiving food stamps, though eligibility varies among states.

Aaron Crawford says the addition of $550 in food stamps the family started receiving last summer has made a significant difference in their lives.

Others have discovered they couldn’t make it without food help, even with Social Security or other benefits.

Phyllis Marder, 66, had both Social Security and unemployment when she arrived at the Hillside Food Pantry in Evanston, Illinois, where she’s lived in the same bungalow for 20 years.

She’d been supplementing her benefits as an Uber drive, and when the pandemic hit, she helped workers bring home their computers and office gear. After that, she ferried medical and other front-line workers, but that came to an abrupt end with a COVID-19 scare.

At first, Marder, didn’t tell anyone about visiting food pantries. Then she had a change of heart. “Keeping a secret makes things get worse,” she says, “… and makes me feel worse about myself, and so I decided that it was more important to talk about it.”

Marder sometimes shared her food with neighbors and a panhandler on a freeway ramp. But she expects her food bank visits will end soon.

In a few days, she starts a job — courtesy of the pandemic.

She’ll be a coronavirus contract tracer, working remotely for a nearby county.

Moments of relief

As the year nears its end, Crawford is more confident.

The months have been filled with setbacks and successes. Both Crawfords developed mild cases of COVID-19. Sheyla had hysterectomy surgery and was out work without pay for six weeks.

But they’ve rebounded, too.

Crawford has two part-time jobs, one at United Parcel Service, the second as a maintenance worker at a home for the elderly. His wife is back at work at the day care center. And their boys are receiving breakfast and lunch at their school that provides day care.

The financial troubles that brought them to the food bank haven’t disappeared. They still have overdue bills and a car that needs repairs.

But after many dark months, there have been moments of relief. This fall when the couple contracted COVID-19, their sons’ school sent meals and milk to help.

And a friend had an 18-pound turkey delivered for a Thanksgiving feast. It was so big the Crawfords had to figure out how to find room for the leftovers in the refrigerator now stocked with food.

Distributing boxes of food to those in need is a familiar scene during the holidays. But it's a year-round mission for food banks, other nonprofits and volunteers.

Food insecurity has long been an issue in Mississippi.

According to Feeding America's latest Map the Meal Gap snapshot, in 2018 nearly 560,000 people in the state — including 162,000 children — were considered food insecure, meaning they couldn't put enough food on the table for everyone in the household to live a healthy life. Although Texas boasted the highest number of people considered insecure in its state, Mississippi had the highest percentage.

The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. According to Feeding America's research, more than 22% of Mississippi's population is expected to be food insecure due to the virus, the highest rate in the nation.

With more than 8.2% unemployed in Forrest County and 5.9% in Lamar County, nonprofits are seeing an increased demand for assistance.

'They come to us not wanting to ask for food, but they have to'

The Salvation Army in Hattiesburg said it had served 33% more individuals to date this year than in 2019.

The Petal Children's Task Force, a nonprofit in Petal, on Friday gave away 325 boxes of Thanksgiving food to residents living in Petal School District, about 75 more boxes than last year, according to Demaris Lee, Petal Children's Task Force executive director.

""We've been very fortunate that the churches help us out in this area and we purchase food that everyone will get a turkey for Thanksgiving,"" Lee said. ""They'll get a box of food. They'll get bread and extras.""

Lee said the Petal Children's Task Force has seen an increase in need, serving more than 468 families per month in 2020 compared with 360 families in 2019.

""We've got a lot of people who have been cut in hours, some that have lost their jobs, and they come to us not wanting to ask for food, but they have to,"" Lee said. ""That's what we are here for.""

As the need has increased in Petal, so has the need for donations, Lee said.

""We need food,"" she said. ""We can use all kinds of food. We have a cooler. We have a freezer.""

Farmers to Families boxes were 'manna from heaven'

Ann McCullen, executive director of Edwards Street Fellowship Center in Hattiesburg, was contacted in April by the Mississippi Food Network to assist with the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. The statewide network incudes more than 88 organizations and churches in 11 counties in the Pine Belt.

""(The program) was manna from heaven, but that's not the norm, and COVID-19 is not the norm,"" McCullen said.

The program, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture initiated in April amid the pandemic to distribute food to faith-based organizations nationwide, has since ended.

""At that time, they were talking about 1,000 boxes a week to distribute, and between the three largest food network services here — Christian Services, Petal Children's Task Force and Edwards Street Fellowship Center — that wasn't going to supply any of us for a week,"" McCullen said. ""At the time I told them we were seeing about 1,700 families a week.""

For 18 weeks, Edwards Street Fellowship Center coordinated the Farmers to Food Box program with Christian Services.

McCann Memorial Temple in Hattiesburg also participated. Clarissa Creagh, administrator at McCann Memorial Temple, said the church distributed food boxes weekly on Thursdays.

""We had more than 300 people come, and every week I would get a different amount of boxes,"" Creagh said. ""I never got a set amount, but each time I averaged between 200-300 cars.""

McCullen said if anyone has a need for food, they should reach out to local food bank.

9,9,"May 4, 2018",Mississippi Today,Mississippi still the hungriest state,"For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

“We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.

10,10,"Dec 6, 2019",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Child hunger in Mississippi is real. Let's solve the food insecurity problem.,"Between the great American feast days of Thanksgiving and Christmas seems like the right time to write about child hunger. Our state has a persistent problem with hunger and food insecurity, with over half a million Mississippians regularly struggling to get enough to eat.

Hunger is especially hard on children and Mississippi still has the highest rate of food-insecure children in the US, according to Feeding America. Some regularly miss meals. About half of Mississippi households receiving SNAP federal food assistance include children.

We know that our persistent poverty is largely to blame; 50 of Mississippi’s food-insecure counties have had poverty rates of 20 percent or more for over 30 years. However, policy decisions on both the federal and state levels also affect who gets enough to eat.

A lack of accessible grocery stores plagues large parts of our state. Attempts by Senator David Blount and Rep. Jarvis Dortch in the state Legislature to get bills passed providing tax incentives for opening grocery stores in Food Deserts are regularly killed by lobbyists for the fast-food industry since people eat less fast food if there is a good grocery store nearby.

The current administration in Washington has been looking for ways to cut federal food assistance expenditures, including school lunches and SNAP. Under rules introduced under the Obama administration, all students in a public school or even all the students in a public school district can get free lunches if the percentage of low-income children qualifying for free lunch there is 40 percent or more. The 40 percent can include children on SNAP, children in foster care, and children who are homeless.

Feeding breakfast and lunch to all the children in a public school for free cuts down on paperwork and administrative costs, and makes it easier for school kitchens to provide more appetizing and nutritious meals. And it eliminates student lunch debt. According to the USDA, about 13.7 million schoolchildren attend public schools where everyone eats free. Something good to eat makes it easier for children to concentrate on learning. However, newly proposed rules by the Trump administration would make it harder to qualify for this federal funding and add paperwork.

Several Democratic candidates for president are calling for the expansion of the free school lunch program to all public school students, something that would cost about $19.6 billion a year. Cory Booker, Julian Castro, and Bernie Sanders have all proposed some version of free lunch programs for all public school students. Castro’s plan would also provide low-income students with three meals a day during summer months.

Castro further proposes federal grants to help open grocery stores in food deserts. As many small towns in this state have learned, a grocery store can be a linchpin that not only improves people’s access to fresh and nutritious food and provides good jobs, but also helps other small businesses prosper.

Although food deserts are most often found in rural areas, there are parts of Hinds County, including in Jackson, that qualify as food deserts because there are no nearby grocery stores. Add that to the fact that a full fourth of the people in Hinds County are food insecure. People in food deserts, by definition high poverty areas, can pay up to 37 percent more for the exact same produce as everybody else.

Surely we all agree that it is not good for children to go hungry. It’s not good for children’s brains or general health, or their overall sense of well-being. Children who grow up food insecure are more likely to develop diabetes, high blood pressure, have strokes, have complications during pregnancy, and get cancer.

It is not a hard fix. All it takes is the will to do it.

11,11,"May 20, 2020",PRNewswire,Feeding America Study Projects Local Food Insecurity Rates Amid Pandemic Could Reach Up To 1 In 3 Adults And 1 In 2 Children,"CHICAGO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will have a devastating impact on people facing hunger across communities nationwide, according to a new study by Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization. This study is the first of its kind to explore how food insecurity rates at the local level may increase in 2020 due to COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity analyzes food insecurity rates for the overall population and children by state, county and congressional district. According to the study, communities that had higher rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will continue to struggle more than other areas. Meanwhile, communities with lower rates of food insecurity pre-COVID-19 will tend to see the largest relative increases in food insecurity as a result of the crisis.

Pre-pandemic – and according to the USDA's most recent report on food security in the U.S. – 37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life. However, a recent Feeding America analysis demonstrates that this number is likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children. That means approximately 54 million people (1 in 6 people) may experience food insecurity in 2020, including 18 million children (1 in 4 children).

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

According to The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, the states projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity among the overall population include Mississippi (24.1 percent), Arkansas (22.5 percent), Alabama (22.2 percent), Louisiana (21.7 percent) and New Mexico (20.7 percent). Meanwhile, the states projected to have the highest rates of child food insecurity include Louisiana (34.5 percent), New Mexico (33.9 percent), Nevada (32.9 percent), Mississippi (32.6 percent) and Alabama (32.4 percent). One in three children in these states will likely experience food insecurity this year.

Specific counties projected to have the highest rates of food insecurity this year are:

Jefferson County, MS (34.2 percent for overall population)

(34.2 percent for overall population) Issaquena County, MS (33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children)

(33.9 percent for overall population, 49.9 percent for children) East Carrol Parish , LA (33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children)

(33.2 percent for overall population, 52.5 percent for children) Kusilvak Census Area, AK (33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children)

(33.1 percent for overall population, 52.3 percent for children) Holmes County, MS (32.7 percent for overall population)

(32.7 percent for overall population) Sabine County, TX (49.1 percent for children)

(49.1 percent for children) Zavala County, TX (48.9 percent for children)

Additionally, the counties that may see the highest change in food insecurity rates for the overall population are:

Burke County, ND (157 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(157 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Renville County, ND (131 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(131 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Dickey County, ND (127 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(127 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Loudoun County, VA (125 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

(125 percent change from 2018 to 2020) Eagle County, CO (124 percent change from 2018 to 2020)

""More of our neighbors in these communities and beyond are relying in part on charitable food assistance to make ends meet,"" said Babineaux-Fontenot. ""As a result, food banks are facing a 'perfect storm' of surges in demand, declining food donations, fewer volunteers and disruptions to our operating procedures. Regardless of these challenges, we will continue to stay strong and resilient and work our best to help ensure our neighbors have food on the table.""

This new analysis was conducted by building upon the approach Feeding America used in two earlier briefs to predict changes to national food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to changes to poverty and unemployment. The annual projected unemployment rate (11.5%) is within close range of expert estimates when annualized, including those from a monthly Wall Street Journal survey of more than 60 economists as of May (11.6%), the Congressional Budget Office (11.4%), and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (10.3%). To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national unemployment projection for job loss due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

The underlying analysis for the food insecurity projections was conducted by Dr. Craig Gundersen using the model developed for Map the Meal Gap, Feeding America's county-level food insecurity report.

Other key findings from this report regarding the overall population include:

The projected rate of food insecurity is highest for Mississippi (24.1 percent), which also had the highest rate of food insecurity in 2018.

In addition to North Dakota , states that are projected to have the highest change in food insecurity rates – from 2018 to 2020 – include Minnesota (60 percent change), Nevada (57 percent change), Wisconsin (57 percent change) and Hawaii (57 percent change).

Other key findings from this report regarding child food insecurity:

California will see the highest increase in the number of children living in food-insecure households (852,730) bringing the total to 2.2 million. Still, Texas will be home to the most children facing food insecurity (2.3 million).

12,12,1 week ago,Direct Relief,"In Mississippi, Working to Treat Food Insecurity","At one of the oldest community health centers in the country – that’s Delta Health Center in Mississippi – there’s a story about a famous doctor who used to write prescriptions for food.

Dr. Jack Geiger, the founding father of the community health center movement, would send his patients to the grocery store to get healthy food. The grocer would fill the order and send the bill to the health center.

Someone told Geiger that food couldn’t be prescribed. Geiger retorted that the best cure he knew for malnutrition was food.

Robin Boyles, who’s now the chief program planning and development officer at Delta, said that treating food insecurity “really does go back to our very, very early days…You can treat someone for an illness or infection, but if you’re sending them home and they don’t have food to eat and they don’t have clean drinking water and they don’t have sanitation, they’re not going to get well.”

Food insecurity is on the rise across the United States. In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average. A 2019 study from the USDA’s Economic Research Service found that the state had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country – 15.7% of the population experienced it.

And the state’s community health centers are coming together to do something about it – together with the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi and Direct Relief. Direct Relief provided the health center association with a $250,000 grant designed to fight hunger among Mississippi’s most vulnerable.

The result is the Cornbread Cooking Series, a program that’s designed to both increase access to food and teach people how to buy and prepare food that’s healthy and good to eat. Six Mississippi health centers will introduce or build on existing programs around food access and education.

“It’s Southern and everybody loves cornbread…it’s winter and it’s comfort,” said Janice Sherman, the association’s CEO.

But despite the homey name, Sherman is focused on new cooking techniques as well as food access. “I thought it would be an opportunity to really introduce some new areas of spices and things that will really be better for our diets,” she said.

Patients are screened for food insecurity. If they qualify, they’re referred to the program, which provides a combination of education, activities, and food vouchers or other access to healthy, nutritious food.

Sherman explained that health centers, as trusted community resources, are in an especially good position to deliver help and education. “For a provider who’s your doctor to address the fact that you need food is pretty powerful,” she said.

Three health centers participating in the program sat down with Direct Relief to talk about hunger, healthy cooking, and how they’ll use the funding.

For Patients with HIV, Closing the Cracks

At G.A. Carmichael Family Health Center, dietician Kyskie Bolton explained that there are a number of patients who are “dramatically food insecure, but don’t fall into any category where they would get significant assistance.”

In participating in the Cornbread Cooking Series, G.A. Carmichael wanted to focus on the patients who most needed intervention – in this case, by focusing on patients dealing with both food insecurity and HIV/AIDS.

Some of those patients have comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes as well.

Bolton explained that HIV-positive patients often don’t want anyone to know their diagnosis. “They will protect it at all costs, even at the cost of their hunger or nutritional health,” she said. “These are the type of patients who are going to fall through the cracks.”

G.A. Carmichael is preparing videos of healthy cooking techniques – how to prepare vegetables, for example – and a supermarket tour, to show patients who qualify for the program how to shop around the edges of the grocery store for the healthiest food.

The goal, Bolton said, is “increasing their literacy and empowering them to make better decisions so they can utilize what they have.”

The health center is also working with nearby farmers to acquire and distribute produce to patients with chronic diseases – a long-term enterprise that the funding will help them continue. Active participants in the program will also receive vouchers and gift cards to nearby grocery stores.

For Bolton, part of the challenge is reaching a diverse patient population – one that’s both rural and relatively urban, and that includes a range of ethnicities and backgrounds – and produce materials and messaging that will appeal to everyone.

However, the population does have one thing in common: “Most people here are extremely technologically advanced and don’t have much to do with cornbread,” Bolton said.

Reducing Childhood Obesity

For Dr. Wendy Williams, a pediatrician at Coastal Family Health Center, an interest in increasing food access came about when she noticed a correlation between food insecurity and obesity in the children in her practice.

“Until we started asking the questions, I had no idea how pervasive [food insecurity] is down here,” she said. “You can’t get to the bottom of pediatric obesity until you conquer that, or at least make some dents.”

The health center started by planting a vegetable garden to teach kids about healthy food. It met an enthusiastic reception: Williams said that one child described a radish as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen before putting it in his pocket to preserve it. Another was anxious to learn to grow food – his uncle, he told Williams, didn’t have enough to eat.

The Cornbread Cooking Series grant will help Coastal Family Health Center expand its program, reaching out to local farmers to acquire excess produce for patients, and launching a cooking education series.

“Down in the South we like to do things with a lot of fat and salt, so really being cognizant of that and teaching them to use other things to make food taste good,” such as herbs, will be a priority, Williams said. “It’s definitely a mindset. You have to change how people view it.”

The health center also plans to develop food boxes, working with a local food bank to get protein sources for patients and with a produce distributor to get fruits and vegetables.

But throughout it all, the community garden remains a fixture.

“You don’t even think you’re making that big a difference in the community,” Williams said. But feedback from patients – and enthusiasm for what the garden produces – have changed her mind.

“We’re teaching kids that, from the very beginning, they can be self-reliant,” she said.

Going back to the beginning

Between the pandemic and the winter storms that blanketed large swathes of the U.S. in February, need is especially high among Delta Health Center’s patients, said Neuaviska Stidhum, the health center’s chief operating officer and chief nursing officer.

“Right now, we’re in crisis,” she said. “We really want to be able to just get the hunger out, to provide for them so they won’t have that hunger.”

Since the 1960s, Delta Health Center has played a role in alleviating hunger among its patients. The health center currently has six acres of land – cultivated by a local university – that it uses to provide a range of fresh produce, from greens and sweet potatoes to fresh fruits.

Stidhum explained that, while many of their patients qualify for public assistance, it’s often not enough, or too far away to be accessible for people who don’t have transportation.

“It’s really difficult for some of our more rural patients…especially if they don’t have transportation and have to depend on someone else,” Boyles said.

The grant will be used to provide much-needed food vouchers to patients, and health providers will give patients supplemental information about how to choose and eat healthy food that won’t break the bank.

Stidhum has hopes for a kitchen in the health center someday. For the time being, providers will refer patients to cooking videos, health services, and other resources.

“We’re just going back to the beginning, to help the people any way we can,” she said.","In Mississippi in particular, food insecurity rates are higher than the national average.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted levels of food insecurity throughout the country, as millions of Americans continue to face income loss and joblessness. In June, a Northwestern University study found that food insecurity during the pandemic had doubled nationally, and tripled for households with children.

This time last year, roughly 35 million people struggled with hunger in the U.S., a number that has increased by nearly 20 million as the pandemic continues to unfold, according to Feeding America.

In a November survey conducted by the hunger relief organization, 80 percent of the 200 nationwide food banks associated with Feeding America have reported an increase in food production this year.

In total, food banks have consistently seen a 60 percent increase in demand compared to November 2019, and continue to require more food and resources to provide to people in need.

In some states, the issue reflects Depression-era levels.

In Texas, one of the hardest-hit states for COVID-19, 1 in 3 Houston households have had a serious issue affording food, and 1 in 5 do not get enough to eat every day, according to NPR.

The CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank told CNBC that his program now feeds 120,000 —or double the number of people—that they normally do. The numbers have gotten so high that they now have to ration food.

In Rhode Island, the Community Food Bank reported that one in four households struggle to put food on the table, the highest it's been since the Great Depression.

In an October report published by the University of Illinois and Feeding America, the states facing the highest levels of food insecurity include Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. In Jefferson County, Mississippi, the food insecurity rate is the highest in the country at 30.4 percent.

The issue has disproportionately effected Black, Native and Hispanic communities. According to a report from National Geographic, of the top 25 counties with the highest projected food insecurity rates, only four have a population where the majority is white.

""This is a story about racial and ethnic disparities—both food insecurity and the story of coronavirus,"" Emily Engelhard, managing director of Feeding America's research unit told National Geographic. ""The populations and geographies that started in the most disadvantageous state of food insecurity are the ones that are getting hit the hardest.""

In April, the unemployment rate during COVID-19 hit its peak at 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression, when it exceeded 25 percent.

As coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country and 2020 comes to a close, Americans are pushing for Congress to pass a second round of stimulus relief to help those struggling from income loss, hunger and joblessness.

""Unless policymakers act quickly to respond to the crisis at the scale necessary, we risk the damage to the economy lasting much longer than necessary, particularly for those at the bottom who have been hit the hardest,"" a group of more than 125 economists wrote in their open letter published by the Economic Security Project on Monday.

15,15,5 days ago,GazetteNET,Food & Farm: A ‘HIP’ way to bolster food security,"A few weeks ago, I went with my friend, Kathleen Chapman — or KC, as she’s called — to the February Winter Farmers’ Market at the Northampton Senior Center.

KC is a Southerner, a smart, funny artist and teacher who moved to Northampton from Mississippi in 2019. Shopping with her is always a good reminder of how blessed western Massachusetts is with relative abundance. Mississippi is a state that consistently ranks as the most food insecure in the nation, with a good many of its residents living miles from the nearest grocery store.

KC always remarks on the plenty of the Pioneer Valley, joking sometimes that someone needs to set up a swap between this area and the South, in which the South will ship dogs to Northampton in exchange for food.

The catch, however, is that food, along with everything else, is so much more expensive here than in Mississippi. KC, who lives in senior housing downtown, uses a combination of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — what people used to know as food stamps) and Survival Center groceries to help her stretch her fixed budget. At the Farmers’ Market, she also has access to an additional tool in the form of HIP benefits.

HIP is the Healthy Incentives Program, a state- and USDA-funded program that provides monthly incentives to SNAP households when they purchase fresh local vegetables and fruit at farmers markets, mobile markets, farm shares and farm stands. HIP automatically adds back any SNAP money spent at one of the above outlets, up to a certain amount. So, for instance, the SNAP money KC spends on local produce at the Winter Market is immediately added back to her Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, and, as a household of one, she can spend up to $40 a month on local produce via HIP.

It’s not hard to see how this might benefit the health and well-being of households with limited means. Nutrition research can be fickle and biased, but to my knowledge, there is no study that argues that increasing your daily intake of vegetables will do anything but improve your health outcomes.

And people have been using HIP. Since the program began in 2017, SNAP sales at farm retail outlets increased by a whopping 1,250%; to date, 88,000 families have used their HIP incentives, 45% of whom include seniors, and 30% of whom include children.

The program has been popular enough that the state has periodically had to halt its disbursement of HIP funding because it underestimated the demand for fresh, local produce among its low-income citizens. And besides produce, HIP can also be used to purchase edible plants, so that people who have a bit of growing room can spend their HIP allowance on veggie and herb plant starts, thus increasing their access to fresh produce for an entire season.

If these were the only benefits that accrued to the community via HIP, the program would already be an asset, but its value extends beyond the customers. HIP does a good amount of legwork in the effort to create a more sustainable food system by supporting local farmers as well.

For growers, the cost of organically raising, picking, washing, packaging and distributing produce while stewarding land in a holistic, sustainable way while paying themselves and their workers a living wage is undeniably high.

According to Olivia Pettingill of Wingate Farm, the HIP program has permitted farmers like her to cover their costs while feeding a more economically diverse range of people.

“HIP has significantly enabled a more equal distribution of high-quality produce to our local community,” she says, “and it’s done this while allowing small farmers to stay in business and even thrive.”

She points out that HIP has more lasting effects as well on the kind of general thinking and public curiosity that lead to greater food security. Local farmers try to grow produce and fruits that do well in our local climate, but that doesn’t always mean growing the vegetables that are the most conventionally recognized.

HIP incentivizes people to try different kinds of veggies that are more locally sustainable, and in doing so, it builds a marketplace that relies less on foods from far-flung places, thus reducing the carbon footprint of shipping.

SNAP Match

The program is not without its issues. As mentioned, there have been periods when it shut down for lack of funding, which is confusing and frustrating for those attempting to use their benefits. This inconsistency also limits farmers’ ability to plan, as well as HIP’s ability to make a sustained difference in people’s eating habits.

Also, if you don’t have any SNAP money left on your EBT card, you can’t access your HIP benefits, even though the two amounts are not dependent on each other. And a further issue is that the benefits are pretty specific: You can buy local vegetables and fruit, but other farm products such as eggs or meat aren’t covered.

In an effort to fill that gap, Grow Food Northampton, which operates the Tuesday Farmers’ Market and the current Winter Farmers’ Market, offers SNAP Match, a system in which Grow Food matches the amount of SNAP money an individual spends at the farmers market. (SNAP Match also doubles the match for the first $10 people spend.) In this way, farmers who sell products other than veggies aren’t left out, and people doing their shopping with SNAP benefits are given a wider selection of choices.

It’s rare, I think, to find elegant solutions where food access is concerned, and even rarer when food access, environmental stewardship and the local economy work together in any kind of synergistic fashion, which is why the combination of HIP and SNAP Match — and their potential to help further a smaller, more sustainable, and more equitable food system — is so ingenious.

The majority of SNAP Match is even funded locally, by Valley Home Improvement, which, over the last four years, has doubled the amount of assistance that Grow Food can provide to customers. Steve Silverman, Valley Home Improvement’s founder, says the company is keen on supporting local business and addressing food insecurity as well — values that are complementary and aligned in SNAP Match.

While SNAP Match will continue as long as Grow Food has the money to support it, the proposed state budget for the next fiscal year cuts HIP funding from this year’s $13 million to $5 million in 2022. Given the many benefits to both local farms and families who would otherwise lack access to sustainable fresh local produce, this seems short-sighted from every angle.

Why not keep the momentum going on a program that has demonstrated great potential to positively affect the health of the commonwealth’s most disadvantaged citizens while also allowing local farm businesses to thrive and grow food in a way increases our food security and decreases our carbon footprint?

After the events of the past year, with scary disruptions to the national supply chain due to COVID, it’s in everyone’s interest to take a closer look at the steps we can take to ensure that the bounty that KC remarked upon isn’t jeopardized — and the continued funding of HIP is one of them.

KC, by the way, came away from the Winter Market with beets and onions, eggs, a small amount of bacon for cooking with some dried lima beans, and a jug of maple syrup, which she uses to sweeten her coffee — a nice balance of items good for both body and spirit.

While on occasion the complexity of figuring out the various different systems available to help her access better quality food has been frustrating, she believes absolutely in SNAP Match and HIP as valuable resources that should be funded, and not just for her own sake.

“The vegetables are so expensive at the store that I’m hesitant to buy them,” she told me, “but here [at the Farmer’s Market], I can get these delicious fresh organic vegetables, and it’s helped me a lot. And the fact that the farmers are being supported is the biggest thrill to me.”

16,16,"Mar 20, 2019",Hattiesburg American,"Hungry for more than an education: College students use food pantries, trying to survive.","CLOSE Social work student Tyesha Christopher talks about reasons why USM students might use the Eagle's Nest food pantry

They don't have enough money to keep up with college expenses and food. They don't have the luxury of ordering pizza or worrying about the freshman 15.

These are college students in Mississippi struggling with food insecurity — where their next meal is coming from. Simple staples like bread and peanut butter, say those who have helped launch campus food pantries, can make the difference between a passing for failing grade — or staying in school and dropping out.

Now, a newly formed statewide group — the College and University Anti-Hunger Alliance — is hoping to get organizations, individuals and community groups to band together to address hunger and food insecurity at colleges and universities.

Its first meeting is being held Friday in Flowood for members of colleges and universities who have opened a food pantry or are contemplating opening one.

How bad is hunger on Mississippi college campuses?

Langston Moore, the Alliance's communication and community engagement director, estimates about half of the state's college students struggle with food insecurity. He bases that on statistics he sees in the state's K-12 population.

""Just in the Jackson Public Schools alone, 100 percent of students qualify for free and reduced lunch,"" he said. ""When they go away to college, those needs don't stop.

""There's no mechanism to replace free and reduced lunch. The students can't afford the (campus) meal ticket.""

Moore's estimate means the problem of campus hunger is worse in Mississippi than around the nation. While there are no studies that look only at Mississippi, one of the most recent national surveys — from the Wisconsin Hope Lab — found 36 percent of university students had limited or uncertain availability of food in the past 30 days, while 42 percent of community college students experienced food insecurity.

Grace Rutledge, a social work intern who works at the Eagle's Nest, the University of Southern Mississippi's food pantry, says about 30-40 students use the food pantry each of the two days a week it's open.

""I know when I first started school, sometimes I didn't plan well when it came to my budget,"" she said. ""I had the luxury of going home and saying, 'Dad, can I have some food?'

""But some people don't have that luxury. They shouldn't be going to college wondering if they can eat that month, but thinking, 'Can I study for this test or can I get an education?'""

What else do we know about campus hunger?

The Hope Lab found:

46 percent of students at four-year institutions can't afford to eat balanced meals.

44 percent worry their food will run out before they get money to buy more.

14 percent have lost weight because there wasn't enough money for food.

Tamara Hurst, Alliance faculty chair (Photo: Special to American)

Tamara Hurst, University of Southern Mississippi school of social work assistant professor and Alliance faculty chair, also estimates those numbers are worse in Mississippi.

""From student and faculty feedback, we are discovering food insecurity is more prevalent than we thought,"" she said. ""It can be (a student's) finances are such that anything can throw them over the edge (and they can't afford food).""

Rutledge sees students and faculty coming into the Eagle's Nest at the end of the month when their paychecks have run out. The most popular items they pick up are bread, shelf-stable milk, peanut butter and spices.

Why is the issue of campus hunger important?

Research shows hunger among college students is often tied to poor academic performance. The Hope Lab found 40 percent of students who were getting Fs reported food insecurity, while 33 percent of those reporting Ds said they were having trouble getting food.

""For anyone who has tried to concentrate on something when they're hungry, it's so difficult,"" Hurst said. ""We want (students) to stay in school and graduate.""

Story continues after photo gallery.

What is the Anti-Hunger Alliance?

It's a group formed under the umbrella of the Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi in Flowood that currently has members that include Hattiesburg's Extra Table, Southern Miss, Jackson State University, Jackson's Sow, Reap, Feed, the Mississippi Center for Justice and the American Heart Association.

One of its first missions will be to work with an Emerging Advocacy Fund Grant from MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger to establish student food pantries at interested college campuses in the state.

Why is the Alliance needed?

Universities and colleges in Mississippi are all very different in their student populations, but are the same in that hunger plays a role on their campuses. They could use some help dealing with this problem, especially in setting up food pantries where students can find a reliable source of shelf-stable food. The first task of the Alliance is to offer advice and assistance in setting up these food pantries.

""(Southern Miss) has been through the ups and downs of running a food pantry,"" Hurst said. ""We can share our experiences and our resources so the campuses don't have to start from scratch.""

What has it done so far?

The Alliance visited the Eagle's Nest in September with officials from several other colleges and universities to see how it serves students. The Eagle's Nest has been open since October 2016 and offers donated food and other necessities to any student who needs them. The Alliance called it a ""model"" in the way it was organized and helps students.

During that visit, officials from Jackson State, who were in the process of setting up a food pantry, considered changing their mind about keeping students to a limited number of food items to allowing them to have what they need as Southern Miss does.

At the time of the Eagle's Nest visit, Moore said, ""Hopefully, we'll be able to duplicate this food pantry across Mississippi."" Moore liked that the Eagle's Nest didn't discriminate on the basis of need, was run by student-volunteers and offered low-fat proteins, low-sugar fruits and other healthy items.

What does it hope to accomplish?

The Alliance hopes to tackle more than just hunger, perhaps setting up emergency funds for students and other resources that can help them stay in school and graduate. But first, it wants to set up a food pantry on every community college and college campus in Mississippi.

Moore said it will take people working together to help because improving access to food and resources for college students is not a solitary endeavor.

""Partnering with others is very successful,"" he said. ""An alliance of people sharing resources is so much better than one person carrying the load.""

A pair of identical bills in both the Senate and the House of the 2020 Legislature sought to push the seiners at least half a mile off Cat Island, the last remaining island they could still fish.

“If they take Cat Island, all that’s left is one other little inside place where there are so many recreational fishermen and all that it gets run over eight or 10 times a day — there’s nothin’ there. And that’s what they’re wantin’ to leave us with,” said haul seiner Martin Young.

The state’s other four barrier islands have been off-limits to commercial fishermen since the 1990s, when managers of the federal Gulf Islands National Seashore pushed them at least one mile away; Cat Island is shared between federal, state and private owners.

“The legislation would make it harder for the average Mississippi consumer to obtain fresh, local sustainable seafood,"" said Ryan Bradley, executive director of the Mississippi Commercial Fishermen United. ""It would be a real food security problem for a state that has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire nation.”

The Coastal Conservation Association’s House Bill 561, sponsored by Rep. Timmy Ladner, passed 118-3 on March 11. The sportsmen’s Senate Bill 2720, sponsored by Sens. Mike Thompson, Scott DeLano and Phillip Moran, passed 50-2 on March 10. The bills had moved to the opposite chambers, but the Legislature shut down before they could be voted on.

Sen. Mike Thompson

Mississippi’s Commission on Marine Resources, the specialized panel charged with managing the state’s coastal resources, opposed the bills in an April 7 resolution to the Legislature: “The two legislative bills will unfairly and inequitably restrict the rights and equal access of the commercial fishing industry to the marine resources of the state of Mississippi,” wrote the five-member panel.

The CCA narrowly missed its target in 2018 when the commission was unable to break a tie vote.

WASHINGTON (CN) — Experts called it critical Monday that a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from leaving nearly 700,000 people without food stamps at a time of rising food insecurity with millions of Americans out of work during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ruling against the Department of Agriculture at summary judgment Sunday, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found that the rule it adopted late last year “radically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice” for administering food stamps through SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Howell slammed the agency as “icily silent” on how its proposal would affect more than 1 million people who receive SNAP benefits during a pandemic that so far has killed nearly 220,00 Americans and quadrupled the national unemployment rate.

Food insecurity is on the rise, meanwhile, and still climbing.

“The main frontline of defense that we have is SNAP,” Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center, told Courthouse News on Monday.

After the Great Recession, it took 10 years for the food-insecurity rate to get back to levels seen before the 2008 economic crash, she added.

“We don’t know exactly what this recovery will look like. But we know from prior experience that it takes a long time for people to dig out,” Waxman said.

Julia Henly, who chairs the doctoral program for the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, agreed that SNAP is proven to reduce food insecurity and is a critical economic support to low-income families.

“This is a time to simplify SNAP access, not make the eligibility process more difficult,” Henly said in an email Monday.

States historically have had the power to waive the work mandates that food-stamp beneficiaries face. Without court intervention, the Trump administration would have made such waivers harder to implement. In a thriving economy, noted Henly, such a move makes little sense.

“But it would be especially poor public policy to reinstate work mandates at a time when over 12 million Americans are unemployed and community food banks are stretched to the limit. This is precisely the time when SNAP benefits are most critical, without making their access conditional on work,” she said.

Economist Robert Hartley likewise called the rule a “strange juxtaposition” to the efforts of Congress, which through the CARES Act has suspended time limits on work requirements for so-called “able-bodied adults without dependents” who are eligible for relief under SNAP.

An estimated 700,000 such adults could have found themselves kicked off food stamps this year if the Trump administration’s rule had held up in court.

SNAP is “perhaps the most accessible and successful support” for American families facing economic hardship, a safety net made all the more valuable during the pandemic, Hartley said in an email.

“Restricting access as proposed would offer small savings in relative terms to government spending, but the personal hardship that would result is significant, especially since individuals’ constraints and health challenges may be difficult to observe as we label who is able-bodied,” said Hartley, who is an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University.

Judge Howell, an Obama appointee, had temporarily blocked the rule set to impose new eligibility requirements from taking effect on April 1, calling SNAP essential. In her 67-page ruling Sunday, Howell wrote that USDA had failed to explain how the changes followed the federal rulemaking process or “make sense.”

Just over the last six months, Howell added, “SNAP rosters have grown by over 17 percent with over 6 million new enrollees.”

While the rule change attempted by the Trump administration had targeted adults without dependents, Waxman noted that many food stamp recipients are noncustodial parents. Even if their children live with another parent, such individuals can still bear financial or caretaking responsibilities.

Waxman called SNAP a critical stimulus program that should not be pared back amid a deadly outbreak whose economic toll remains untold, pointing to research that shows every dollar spent in the program returns anywhere from $1.50 to $1.80 back to the recipient’s community.

“This is a program that helps fuel recoveries,” Waxman said. “It’s just a relief that this is one fewer battle that’ll have to be fought right now.”

The lawsuit was brought in January by attorneys general from 19 states as well as the District of Columbia and New York City.

“At a time of national crisis, this decision is a win for common sense and basic human decency,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a press release Monday. “This Trump administration rule was cruel to its core and ran counter to who we are and what we represent as a nation.”

Hartley noted Monday that New York was the first state to pilot a SNAP Online Purchasing program in 2019 that has rapidly expanded to 47 states since May.

Without SNAP, he added, the country would see “large increases in food insecurity, especially unprecedented spikes in child food insecurity, or else extreme lines at food banks or other distribution centers.”

21,21,"May 8, 2018",Vicksburg Post,Mississippi identified as most food insecure state in U.S. - The Vicksburg Post,"By Mississippi Today

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

More than 600,000 Mississippians, or approximately 20 percent of the state’s residents, had limited or uncertain access to healthy meals in 2016, the last year for which data was available. This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent. From 2012-16, it was the only state to reach that mark.

The study uses answers to Census questions on food security, as well as economic indicators such as unemployment, median income, poverty and home ownership rates, to determine food insecurity rates. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as having ample resources and access to healthy food options throughout the year.

Jefferson County, with 36 percent, had the highest rate of food insecurity in the country. Several other Mississippi counties also had high rates, including Holmes (35 percent), Claiborne (34 percent), Humphreys (34 percent) and Issaquena (33 percent).

“The Delta’s a main area, because it’s rural. You have a lot of people who live a lot of miles from the nearest grocery store,” said Charles Beady, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Food Network, a local partner of Feeding America that serves 430 agencies around the state.

“But that’s also true in our state capital here in Jackson. The majority of Jackson is a food desert,” Beady said. “Some 20 percent of people are under or at the poverty line, and a third of the people live a mile or more from a grocery store. So there are food deserts all over the state.”

Twenty-five percent of Hinds County is food insecure, while the national rate is 13 percent.

While nationally, as well as in Mississippi, food security has improved over the past few years, hunger is still a pressing issue, said Feeding America president Matt Knott.

“Feeding America is particularly concerned about the ongoing challenges facing rural and southern communities since the Great Recession,” Knott said. “While we are relieved that food insecurity rates have slightly declined in recent years, the total number of people facing hunger is still higher than it was before 2008.”

Even though the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other similar programs help alleviate food insecurity in many communities, 30 percent of people struggling with hunger in Mississippi earn too much money to qualify for SNAP benefits. In Mississippi, the cutoff salary for qualifying for SNAP is $15,782, or 130 percent of the federal poverty guideline.

And on April 12, some members of Congress introduced legislation, known as the Farm Bill, that would increase work requirements for people eligible for SNAP, National Public Radio reported. The bill’s supporters argue that mandatory job training will lead to increased employment and help reduce poverty.

“While the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks delivers more than four billion meals annually to people facing hunger, SNAP serves 12 meals for every one meal we provide,” Knott said. “As Congress debates the 2018 Farm Bill, SNAP must be protected and strengthened so that people facing hunger and working to re-establish independent lives have the essential food resources they need.”

We find a lot of people (in that gap) in the work that we do, just making too much money to qualify (for food assistance programs) and not enough money to feed your family,” Beady said. “If you’re talking about upping the (work) requirement, that means you’re probably going to put more people in the category of hungry and food insecure, which means our job will be even greater than it is now.”

In addition to food insecurity rates, the report maps the average meal price and percent of hungry people in the income gap of every county in the country.","This is the eighth edition of Feeding America’s annual report, titled Map the Meal Gap, and each year Mississippi had the highest rate of food insecurity, hovering around 20 percent.

22,22,"May 22, 2020",Marketplace.org,“Record levels” of food insecurity in the U.S. because of COVID-19,"At some point this year, 54 million Americans — including one in four children — may not know where their next meal is coming from.

Food insecurity is rising in every part of the United States, and will continue to throughout 2020, according to new projections out this week from Feeding America.

“These are record levels,” said Emily Engelhard, managing director of research at Feeding America, which has a nationwide network of food banks. “We have not seen food insecurity reach these levels for the length of time that food insecurity has been measured.”

Some of the biggest increases are coming in states that rely heavily on tourism, like Nevada and Hawaii, which have been hit hard by pandemic-related job-losses. And the need is only continuing to grow in the states that had the highest rates of food insecurity before the pandemic, including Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana.

“Sometimes we have a tendency to feel like the issue of food insecurity is not our issue, and that it’s far away. It’s in some other neighborhood, in some other community,” Engelhard said. “But this really shows that it’s in every single community.”

More than 37 million people were already considered food insecure before COVID-19 arrived in the U.S. and devastated the economy — and that was the lowest it had been since before the Great Recession.

Since the earliest days of the pandemic, food banks across the country have been seeing a surge in demand, something they often measure in pounds. One meal is roughly 1.2 pounds, according to Catherine D’Amato, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Before the pandemic, the Greater Boston Food Bank was distributing between 4 and 5 million pounds of food a month, on average.

In March, it distributed 8 million pounds.

In April, 9.5 million pounds.

In May, it’s on track to distribute more than 10 million pounds.

“That’s a very clear indicator that something is different,” D’Amato said. “It’s historic, we’ve never seen anything like this. So there’s no roadmap for us, and we’re kind of building it.”

Projected rates of food insecurity for 2020 by state, according to Feeding America’s report, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Security. (Courtesy Feeding America)

Around 40% of the increase is coming from people who had never been to a food bank before, according to Feeding America — people who have newly lost a job, or are supporting sick family members.

With unemployment continuing to rise every week — nearly 39 million people have applied for benefits for the first time just in the last two months — food banks know that need is only going to continue to increase, and is likely to remain high for a long time.

“Are we going to be in this for five years? Are we going to be in this for three years?” D’Amato said. “We know we’re going to be in this for multiple years simply based on these historic unemployment numbers.”

So far, there has been a surge in donations, both from individuals and corporations, that is helping food banks meet the increase in demand.

But, Engelhard said, “my concern is that this will become a new normal, and that the sort of energy and community support that we’re seeing won’t sustain, even as people continue to be in dire need of support.”

COVID-19 Economy FAQs How are those COVID relief payments affecting consumers? Payments started going out within days of President Joe Biden signing the American Rescue Plan, and that’s been a big shot in the arm for consumers, said John Leer at Morning Consult, which polls Americans every day. “Consumer confidence is really on a tear. They are growing more confident at a faster rate than they have following the prior two stimulus packages.” Leer said this time around the checks are bigger and they’re getting out faster. Now, rising confidence is likely to spark more consumer spending. But Lisa Rowan at Forbes Advisor said it’s not clear how much or how fast. Will more people be working from home once the worst of the pandemic recedes? It’s still unclear whether remote work will remain widespread, but there is at least more data analyzing the costs and benefits of working from home. People might be saving on things like commuting and buying clothes, but they’re also finding that in order to make long-term remote work feasible, they’ll have to upgrade their living spaces. And that cost could outweigh savings. Chris Stanton, a Harvard business professor, said even a minor increase in working from home after the pandemic could add up to billions of dollars a year for workers. I’m hearing a lot about interest rates. Is it getting more expensive to borrow money? Expectations of higher inflation as the economy rebounds have investors demanding higher yields to compensate. In turn, the recent surge in bond yields is pushing up the interest rates consumers pay on mortgages and other loans. Economist Scott Hoyt with Moody’s Analytics said rising rates could dampen demand for housing a little and refinancing a little more. Other kinds of consumer spending are less likely to be affected. Interest on auto loans and credit cards are pegged to shorter-term rates, which haven’t been rising as much.

23,23,"Oct 11, 2020",The Commercial Dispatch,MSU maintains partnership with Nobel Peace Prize winner,"The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

The World Food Program, a United Nations agency, works to provide food for undernourished populations, particularly in countries at war. The MSU Office of Public Affairs issued a congratulatory statement from university president Mark Keenum in a Saturday press release.

“Addressing hunger and promoting food security is key to facilitating peace and stability across the world,” Keenum said. “That is why organizations like the World Food Program are so important to ensuring a peaceful future, and why I have made global food security a focal point of our research and outreach efforts at MSU. Feeding a growing global population is a massive challenge, and this Nobel Peace Prize underscores the need to continue our role in the global fight against hunger.”

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could bring the number of people facing “acute food insecurity” up to 265 million worldwide, according to an April press release from WFP.

MSU and WFP have worked together since 2010 “on issues related to food safety and nutrition,” MSU Chief Communications Officer Sid Salter said. The two entities signed an agreement in 2014 to focus on “cooperative efforts in areas such as nutrition, food safety, and food product development,” according to the press release.

Keenum and two other MSU leaders — Provost David Shaw and Interim Vice President for Research Julie Jordan — with U.N. leaders in Rome in November 2019 to discuss solutions to global food insecurity.

MSU invests $105 million, the eleventh-most nationwide, in agricultural sciences research and development, according to the National Science Foundation.

MSU also is the headquarters and leading institution in the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish, an aquaculture research organization funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The lab focuses on building sustainable fish farming systems in countries around the world to alleviate food insecurity.

Keenum is the chairman of both the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory board to the United States Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research. Before becoming MSU’s president in 2009, Keenum was a USDA undersecretary in charge of overseeing international initiatives to combat world hunger.

He wrote a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in January 2016 nominating WFP for that year’s Nobel Peace Prize. In the letter, which Salter provided to The Dispatch, Keenum pointed out WFP’s work to provide “millions of healthy school meals and supplementary nutrition” to children suffering from nutrient deficiencies “in the most destitute parts of the world.”

“All of us, and particularly the developed countries, have a moral obligation to address the persistent human tragedy of hunger and its associated ills,” Keenum wrote. “We must also recognize that lasting peace among and within nations is likely impossible while large populations remain at risk of starvation.”

WFP provided nutritional assistance to nearly 100 million people in 88 countries in 2019, with some of its largest efforts focused on Yemen and South Sudan. Founded in 1961, the organization has helped populations affected by a range of humanitarian crises, including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and wars in the Balkan region of Eastern Europe in the 1990s.","The 2020 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, announced on Friday, has a longstanding working relationship with Mississippi State University.

JACKSON — For the eighth straight year, Mississippi has been identified as the most food insecure state in the country, according to a report released this week by Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that delivers more than four billion meals annually to people who consistently suffer from hunger.

25,25,"Jun 10, 2020",Civil Eats,"‘Fertile Ground’ Explores How Jackson, Mississippi, Is Charting a Better Food Future","Obesity. Poverty. Food Insecurity.

Mississippi has the dubious distinction of ranking high nationally in each of these interlinked categories. With the exception of New Mexico, the Magnolia State is the most food insecure place in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents. The film, directed by Alex Warren, with executive producer Robby Piantanida, airs tonight at 7 p.m. Central Time on Mississippi PBS and is also available online at PBS.org.

“There is no justification for anyone to go hungry or anyone to not have access to healthy food options,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement about the film. “In many respects, food is love in our communities. Food is a reflection of how we demonstrate our appreciation for people.”

Fertile Ground, which was funded in part by a grant from the Bloomberg Foundation, shows how historic redlining—a practice in which banks prevented people of color from buying mortgages in white neighborhoods—resulted in the mostly Black and impoverished neighborhood of South Jackson having few grocery stores but several convenience stores with low-quality food. The city’s car culture and lack of sidewalks and bicycle lanes add to the problem, making it a herculean task for residents without vehicles to obtain nutrient-rich food. And children in Jackson’s most economically disadvantaged areas rely on school cafeterias to get balanced meals. In Mississippi, 1 in 4 children experiences hunger, compared to 1 in 5 adults.

In the wake of these challenges, urban farms, city planning projects, farm-to-table restaurants, and efforts to provide residents with locally grown food offer hope that food equality in Jackson is possible. Fertile Ground isn’t just a film, but an initiative that aims to shape policy and public dialogue about food access and nutrition through art, workshops, panel discussions, and other events.

Civil Eats spoke with Jackson chef Enrika Williams, a Fertile Ground workshop facilitator, and Travis Crabtree, a Jackson-based urban designer and Fertile Ground project manager, about the new documentary, redlining, urban farming, and the food inequities their city faces.

How does the layout of Jackson contribute to food inequality?

Travis Crabtree. Travis Crabtree.

Travis Crabtree: Whenever you have a city that is extremely car oriented, obviously you have accessibility issues, especially when you have neighborhoods that don’t have good public transportation, low car ownership, and no sidewalks—which is the reality for a lot of Jackson. Jackson started being built from the core, which is downtown Jackson, and then over time, you had white flight and people started to leave the city. That’s when all the grocery stores left.

It’s a very typical pattern in American cities. It has happened all over the country, but Jackson is a place that’s already dealing with extreme poverty, racial tensions, and [less] access to resources. When it comes to food insecurity, it’s super exacerbated here.

The documentary discusses how poverty in some Jackson neighborhoods played a role in supermarkets leaving. Why do you think that is?

Enrika Williams. Enrika Williams.

Enrika Williams: You can find plenty of convenience stores that have decided to take EBT because people in the community who are using food assistance need a place to spend their money so they can eat. But the larger grocery store chains are in the business of making money, and capitalists are not empathetic to anything but . . . making money. So, if the majority of the people who come into your stores are on some sort of public assistance, you look at the bottom line and think, “I’m not making any money.”

I also think there’s a stigma attached to public assistance recipients. Stores don’t want to appear to be accommodating to a demographic of EBT recipients. There’s also an insurance standpoint: It costs more to put your grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. It’s like another form of redlining.

How does the history of redlining play a role in the city’s present-day food landscape?

Crabtree: It’s really clear what lines divide Jackson—the train yard, the interstate, and these other sorts of urban barriers, even institutions like colleges or hospitals. They act as really large barriers that are disconnecting the white neighborhoods from Black neighborhoods. And generally the white neighborhoods are the ones that have the grocery stores and are more affluent.

Redlining obviously exists in most American cities, but it’s so apparent here. One thing that we’ve done outside of the documentary is we have a major public art component. We’ve tried to position our public art installations at the intersections of the redlines to bring the two communities together. We’re putting them right up against the railroad tracks and the different sort of segregation points to try to have conversations about what an integrated Jackson would be like.","The short documentary Fertile Ground chronicles the fight for food equality in the capital city of Jackson and the efforts of activists, farmers, lawmakers, and other advocates to make healthy food accessible to all residents.

A small rural town in Amite County, Gloster is just south of the Homochitto National Forest in southwest Mississippi; it’s less than two square miles in size and home to around a thousand residents, according to the 2016 American Community Survey.

Companies are scared, despite minimal competition, that they won’t make enough of a profit to survive in towns with a small consumer base — towns like Gloster. In a sparsely populated state like Mississippi, this is a common dilemma, especially when it comes to access to food.

But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving. The town’s first grocery store in decades.

“We needed this,” said Felecia Nayland, 56, who’s lived in Gloster all her life. I just hope and pray that they continue to do good business here so they’ll stay here.”

Nayland said previously, access to fruits and vegetables in town was “pretty much non-existent.”

Limited access to grocery stores in rural areas is one reason Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Over half a million Mississippians did not know where their next meal would come from between 2015 and 2017, according to the latest report from Hunger Free America, “The Red, White, and Blue Hunger Wave: A 2018 United States Hunger Atlas.”

Many here see the public-private partnership that brought the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Gloster as part of the solution to an all-too-common problem in rural towns around the state — availability of affordable, fresh food.

Lavonne Sanders, 50, has also lived in Gloster her whole life, and said the last time the town had a store like this was when she was a little girl, about 30-40 years ago. That too was a Piggly Wiggly.

“I love this store, it’s made a big change,” Sanders said. “We don’t have to go Centreville anymore. You don’t have to spend that gas money now.”

While the store licenses the Piggly Wiggly brand, the shop itself is independently owned and operated by Jason Cook. Cook, from Hattiesburg, learned about Gloster a few years ago while at a previous job. The company was considering expansion into the small town, but in the end opted against it. Since then, Cook opened a Piggly Wiggly in Angie, La. — but he didn’t forget about Gloster.

“I came back here when I was financially able to,” Cook said, “just because after having talks with the community I knew how bad it was here. So the Lord led us back here.

“Most companies will turn their nose up at a store doing under $100,000 a week in sales. My approach is a little different; I do it to operate a business, but I also do it out of just having humanity and compassion. The way I do things aren’t necessarily the way anyone else does them.”

The city approved a tax incentive for the store, which will reimburse Cook for exterior improvements like the parking lot and sidewalk repair. Cook said without the community’s responsiveness and support, including the financial help, the Piggly Wiggly likely wouldn’t have opened. The store created 22 jobs.

“If you can get into a town where the government will help you get established there to lower your overhead (cost), then you can make it,” Cook said. “You don’t get greedy, and you don’t take advantage of people, you just operate. I live within my means. I’ve got to make a profit in order to pay the bills, but I’m not trying to become a millionaire off of it.”

After years of driving out of town, often out of county, to find fresh produce and essentials, residents were prepared to fill Piggly Wiggly; by 3 p.m. on a Monday, the grocery store was the busiest place in Gloster.

“It’s brought some life back to the town,” said Rachel Stevens, 54, who works at a business on Main St. around the corner from the new store.

Stevens and other residents discussed having to cram all their grocery shopping into a couple trips a month.

“We’d have to stock up. It’s really inconvenient when you run out of stuff. We had no choice, no options,” she added.

More than just the convenience, residents think the Piggly Wiggly will lift spirits and create momentum for the town.

“The grocery store may just be enough,” said Bradley Bruce, a Chicagoan who moved to Gloster eight years ago. “I knew it was hyped up when people, even in the other counties, would say, ‘Did you hear about the Piggly Wiggly?’ It’s the biggest thing in a long time in this area.”

“It’s gonna be some more changes coming,” Sanders said. “I believe.”

“To hear over the course of several years how badly a grocery store was needed and wanted in the town, and now that the town finally has it, it really is a feeling of bliss and happiness,” said Rep. Angela Cockerham, D-Magnolia, who represents Amite County.

Cockerham, an attorney at Wise Carter, also serves as Gloster’s lawyer. She added that the incentives Piggly Wiggly received could help attract business in other places in Mississippi.

“In the future, I’m hoping that there will be other mechanisms that will help areas like Southwest Mississippi that encourage partnership (between towns and businesses),” she said.

Statewide solutions and the Legislature’s role

Much of the state — about 1 in 5, according to Hunger Free America — struggle with consistent access to nutritional food.

The phenomenon ranges from urban areas, like Hinds County, where 1 in 4 are food insecure, to rural areas like Jefferson County, which had the highest food insecurity rate in the country in 2016 at 36 percent, according to Feeding America.

Can the public-private partnership in Gloster work in the rest of the state? What can the state Legislature do to help?

Every year, lawmakers propose legislation ultimately aimed at reducing food insecurity by either helping grocers located in low-income communities mitigate losses or making groceries more affordable for the general public.

Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Jackson, has pushed for legislation to give tax credits to grocers locating in underserved communities. A 2018 bill would have given these stores a job tax credit equaling 10 percent of its payroll.

Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, authored a 2018 bill to give income tax credits to grocers to offset the cost of purchasing locally grown produce in an attempt to incentivize stores offering healthier food options.

Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, has introduced bills for the last several years to allow state funds to be used as a direct source of funding for grocery stores under the Small Business and Grocer Investment Act passed in 2014.

Each of these bills died in committee with little fanfare.

Simmons said his proposal to use state dollars directly is unlikely to garner the support of leadership. Tax incentives, similar to those Mississippi gives large companies like Nissan and Continental Tire, might be more palatable, Simmons said.

Right now, Mississippi is leveraging tax incentives for industries to locate in the state, but those benefits do not apply to businesses like grocers.

“Because of the number of employees, the kind of wages they’re paying, (grocers) wouldn’t qualify for the same type of incentives that an industry would,” Simmons said.

The federal government’s primary vehicle for providing at least some food to the poor is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly allowances based on the size of the recipient’s household. Mississippi has one of the largest federal matches of any state for these assistance programs.

“We in Mississippi have depended so much on the federal government to feed the hungry in the state that we ourselves are not focused on it,” Simmons said. “We have not stepped up to the plate to give adequate dollars to match that to help those citizens out of their particular situation … We’ve not had to.”

To slightly ease the burden of affording groceries for Mississippi residents, Rep. Jeramey Anderson, D-Escatawpa, repeatedly proposes legislation to remove the sales tax levied on food items for all shoppers. SNAP purchases are already exempt from sales tax. A version of the same bill from Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, would have also increased all other sales tax from seven to nine percent.

“In my opinion, the best way to provide a tax cut to our constituents, especially those in the middle and working class, is to eliminate this sales tax (on food),” said Anderson, who plans on reintroducing the bill next session. “And I know that of course there has to be a make-up of the revenue lost from taxes on groceries, but I think phasing it out, which is what this bill does over five years, is a responsible way of doing that without hitting the state’s revenue so hard. I think the sales tax on groceries is one of, if not the most, regressive taxes we have.”

Both bills also died, as well as several bills to raise the state minimum wage, which currently mirrors the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, to between $8.25 and $10.10.

Considering low wages across the state, Mississippi families cannot always rely on a job to provide food security. The “U.S. Hunger Atlas” also shows that nearly 13 percent of working adults, or 156,213 employees, also faced food insecurity between 2015 and 2017.

The report also calculated that Mississippi residents would need to spend an additional $273 million each year on food to meet their basic nutritional needs. That’s roughly one-third the amount Mississippi spent, $841.8 million, through the SNAP program in 2017.

“When you get into a situation and you do it for so long, it just becomes a way of life,” Simmons said. “If we do more at the state level, we could actually become a state of change, where we are transitioning our people from poverty to prosperity.”

At the Mississippi Center for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on racial and economic issues, Madeline Morcelle and Kathryn Rehner promote a wide-range of solutions to tackle the root causes of food insecurity.

“In order to achieve a food secure Mississippi, the state legislature will need to take on a broad range of social, economic, and physical barriers to healthy food access,” Morcelle said. “Those include everything from poverty, which is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of people still aren’t paid a living wage; measures to improve the minimum wage would improve food security. I think tax incentives and other measures to incentivize investments from food retailers are important.

“Ultimately, though, there isn’t one solution. It will take a combination of state reform addressing the multiplicity of factors that result in food insecurity, from lack of transportation, to inadequate income, to lack of opportunity in many communities, to protecting and strengthening our essential nutritional assistance programs like SNAP that provide that emergency lifeline to struggling families.”","But a few weeks ago, a welcome newcomer moved into town: an independently owned Piggly Wiggly grocery store arrived in the heart of Gloster, just in time for Thanksgiving.

29,29,"Nov 12, 2020",,Some U.S. states hit harder by COVID-19 food insecurity,"Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic. But large regional differences exist in the severity of the impact.

Experts project over 50 million Americans will be food insecure in 2020, including about 17 million children, says Craig Gundersen, ACES distinguished professor in the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois.

Gundersen estimated food insecurity using Map the Meal Gap, an interactive model he developed for Feeding America, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks in the U.S. For the current report, he combined MMG data with projected unemployment numbers.

""One of the key things about COVID-19 is how there's differential impacts across the country and by demographic groups. People with college education generally have not seen much of an impact on either unemployment rates or incomes. However, people in lower-wage jobs tend to be impacted a lot more,"" Gundersen states. ""We would expect greater impact of COVID-19 in areas with a high concentration of service industry jobs.""

The report finds the hardest hit states are the same as before the pandemic -- Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico - but with higher rates. Jefferson County, Mississippi, has the highest food insecurity rate, 30.4%, in the country.

However, the pandemic disproportionately affected other states. For example, Nevada jumped from 20th to eighth highest food insecurity rate by state.

""Areas like Nevada, which has a strong emphasis on the service industry and tourism, will have substantially higher rates of increase in food insecurity than areas with fewer service sector workers,"" Gundersen says.

These findings can help direct relief efforts, he notes.

""Resources should continue to be directed towards those areas with greater needs before, during, and after COVID-19. But we also have to recognize that during the pandemic situation there are areas of the country, such as Nevada, which may need more emergency assistance in the near term,"" Gundersen says.

""Furthermore, some of these jobs may not come back; tourism may be permanently down in the United States. So these impacts could also have longer term ramifications,"" he concludes.","Food insecurity in America is reaching an all-time high during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During World War II, approximately 40% of recruits couldn’t enlist due to poor nutrition. Today, over 70% of would-be recruits are ineligible for a number of contributing factors, including nutrition and obesity. It’s become a matter of national security, according to an organization of retired generals.

""Seventy years ago, a military leader said a lack of nutritional food in our children and young adults contributed to military readiness,"" said retired Army Maj. Gen. Larry Harrington. ""We've made some improvements but we have a long, long way to go.""

Mission: Readiness is a national group made up of over 75 retired admirals and general across the country that focuses on helping children stay in school, in shape and out of trouble. The organization issued a report Wednesday, Improving Childhood Nutrition in Mississippi, that highlighted the need for federally funded programs that give children access to fresh and healthy food.

Wednesday morning, three generals from Mission: Readiness met with agencies from across Mississippi in a roundtable discussion in Jackson about child nutrition.

Nationally, 72% of those 17 to 24 years old are not able to qualify for the military due to lack of education, criminal background, substance abuse or medical disqualifiers. Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility in the nation, with 76% of eligible 17- to 24- year-olds not being able to qualify, said retired Army Brig. Gen. Roger Shields.

Obesity is one of the leading disqualifiers, he said. Twenty-five percent of 10- to 17- year-olds were obese in the state in 2018, while 40% of adults were obese.

""We believe that America must prioritize efforts to combat childhood obesity as a matter of national security,"" Shields said in a written statement released after the roundtable. ""Improving access to fresh and nutritious foods for all children will help reduce childhood obesity and ultimately ensure that the military has a pool of recruits.""

There is a ""network"" of federal nutrition programs available across Mississippi working to combat the issue but many don't know what is available to them, said retired Army Maj. Gen. Augustus Collins, a former adjutant general of Mississippi.

Collins cited the National School Lunch Program, Summer Food Service Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

(Story continues after photo gallery.)

According to the Mission: Readiness report, in 1945, Gen. Lewis Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, testified in front of Congress that at least 40% of recruits were rejected during World War II for reasons released to poor nutrition.

The National School Lunch program was founded the following year ""to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals,"" Collins said.

Recalling Hershey's testimony, Collins said, ""The lack of nutritious food for our children is actually a threat to national security.""

""It was back in World War II and it is today,"" he said.

Statistics: Nutrition, obesity and the military

In Mississippi, 76% of youth between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot serve in the military due to issues such as lack of education, a record of crime or substance abuse, or medical disqualifiers; higher than the national average of 71%.

Mississippi has the highest rate of ineligibility among all 50 states.

Obesity is one of the main medical disqualifiers. Individuals who would otherwise be eligible to serve in the military are being disqualified due to excess weight.

In Mississippi, nearly 40% of adults and 25% of children ages 10-17 were obese in 2018, the highest in the nation. In some counties, the percentage increases to 45.

Mississippi has the second highest rate of child food insecurity in the country. In 2016, over 24% of Mississippi children experienced food insecurity. The national average is 18 percent.

Between 2015 and 2017, over 17% of all households in Mississippi experienced food insecurity.

Children who experience food insecurity are at a higher rate for obesity.

Mississippi has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country at 17%.

In Mississippi, 37,000 participants, or 7% of National School Lunch Program participants, accessed the Summer Food Service Program, meaning a large majority of students may not have access to healthy food during the summer break.

The hardest-hit groups are Black and Latino households, as well as low-income individuals.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Food insecurity is nothing new in the US, but the coronavirus pandemic has exasperated the problem.

Mass layoffs and furloughs have led to more Americans unsure about how they will put food on the table in the coming months.

A pre-pandemic study by the USDA shows ""37.2 million people, including 11.2 million children, did not have adequate access to nutritious food to live a healthy life.""

Based of data from that study, Feeding America estimates the number is "" likely to grow by 17 million, including nearly seven million children.""

These disparities are drawn between strong racial and economic divides.

In the US, Latino residents are two times more likely to suffer from food inequality than their white counterparts; Black residents are two-and-a-half times more likely.

This goes hand-in-hand with food deserts, which are more common in areas with a large Latino or Black population.

""It's not new, even though with COVID-19 we've seen an increase in food insecurity overall, and it seems like people of color again are disproportionately impacted,"" Angela Odoms-Young, associate professor in the department of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Bloomberg.

""Eight of the 10 counties with the highest food-insecurity rates are more than 60% Black,"" according to the Feeding America report.

Jefferson County, Mississippi, and Issaquena County, Mississippi will experience the highest rates of food insecurity this year, at 34.2% and 33.9%, respectively. This comes after Issaquena County didn't report a single case of coronavirus until after May 1.

Mississippi also has some of the lowest unemployment benefits in the US, at an average of $213 a week.

There is also no sign of relief coming soon. The federal unemployment benefit of $600 a week lapsed at the end of July, and Congress has not yet signed a deal for a new stimulus package.","54 million people in the US will face food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America.

36,36,"Dec 1, 2020",Ole Miss News,Center for Population Studies and Partners Host Hunger Summit,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s Center for Population Studies has partnered with two regional community organizations to launch the 2020 Hunger Summit, which provides a venue for community organizations and their partners to share information and support during the pandemic.

Partners in the effort are the Delta Directions Consortium and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. Starting in September, the Hunger Summit has convened the first Thursday of each month via Zoom.

“The Hunger Summit has been a great success,” said Terrence Hunter, fellow of the Delta Directions Consortium and alumnus of the Ole Miss School of Law who has moderated each of the sessions. “It is amazing seeing so many food pantries and food banks come together with a unified mission: combating food insecurity in the Mississippi Delta in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The concept for the Hunger Summit stems from a previous collaboration between the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Center for Population Studies. The first Desoto County Hunger Summit was held in Hernando in 2017.

This year’s summit was born out of a broader initiative between foundations and university entities to find out how food pantries and nonprofits were operating in the midst of the pandemic. The Maddox Foundation, Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi, partners within the Delta Directions Consortium and the UM Community First Research Center for Wellbeing and Creative Achievement joined forces to conduct social science, public health and legal research that would help pantries and other organizations providing food assistance to Mississippi families.

Before the pandemic, the Center for Population Studies, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi were already collaborating to identify challenges and opportunities in several north Mississippi communities, with the goal of building capacity and promoting community health and well-being.

With the onset of the pandemic, the focus narrowed to the critical and time-sensitive issues of addressing food insecurity and hunger in these communities.

“What began as a project for the future really turned out to be extremely impactful in the present,” said Robin Hurdle, president and CEO of the Maddox Foundation. “As schools and businesses closed, emergency resources and critical funding were desperately needed, and the homework done by so many for our original proposal laid the groundwork necessary to make the FEED Fund possible.”

The FEED Northwest Mississippi Fund was established at the Community Foundation to enable pantries and nonprofits to become self-sustaining.

Through the fund, the Maddox Foundation and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi have worked to raise and distribute money to allow food pantries and other organizations to serve more Mississippians in need and invest in their future. The fund has granted nearly $800,000 to nonprofits that are working to meet the academic, educational and nutritional needs of children.

With the Hunger Summit, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi and the Delta Directions Consortium have been able to bring donors and nonprofits together to find innovative ways to meet the needs that Mississippians are experiencing as a result of the pandemic.

“The Hunger Summit has brought synergy to the foundation’s efforts to address the food insecurity needs in our region,” said Keith Fulcher, president of the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. “Partnerships have been formed with state, national and even international organizations whose mission is to feed the hungry.

STARKVILLE, Miss. —More than a dozen high school students participated in the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute on Friday [March 23] at Mississippi State University.

Hosted by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, students from across Mississippi spent the day engaged in conversation about global food security with their peers, teachers, MSU faculty and administrators and various food security experts.

Attendees were officially designated Borlaug Scholars for their participation and are eligible for scholarships to Mississippi State University. The Borlaug Scholars pay tribute to the World Food Prize’s founder Norman E. Borlaug. To become a Borlaug Scholar, each student wrote a research paper about a developing country and a food security topic. Each project included innovative ways to improve global food security. The students presented their findings at the on-campus event.

“The Mississippi Youth Institute is a partnership program with the World Food Prize. It challenges high school students to explore the world’s most pressing issues related to food security,” said Libby Crimmings, the World Food Prize’s national education program director. “The World Food Prize’s founder, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was passionate about working with students. He believed if you want people solving these challenges when they are 60 years old, they have to be thinking about it when they are 16 years old.”

MSU President Mark E. Keenum, a global food security champion, welcomed the students in an opening session.

“By 2050, the world population will surpass 10 billion. That means we will need to feed an additional 3 billion people at our global dinner table by the time this class of Borlaug Scholars reaches their 40s,” Keenum said. “That’s why we need young talented students like this who take an interest in the future of the world to try and make a difference, serve humanity and address these critical challenges.”

“It’s also why Mississippi State, as a leading land-grant research institution trained on improving food security on a global scale, is tackling many of these problems today. We are trying to address these challenges through science and research to figure out how we can advance productivity so we can feed the world.” Keenum added.

Scott Willard, associate dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, along with support from the entire MSU Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine administration, has been instrumental in seeing this institute come to fruition.

“Our college is thrilled to host the second annual World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute. Achieving global food security is essential as it becomes evident that we must feed more people with fewer resources,” Willard said. “This program provides a platform for high school students to formulate novel solutions to help solve one of the most pressing needs of their generation.”

Students also attended the college’s Charles E. Lindley Lecture. Charles H. Beady Jr., CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, presented on hunger in the Magnolia State. His presentation, “Mississippi: The Hungriest State in the Nation” explained how MFN is addressing food insecurity.

Top students from World Food Prize Mississippi Youth Institute will be invited to the Global Youth Institute in Iowa in October. Participating students also are eligible to apply to the Borlaug Ruan International Internship and the USDA Wallace-Carver Fellowship.

38,38,"Jun 10, 2020",Mississippi Today,How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemic,"‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemic

June 10, 2020

When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

“It wasn’t, ‘Oh my gosh how are we going to teach these kids?’ It was, ‘Oh my gosh these kids are going to starve without these meals,’” said Sunny Baker, co-director of the Mississippi Farm to School Network.

Before coronavirus, schools were a dependable place for thousands of children to receive a free and nutritious breakfast and lunch. The pandemic made this service even more crucial, as school buildings closed this spring and the virus wreaked havoc on the state and the nation’s economy, putting many parents’ jobs and economic futures in peril.

In Mississippi, 75 percent of children qualify for free or reduced meals, which means they live in households with income levels between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line. Because of this, the majority of children are dependent on the free breakfast and lunch they get at school everyday. When schools abruptly closed, so did that food supply.

“We just have such a large population in Mississippi of students who depend on those meals,” said Scott Clements, state director of child nutrition at the Mississippi Department of Education. “That breakfast and that lunch is the most nutritious meal they’ll get and in some cases, the only meal they’ll get during the course of the day.”

Gov. Tate Reeves made the decision to close school buildings and switch to distance learning on March 19, which means most school districts sprung into action immediately upon their return from spring break.

In the weeks since, school nutrition departments have had to pivot to alternative methods to ensure students receive food, whether it be a grab-and-go format, school bus door stop delivery, or drive-up exchanges.

More than 4.65 million meals have been served from mid-March through April (May figures are not available yet), Clements said. On any given day during the academic year, more than 100 school districts offered grab-and-go meals at more than 350 sites, not counting the 14 nonprofits that served meals at an additional 53 sites. Schools are still serving during the summer; the number of districts and sites change daily, as schools are constantly making decisions about which locations and days of the week to continue serving while also keeping workers and families safe.

“We say that all the time during the course of the school year, we really love to see a child eat breakfast in the morning because they’re better prepared to learn that day,” Clements said. “We like to see them eat lunch because they’re not going to be hungry and distracted in the afternoon. The same goes for right now — we’re trying to do distance learning and I think it’s important to make sure the nutrition is right so that they are healthy and even though (learning) shifted to home, they’re still able to learn.”

In some cases, local school districts have stopped serving meals because of the coronavirus. The West Bolivar School District, for example, paused delivery for about a month for this reason. They were delivering meals to students along the bus route in an effort to reach kids in the most rural areas of the county. But when one of the food service staff contracted the coronavirus, the meal provisions had to stop immediately, said Jackie Lloyd, school board president.

Small towns that West Bolivar School District served like Shaw — where the only sources of food are one restaurant, two gas stations, and a Dollar General — were suddenly left to figure out how to bridge the gap of keeping kids fed.

“You go to [Dollar General] one day, the shelves are just bare. It’s a whole community of people trying to get the small amount that’s available. So it’s very hard for them, especially our elderly, to be able to survive and get adequate nutrition that they need during this time,” said Cora Jackson, who was born and raised in Shaw.

In Shaw’s case, the nonprofit Delta Hands for Hope stepped in.

“Delta Hands for Hope has been a pillar in Shaw for the past five to six years. Because our focus is on youth, there’s no way that I could not do something for these children,” said Chiquikta Fountain, executive director and sole employee of Delta Hands for Hope.

From Day One volunteers like Jackson, her husband, and a group of students showed up to assemble meals. Donors contributed money and meal boxes toward the effort. Delta Hands for Hope, which before the pandemic provided children with educational resources after school, now serves lunch to around 65 kids three days a week. Even with these efforts, they’re still not able to reach all of the children in Shaw who are enrolled in West Bolivar School District.

While the need for a reliable, nutritious food source has become a glaring issue during the time of this pandemic, the problem of food insecurity is not new.

“Food pantries are an emergency solution to a huge problem here. They’re a Band-Aid. All of this hunger talk and hunger work to me is going to be for naught if we’re not talking about changing the system in which hunger exists,” Baker, the co-director of Mississippi Farm to School Network, said.

That system in which hunger exists hinges on long-held economic policies that don’t promote the buying and selling of locally grown produce.

Mississippi’s agricultural “focus on export commodities appears to have led state officials, and educational institutions, to overlook the potential for creating new economic activity — and farm and food business ownership — through local foods,” states a report produced for the Mississippi Food Policy Council.

The same report estimates that Mississippi imports nearly 90 percent of its food, while exporting on a large scale commodity crops that have to be processed, like soybeans.

“We have this incredibly rich soil. The Mississippi Delta is the richest soil in the country. And we’re not growing food there. We’re growing commodity crops — stuff that people can’t eat,” Baker said. “We’re not supporting small scale farmers. In fact, there are many policies and legislation that prevent small farmers from doing what they need to do.”

This is just one of the factors contributing to what is commonly referred to as hunger in Mississippi. In this sense, hunger doesn’t necessarily mean starving to death. It means not knowing where the next meal will come from or not being able to access healthy, affordable food.

“There are people here who may not be starving like we see on TV where you have children who are malnourished. Starvation looks a different way. Having access to food looks totally different than what you think it does … There’s food, but it’s processed food. You may even have cooked food (from a gas station or restaurant), but you don’t know where that came from,” Fountain said.

Eddye Johnson, food service director in the Coahoma County School District, is also well aware of this problem. She knew it would be hard for students to get a nutritious meal — her concerns stemmed from the lack of healthy meals students eat rather than access to the food itself.

“A lot of these children can’t go in there and cook, so they might be hungry or eating (Ramen) noodles up until their parents come home. Every now and then I think about that. I try to do my best to make sure I do all I can to make sure each child gets a decent meal and something nutritious,” Johnson said.

On a statewide level, the department of education worked with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to secure additional funding for families. The Pandemic EBT Program (P-EBT) was passed by the federal government in March as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and gives the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture the authority to approve statewide plans for temporary assistance to ensure that “children continue to have access to nutritious meals despite this national emergency.”

To date, 41 states have been approved, Mississippi included. The program serves 340,980 students to the tune of $90 million, or about $5.40 per student per day. The funding is retroactive, meaning it would cover the time from the date schools closed due to the pandemic (March 19) through the end of the school year (May 22).

The pandemic has also changed the way food is distributed. Ensuring the safety of employees and the greater communities they serve has led some districts to go from five days a week to one or two.

Cartons of milk for each child in some cases are now gallons, so families don’t have to come back repeatedly and increase contact and exposure. Before the virus, districts may have ordered large tins of canned peaches or strawberries; now they’re distributed in single-serve cups, Clements said.

“It’s a very different process from having 800 kids come through a serving line where you’re constantly being backfilled from the kitchen,” Clements, the state nutrition director, said. “Even though the numbers may be smaller, it’s tough to feed say, 400 kids in a serving line when you’ve got to bag up everything individually, have everything ready, keep it hot or cold as the case may be, outside of the kitchen.”

In the Jackson Public School District, meals were served at 12 sites across the city on Mondays and Wednesdays during the school year. Initially the district was serving Monday through Friday, but department officials decided it was best to stick to two days for the safety of everyone involved.

“Of course maintaining safety is always a concern,” said Marc Rowe, school nutrition director at the district. “It’s always a challenge to make sure that we’re all practicing social distancing and wearing all of our protective equipment.”

JPS is using a drive-up method, where parents pull up to the sites and workers hand them the bagged meals — two on Mondays and three on Wednesdays, so families have food for the week but don’t have to come by daily.

The state’s second largest school district typically serves about 19,000 lunches and 10,000 breakfasts a day during the school year.

“We know that because of those numbers, there is a major need for students to eat breakfast and lunch even though they’re not in a traditional school setting,” Rowe said.

Since mid-March when the governor closed schools to mid-May, Rowe said the district served roughly 125,000 meals. The district returned to Monday through Friday service on June 1 until June 10 for its summer feeding program.

The Coahoma County School District, which serves almost 1,200 students, delivered 1,200 breakfast and 1,200 lunches every day on Monday through Friday. The district ended their delivery meal services two weeks ago to prepare for their summer feeding program on June 1.

Maintaining employee safety is a challenge for all districts, but for some, trying to reach as many students as possible has been the biggest barrier of all.

Wilma McIntosh, food service director in the Clarksdale Municipal School District, said the stigma of the virus and rural areas the district serves are making it difficult to reach as many students.

“Even though the advertisement is out there and we’re encouraging everyone to come, some still don’t come. They may not have transportation and some they just may be fearful with coming out,” McIntosh said.

Clarksdale Municipal schools, Coahoma’s neighboring district, served grab-and-go meals — including breakfast and lunch — for five days a week. Across three sites, over 500 students received meals daily, McIntosh said.

But, this doesn’t equate to nearly half of the 3,000 students in the district. The district usually serves 525,000 meals per year.

As a way to reach more kids, the district implemented “Wildcat on Wheels,” bussing meals to students across the town. This one-day operation ended quickly for fear of the “safety for the community and employees,” McIntosh said.

Unlike schools, the issue for the Olive Branch Food Pantry, comprising more than 20 churches and organizations, wasn’t transportation. Michele McCrory, director, said their initial issue was finding volunteers. Their usual volunteers consisted of older people. Despite social distancing measures, they felt unsafe being around others, she said. As a result, the pantry closed in April.

“It was a hard decision for us. Many pantries opened during the COVID-19 scare. We have a couple of board members who are older or take care of elderly people, so they couldn’t get around people,” McCrory said.

The pantry secured younger volunteers and reopened in May operating as a drive through. They serve about 60 boxes every week to families.

In addition to food pantries, nonprofits and community organizations helped carry the load by giving monetary relief and helping hands for meal distribution.

In Tallahatchie County, The Tutwiler Community Education Center stepped in when the local school district couldn’t provide meals. Before the coronavirus, the organization’s role has always been to support the community in times of need.

“When the storm hit (earlier this year) and people lights were out and lost food, we were able to get a donation to get 10,000 gift cards for food to support that need and fortunately, we were able to partner with organizations,” Melanie Powell, executive director of the center, said.

This time is no different except for the increasing demand of food, she said. They are now doling out more than 250 food boxes per week. At this rate, Powell says the center “will be a food bank.”

Through it’s FEED fund, the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi received over $150,000 to provide meals and food boxes to food pantries, church and community organizations, and food pantries. The Maddox Foundation of Hernando and the Walton Family Foundation gave over $100,000 to assist the foundation in its efforts.

While the pandemic has undoubtedly hindered people’s ability to access basic sustenance, it doesn’t mean that it has inflamed an overwhelming sense of despair in all.

“I don’t want to keep portraying our community like we don’t still have people who have pride in this place just because of something like this,” Fountain said. “People are resilient. They find ways to bounce back. Even in this time of confusion, I encounter people who have smiles on their faces, who are happy about life. They’re grateful to be here, even in the midst of all this stuff that’s going on.”","‘The most nutritious meal they’ll get’: How Mississippi districts are feeding kids in a pandemicJune 10, 2020When schools first closed because of the pandemic, the most pressing issue for many districts wasn’t figuring out how to continue education.

39,39,"Dec 4, 2019",The New York Times,Hundreds of Thousands Are Losing Access to Food Stamps,"Under the rule, effective April 1, 2020, an area eligible for a waiver would have to have a 24-month average unemployment rate that is not only 20 percent above the national average but also at least 6 percent.

Anti-poverty groups said the administration’s focus on the unemployment rate was misleading.

“The overall unemployment rate is really a measure of the whole labor market and not people without a high school diploma who are incredibly poor and may lack transportation,” said Stacy Dean, the vice president for food assistance policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We’re talking about a different group who just face a very different labor market.”

The rule is the first of three Agriculture Department efforts to scale back the food stamp program, and so far, Trump administration officials appear unmoved by the protests flooding in. More than 140,000 public comments were submitted on the rule that was made final on Wednesday, and they were overwhelmingly negative.

“The Trump administration is driving the vulnerable into hunger just as the Christmas season approaches,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday. “It is heartless. It is cruel. It exposes a deep and shameful cruelness and hypocrisy in this administration.”

The department has also proposed a rule that would close what it calls a loophole that allows people with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four — to receive food stamps. The rule would also prevent households with more than $2,250 in assets, or $3,500 for a household with a disabled adult, from receiving food stamps. Those changes would strip nearly three million people of their benefits, the department said, and nearly one million children would lose automatic eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals. The proposal received 75,000 public comments, which were overwhelmingly negative.","Under the rule, effective April 1, 2020, an area eligible for a waiver would have to have a 24-month average unemployment rate that is not only 20 percent above the national average but also at least 6 percent.

41,41,"Jun 26, 2020",The Hechinger Report,Teen Health Mississippi tries to help youth survive during coronavirus,"When Teen Health Mississippi launched an emergency relief fund to assist young Mississippians ages 13 to 19 struggling to get enough to eat or find somewhere safe to stay during the pandemic, staff members predicted 500 applications, tops. They received more than 4,000.

Youth from each of Mississippi’s 82 counties applied for emergency aid from the nonprofit, which advocates for high-quality and evidence-based sex education and improved healthcare for teens in the state.

The pleas for help were often desperate. “I barely can eat, and I am tired of not having a stable place to live. I’m stressed,” wrote one applicant. “People are trying to pressure me into doing things I know are wrong, and that will only get me in trouble.”

Two-thirds of the roughly 4,000 teens who applied for emergency relief through the nonprofit Teen Health Mississippi said they were experiencing food insecurity.

Justin Lofton, director of Youth Engagement and Advocacy for the group, said a large percentage of applicants said their parents hadn’t yet received unemployment benefits after losing their jobs as a result of coronavirus closures, increasing the financial strain on their families. Almost two-thirds of youth said they were experiencing food insecurity. Others said they were homeless. Some could no longer afford medicine needed to treat diabetes, a health condition that can complicate recovery from the coronavirus.

Lofton said the crisis is particularly acute for LGBTQ youth in the state, who were more likely to experience hardships such as homelessness even before the pandemic. “We see a lot of young people, regardless of where they come from, are fending for themselves,” he said.

Teen Health Mississippi director, Hope Crenshaw, argues that empowering young people to look out for their best interests starts with addressing trauma and making sure their basic needs are met. She worries that now, many teens seeking help will be forced into difficult and even dangerous situations. “Youth aren’t able to make the most healthy decisions when they don’t have access to safe schools, clothing and shelter,” she said.

Through its emergency relief initiative, Teen Health Mississippi has disbursed nearly $11,000 in direct aid to more than 150 youth across the state. The amount allocated to each recipient has varied based on need.

About 4,000 teens, representing each of Mississippi’s 82 counties, applied for emergency relief from the nonprofit Teen Health Mississippi. The organization had anticipated just 500 would apply.

For Marchellos Scott, a rising high school senior in the Mississippi Delta, the assistance has been a lifeline. “Where I’m from, it’s very hard for us to get things that we need,” he said listing off reliable transportation and meals as challenges he and his peers often face.

Scott is a member of the Mississippi Youth Council, another advocacy effort supported by Teen Health Mississippi.* Initially he thought he’d spend the spring lobbying the state legislature for changes to the state’s sex-ed curriculum, before heading to a special college program for high school seniors in the summer. Then the pandemic arrived, threatening to derail his plans to participate in the program that could help him prepare for college.

The 17-year-old lives with a guardian and considered taking on a part-time job to help make ends meet. But he worried working would hamper his ability to earn college credits over the summer and get a jumpstart on his higher education.

Scott received a scholarship from the University of Mississippi to participate in a selective public policy program in which 40 upcoming high school seniors will have the opportunity to stay on campus and travel to the District of Columbia. (The program has since transitioned to distance learning.) The financial help from Teen Health Mississippi means Scott will be able to participate in the program after all.

The nonprofit has also partnered with several youth-focused organizations across the state to help cover costs for other assistance, including rent stipends and baby supplies for young or expectant parents. A $75,000 grant from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s #startsmall initiative is sponsoring the effort.

Those dollars are already being used to support youth tribal members of Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, one of the groups hardest hit by coronavirus in the state. Teen Health Mississippi has also partnered with a local group to help deliver groceries to families trying to limit their trips outside the home and to establish spending accounts for youth at local stores.

Crenshaw and Lofton know many young people are thankful for the assistance, but they that without bigger, more systemic changes kids won’t be able to weather the pandemic and the resulting economic crisis long term.

“It can’t be this piecemeal approach,” Crenshaw said.

42,42,"Dec 21, 2020",The Counter,Hunger and food insecurity are not the same. Here’s why that matters—and what they mean.,"For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

But that number actually represented the lowest rates of food insecurity in nearly a decade. The pandemic and resulting economic crisis have tragically reversed this trajectory, and the United States is now experiencing an exponential increase in both food insecurity and hunger.

In late October, Feeding America, the country’s largest hunger-relief organization, projected that 54 million Americans didn’t have enough food to eat—a 46 percent increase since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The data are even more painful for households with children, whose rates of food insecurity have more than tripled since the onset of the pandemic.

A snapshot assessment led by the U.S. Census Bureau and designed to offer less-comprehensive but more immediate information on the social and economic impacts of Covid, showed that, as recently as the period between November 25 and December 7 (including Thanksgiving), some 27 million adults—13 percent of all adults in the country—reported their household sometimes or often didn’t have enough to eat.","For some period of time in 2019, nearly 14 million American households “had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.” That’s how it was officially documented: a grievous statistic for the world’s richest country, where 30 to 40 percent of our food is discarded annually.

43,43,"Jan 11, 2021",The Conversation US,18 million US children are at risk of hunger: How is the problem being addressed and what more can be done?,"Editor’s note: The economic crisis brought about by the coronavirus pandemic has increased the number of Americans who can’t always get enough to eat, including children. The Conversation U.S. asked four experts to explain how common child hunger is and what’s being done to address it.

1. How big a problem is child hunger in the US?

Heather Eicher-Miller, associate professor of nutrition science at Purdue University: Hunger has two very different meanings. It can describe that uncomfortable feeling you get after not eating in a while. It’s also a long-term physical state.

People who experience long-term hunger aren’t just uncomfortable. They can feel weakness or pain and run an elevated risk of illnesses, including asthma, iron-deficiency anemia and poor bone health.

Hunger can of course arise when someone doesn’t eat enough, but it’s also a result of food insecurity – what happens when you lack the money or other means of accessing enough of the right kinds or amounts of food.

Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

David Himmelgreen, professor of anthropology at the University of South Florida: Food insecurity and child hunger have both skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were an estimated 50 million food-insecure Americans by the end of 2020, up sharply from 35 million in 2019, the last year for which official data is available.

Feeding America, the nation’s largest anti-hunger organization, estimated in 2019 that there were 12.5 million U.S. children – 1 in 6 – at risk of hunger. With growth in the number of American workers unemployed and children living in poverty, a team of researchers determined in July 2020 that 18 million children – 1 in 4 – were experiencing food insecurity at least sometimes, a few months into the coronavirus pandemic.

Kecia Johnson, assistant professor of sociology at Mississippi State University: Children who experience hunger are more likely to be sick, to recuperate from illness more slowly and to be hospitalized more frequently.

Among other things, being food insecure increases the potential for obesity, heart disease and diabetes, including for children. And food-insecure children are at least twice as likely as other kids to have a variety of health problems, such as anemia, asthma and anxiety.

Food-insecure kids can also have more trouble at school than other children and become more likely to experience social isolation.

2. What’s being done about the problem?

Diana Cuy Castellanos, assistant professor of dietetics and nutrition at the University of Dayton: Some 15 federal programs assist Americans who need help getting enough nutritious food to eat. The programs cover different populations including the elderly, people with low incomes, infants and children, and Native American communities, as well as areas where there is need for emergency relief due to disasters.

The largest is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known more commonly as SNAP. It provides assistance for the purchase of food based on income and cost US$85.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Following the passage of a bipartisan relief package in December, most families of four can currently get $782 in monthly assistance through SNAP.

Many people still call these benefits “food stamps,” but now, instead of receiving vouchers to purchase food, people receive a card that looks like a credit card with their food allowance on it.

The government also runs the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides nutritional aid for low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women and women with at least one child age 5 or under. In addition, there are the School Breakfast and Lunch programs as well as the Summer Food Service Program, which funds free healthy meals and snacks to children and teens in low-income areas when school is not in session.

Many of these programs target specific segments of the population, such as children and the elderly. All have something in common: They are designed to help low-income families afford food so as to free up more of their limited income on other needs, such as housing and transportation.

Himmelgreen: While federal nutrition programs have helped reduce the severity of food insecurity and child hunger, only a limited number of Americans who don’t get enough to eat can take advantage of them. To get SNAP in Florida, for example, people may not have more than a total of either $2,001 or $3,001 – depending on their age and disabilities – in their savings and checking accounts. Other states have similar but different restrictions, making it hard to estimate the number of Americans who need help but can’t get it. Hence, millions more people than ever are relying on drive-through food pantries during the pandemic.

Johnson: There are some 60,000 food pantries, meal programs and food banks, according to Feeding America, serving about 40 million people yearly. Feeding America and its affiliated food banks and pantries also run food pantries in schools and backpack programs, which provide students with easily prepared foods, like boxed macaroni and cheese and canned beans, to take home, throughout the country.

For example, an elementary school in Holmes County, Mississippi, has supplied participating families with food and other supplies since 2019.

Eicher-Miller: Nutrition education is another way to address food insecurity and help reduce the number of children who go hungry. For example, the federal government offers nutrition education to individuals and families who receive SNAP benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education program, or SNAP-Ed. It provides comprehensive nutrition education regarding how to get the most nutrition per food dollar to many of the people who get SNAP benefits and may be having trouble serving their families healthy meals on a limited budget.

The government supports SNAP-Ed in locations like food pantries, community centers and food assistance offices. Its practical budgeting advice, cooking classes and nutrition information make families with children less likely to experience food insecurity, according to a study by my team. When people get the hang of buying the healthiest foods they can on a tight budget, their kids are less likely to go hungry.

I think of nutrition education as a gift that keeps giving in the sense that once someone has the knowledge they can keep using it to stay food secure into the future.

3. What are some of the more promising innovations?

Cuy Castellanos: Food insecurity is a complex problem for many reasons, including the limited access millions of people have to the fresh fruits and vegetables everyone should eat.

That’s why I’m excited to see people starting to grow their own food in low-income communities with few grocery stores or opportunities to buy produce, from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Nonprofits and families are growing food on their own property or are using vacant lots or land on school or church grounds.

Some groups such as Homefull and Mission of Mary Farms in Dayton, Ohio, have even begun to build greenhouses to extend the growing season and producing root vegetables and leafy greens as well as raising chickens.

Johnson: A new community garden is also making a difference in the small majority-Black town of Maben in rural Mississippi, where there’s nowhere to buy vegetables. Starting in 2019, local leaders approved the conversion of a former school athletic field into a community garden. Once volunteers from a farmers cooperative had cleared and plowed the field, other volunteers planted and harvested crops of tomatoes, purple hull peas, okra and watermelons. The gardeners distributed this first wave of produce primarily to elderly people in Maben who used to have family gardens and give away their own homegrown food in years past.

Himmelgreen: Many innovative programs across the country are aiming to reduce food insecurity and improve the health of low-income Americans.

At “client food choice” food pantries, clients don’t just pick up boxes of free, nutritious items. Instead, they get to choose the foods they want and get recipes and other kinds of nutrition education. There are also food prescription programs based in hospitals and medical clinics, where patients are screened for food insecurity and, if eligible, enrolled in SNAP and given help connecting with food pantries either on site or nearby.

A growing number of nonprofits also refer people to school-based food pantries, which operate in K-12 public schools and on college campuses and the meals-on-wheels programs that assist people who are homebound.

I believe these programs need to be scaled up or replicated whenever possible in areas where there is a high level of food insecurity and child hunger but a lack of nonprofit help available.","Whereas hunger is a physical condition, food insecurity is an economic and social situation.

“I know not everybody can donate a million dollars, but I feel like this is the central place to [donate to] if you really want to do something,” Winfrey says during their virtual interview. “I know I can trust my money in your hands.”

A stunned Andrés — who could barely believe he was speaking with Winfrey! — immediately expressed his gratitude. “We are so honored to be in your presence giving this fund this kind of visibility,” he says. “We are going to come out of this crisis stronger than ever, making sure we don’t leave anybody behind.”

America’s Food Fund was launched with $12 million on Thursday by Leonardo DiCaprio, Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple to aid World Central Kitchen and Feeding America.

According to a press release, “America’s Food Fund will address the issue of food access in the United States and will provide funding relief to both organizations in furthering their missions to feed the country’s most vulnerable populations impacted by COVID-19, including children who rely on school lunch programs, low-income families, the elderly, and individuals facing job disruptions.”

Andrés was one of the first to launch relief efforts amid the coronavirus outbreak, when he began serving food to thousands of passengers and crew members on board the quarantined Grand Princess cruise ship in early March. World Central Kitchen supported nearly 2,500 passengers and over 1,000 crew members who spent several days stuck on the ship.

45,45,"Sep 9, 2020",Wiley,Measuring Food Insecurity during the COVID‐19 Pandemic of Spring 2020,"This projected rise in food insecurity was based on historical relationships between the unemployment rates and official federal government numbers on food insecurity (for detailed information on measuring food insecurity and its relationship with economic conditions see Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011 and Gundersen and Ziliak 2018 ). Would this relationship hold during the pandemic? Or would the state and governmental measures to mitigate the damages of the pandemic, accompanied by greater efforts in the food charity system, keep food insecurity in check? To answer this question, we conducted an internet survey on May 13–14, 2020 measuring food security following the methods in Ahn, Smith, and Norwood ( 2020 ). It is referred to as the ASN survey.

As employees were furloughed or laid off, businesses saw their sales plummet in the spring of 2020 due to COVID‐19, and some food prices rose, it was evident that many people would be in financial straits. Concerns arose that an unprecedented number of Americans would have trouble obtaining their food needs. On April 19, 2020 a representative of Feeding America remarked that requests for food assistance at food pantries were expected to rise by almost 50% and that they had spent more money on food in the past month than the previous six months combined (CBS 2020 ). The unemployment rate for April 2020 was 14.7%, up from 4.4% in the previous month (USBLS 2020 ), and Feeding America (with help from agricultural economists) projected on April 22 that such a rise in unemployment should be associated with a 5% increase in the food insecurity rate (Feeding America 2020 ).

The ASN Survey in May 13–14, 2020

The ASN survey entails using a nonrepresentative opt‐in sample where individuals are administered the food security questionnaire used by the USDA in its official food security estimates. While the USDA survey represents the gold standard in food security estimates due to its use of expensive probability sampling, it is only administered once a year, in December. If rapid, timely food security estimates are desired then less representative samples like the ASN survey is required. Internet surveys using opt‐in panels are not the ideal method for measuring the impact of COVID‐19 on food insecurity. They may appear representative in terms of a few demographics but because they are not true probability samples, they are unrepresentative in terms of other demographics. Our previous research has shown these samples can differ greatly from the US population in terms of variables like unemployment, for example.

Even when careful sample balancing is used and procedures are set in place to mimic the screening procedures employed by the USDA (where some households are automatically deemed to be food secure and are not administered the food security questionnaire), food insecurity rates can be 9%–14% higher than those estimated by the USDA. However, our research also demonstrates that results from internet surveys can be calibrated to mimic closely the USDA statistics. By using a more stringent screening process than that used by the USDA one can obtain insecurity numbers that closely resemble the USDA numbers for 2016 and 2017. The two years of prior experience with the ASN survey, however, suggests that it will still overpredict the percentage of food insecure households by 2%–3% (Ahn, Smith, and Norwood 2020).

Our survey differs from the ASN survey given in 2016 and 2017 in only one regard: how household income is elicited. The household income question typically asks respondents' total household pretax income, but during COVID‐19, many households may feel they are unsure exactly what their income will be. As such, we ask two income questions. The first asks their actual income in 2019 and the second asks their expected income for 2020. An additional question also asks if the size of their household has changed between 2019 and 2020 to help isolate income changes caused by changes in household composition.

The sample was acquired from the Qualtrics company, who selected a sample of respondents from its opt‐in panel that is similar to the demographic profile of the US in terms of age, income, gender, education, and race. These individuals are recruited using a variety of methods, including internet recruitment and referrals. Compensation for taking surveys is performed through airline miles, cash, gift cards, and the like, and third‐party validation is used to confirm the participants' contact information. The survey was administered on the Qualtrics software platform during the period May 13–14, 2020.

Each household was administered ten to eighteen questions (depending on whether they have children) to evaluate their food security status. This is the identical questionnaire used by the USDA in its official food insecurity estimates (ERS 2012). We follow the same protocol as Ahn, Smith, and Norwood (2020) for translating the ten to eighteen responses for each household into to one of four food security status groups: high food security, marginal food security, low food security, and very low food security. A household is then considered food insecure if the status is low or very low. Details on the questions and this protocol are discussed fully in Ahn, Smith, and Norwood (2020).

The USDA survey employees a protocol by which households are given a preliminary food security question, and if they indicate no food insecurity in this question and indicate a household income above 185% of the poverty line then they are assumed to be food secure and are not administered the food security questionnaire. This is referred to as “screening” and is done to limit respondent fatigue, as the USDA contains many questions in addition to food security (it is conducted in addition to the Current Population Survey), but since our internet survey contains far fewer questions we ask both the preliminary question and the food security questions of all respondents. Our previous research showed that if you employ sample balancing to reconcile demographic differences between the sample and the population, and if the screening procedure is simulated the internet survey will overestimate food insecurity by 9–14%. However, if the screening procedure is replaced with a calibration that simply assumes all households above 185% of the poverty line are food secure, the internet survey closely mimics the USDA numbers, so that is the procedure we employ. This survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oklahoma State University: application number IRB‐20‐245.

We previously administered the identical food security questionnaires in 2016 and 2017, allowing us to compare May 2020 rates to those in recent years where economic conditions were more normal. Table 1 shows the demographic profile of the respondents in the May 2020 survey compared to our similar surveys in December of 2016 and 2017 (Ahn, Smith, and Norwood 2020). A number of demographics are consistent across surveys, like income and gender. Other demographics have some variations, like household size, region, and education. Demographics like the percentage of households with an unemployed member can differ considerably. While sample balancing can be used to correct for these demographic differences, it is an imperfect correction. A main difference is that unemployment is not a variable used in sample balancing for May 2020 because as of May the percent of households with an unemployed member was unknown.

The respondents reported being affected by COVID‐19. One survey question asked how their financial status had changed since March 2020 due to the pandemic. Four responses were available (no change in household income, lost job, lower household income, higher household income) and respondents could select multiple options. While 50% reported no change in their financial status, 19% indicated that one or more household members lost their job and 33% said their household would make less money. When comparing households' expected 2020 income to their 2019 income, on average households expect to make about $3,000 less this year than the previous year. Also, when asked whether any household member experienced symptoms resembling Covid‐19, 11% said “yes”, 2% said “maybe,” and 87% said “no.” Of those who said “yes” or “maybe,” 37% were not tested, 42% tested positive, and 21% tested negative.","This projected rise in food insecurity was based on historical relationships between the unemployment rates and official federal government numbers on food insecurity (for detailed information on measuring food insecurity and its relationship with economic conditions see Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011 and Gundersen and Ziliak 2018 ).

The figure represents almost five times the reported food instability percentage reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture prior to the pandemic. Adults in households with children were many times more likely to report lack of sufficient food. Per population, Mississippi is the most affected state in the United States. With the exception of the District of Columbia, Mississippi suffers the highest rate of nourishment insecure children...by far.

""In the richest country in the world, it's disgraceful that any child goes hungry."", Constantin Poinexter, CEO

On the 26th of January, Surety One, Inc. delivered a monetary gift to the Mississippi Food Network to combat hunger and food insecurity affecting Mississippi families. Pursuant to Surety One, Inc.'s agreement with the Poindexter Surety charitable alliance, chief executive officer Constantin Poindexter doubled the corporate donation with his personal funds. In effort to draw attention to the current suffering of local families, Poindexter contacted the chief executives of Mississippi's ten largest privately held businesses and urged them to consider doing the same.

Said Poindexter, ""It's unbelievable that in the most prosperous nation in the world that we have hungry kids. Nearly 75% of Mississippi children are eligible for free or reduced cost lunches which many can't obtain as a result of COVID-related school closures. Other than terminal illnesses it's hard to imagine many things more heartbreaking that kids going to bed hungry. It really is disgraceful. This food insecurity thing is going to be a pet project of our charitable work going forward.""

Operating since 1984, the Mississippi Food Network distributes over 1.5. million pounds of food per month. It is one of the most efficient charitable delivery vehicles of its kind, boasting a delivery of ninety-five cents of each dollar donated, to food programs.

As a member of the communities that it serves, Surety One, Inc. contributes to the relief of the sick, disabled, and less fortunate members of society. Surety One, Inc. is a supporter of the No Kid Hungry Foundation and the Feeding America initiative, and urges everyone to consider a donation to the cause of defeating food insecurity.

Under deals with contractors, universities have hiked meal plan prices significantly in recent years, adding to rising cost of college.

Students eat lunch at Perry Cafeteria at Mississippi State Tuesday, October 9, 2019. (Photo: Eric J. Shelton / Mississippi Today)

Editor's note: The Southern Foodways Alliance has collaborated with the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger, AL.com and Mississippi Today to shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi.

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food.Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an ""unlimited"" meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal ""swipes"" didn't roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).""

Glasper isn't alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country, and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor, Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

""Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,"" said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

Story continues below gallery.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State's operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

RELATED: Real food challenge: Auburn University, unlike peers, requires 20% local source of dining food

But contractors eventually ran out of ""ways to distinguish themselves on the service side"" when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

""Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it,"" he said.

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12 percent commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn't reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a ""campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan ""is much, much more expensive"" than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won't use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,"" Mac Dermott said of meal options. ""They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a ""food-court environment"" where managers can ""interchange menu concepts very easily,"" said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.""

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into a “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

""Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,"" said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. ""They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they're going to have access to (at home).""

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but ""we've adjusted"" to student demand. ""Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there's going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the ""Ultimate"" plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren't using the rising prices to ""pad the pocket of the institution."" She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshmen are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 ""Rebel Unlimited Plus 1"" plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract ""to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,"" said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar ""Dining Dollars"" food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama's contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid such as Pell Grants doesn't always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better about using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,"" Grant said. ""But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefits package, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there,"" he said. Eventually, it was ""ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.”

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,"" Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017.

""I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,"" he said. ""We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

About this story

For 2019, the Southern Foodways Alliance (SFA), an institute of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, has explored the labor of food through symposia, films, podcasts, and other media. The SFA collaborated with AL.com, the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion-Ledger, and Mississippi Today to produce three interlocked stories, Food Is Work. Together, they shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi — the largest public universities in Alabama and Mississippi.

50,50,"Jun 3, 2020",PRNewswire,Study Shows State And Local Food Insecurity Reached Lowest Levels Since Its Inception 10 Years Ago,"CHICAGO, June 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- After nearly ten years, food insecurity levels for most communities across the country had reached their lowest levels in 2018, according to a study released by Feeding America. Map the Meal Gap, released today by Feeding America, is the only study that provides local-level estimates of food insecurity across the United States. Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization, has released the report for ten consecutive years to offer insights on how food insecurity and food costs vary at the local level.

In conjunction with the Map the Meal Gap study, which uses the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Census Bureau, Feeding America has released an interactive map based on its recently released study, The Impact of the Coronavirus on Local Food Insecurity, which used the Map the Meal Gap model to predict changes to food insecurity rates for the overall population and children in response to projected changes to poverty and unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus (COVD-19) pandemic. That analysis shows that progress made to food insecurity in the U.S. this past decade will likely be wiped out and food insecurity rates will climb higher than the peak of the Great Recession of 50 million people, potentially going from more than 37 million people facing hunger in 2018 up to more than 54 million in 2020.

""Map the Meal Gap shows once again that not one single county in this country is free from hunger,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, chief executive officer of Feeding America. ""In the decade before the pandemic, we made progress in finally returning to pre-Great Recession levels of food insecurity, though that number was still regrettably high. That fragile progress has given way under the weight of this crisis. The Feeding America network of food banks knows all too well the precarious nature of household budgets. We also know that the work that we do has great potential to help and we cannot make meaningful progress alone. Our vision is an America where no one is hungry. Join us in making that mission a reality for the tens of millions of people out there who need us now more than ever.""

Per Map the Meal Gap 2020, all 3,142 counties and county equivalents as well as 436 congressional districts in all 50 states are home to people who struggle with hunger. The percentage of the population estimated to be food insecure in 2018 ranges from a low of 3.6% of the population in Burke County, North Dakota up to 30.4% in Jefferson County, Mississippi. Child food insecurity rates range from 2.4% in Falls Church City, Virginia to 43.7% in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana.

According to the COVID-19 impact analysis, the food insecurity rates for all counties across the country will likely see increases. For example, Jefferson County, Mississippi, the county with the highest overall food insecurity rate is projected to increase from 30.4% to 34.2% this year. Burke County, North Dakota, which had the lowest overall food insecurity rate in 2018, is projected to see a food insecurity rate (9.2%) more than 2.5 times its most recent rate (3.6%). In East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, more than half the child population is projected to be food insecure, with the rate going from 43.7% to 52.5% because of the pandemic.

While food insecurity affects every community, people of color and African Americans, in particular, are disproportionately impacted as a result of structural disparities. In 2018, food insecurity among African American households was more than twice that of white, non-Hispanic households according to the USDA. Structural and institutional racism have positioned communities of color as particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout and health consequences of this pandemic. Systemic barriers to jobs less likely to be affected by the pandemic, lower than average wages, and greater employment instability all contribute to African American workers being more at risk of experiencing food insecurity. Both pre-pandemic and in 2020, counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are overrepresented by counties with a majority African American population. For example, in Jefferson County, Mississippi, which has the highest food insecurity rate in 2018 and highest projected rate in 2020, 86% of the population is African American.

These Feeding America studies underscore the extent of need that remains in communities across the United States. Food insecurity is a measure defined by the USDA as lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members.

Other key findings of Map the Meal Gap 2020 include:

One-third of people who are food insecure may not qualify for federal food assistance. Virtually every county (97%) is home to people who are food insecure and likely ineligible for such assistance, and there are 115 counties in which a majority of people estimated to be food insecure is unlikely to qualify.

Counties with the highest rates of food insecurity are disproportionately rural. Rural counties – those outside of major metropolitan areas – make up 63% of all U.S counties, but 87% of counties with food insecurity rates in the top 10%.

An estimated 84% of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity – those that rank in the top 10% of all 3,142 counties – are in the South. Since the South contains 45% of all U.S. counties, this region is home to a disproportionately high number of counties with the highest rates of food insecurity.

""Hunger in America must become unacceptable for all of us,"" Babineaux-Fontenot continued. ""There were 37 million people facing hunger before the pandemic, but most people had no idea. If there is any 'silver lining' to the dark cloud of this pandemic, it is that the American public is far better informed about the food crisis that has accompanied the health one. We know it will take an entire network of support, including food banks, partner agencies like food pantries, federal nutrition programs, the food industry, and the public to make the progress that is so desperately needed.""

Map the Meal Gap 2020 uses data from USDA, the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and food price data and analysis provided by Nielsen, a global measurement and data analytics company. The study is supported by Conagra Brands Foundation and Nielsen.

""Conagra Brands Foundation is proud to partner with Feeding America and food banks across the country to help provide food to children, teenagers, adults and senior citizens. Helping to increase awareness of this critical issue, which affects every community in America, has never been more important,"" said Robert J. Rizzo, Senior Director, Community Investment, Conagra Brands and Conagra Brands Foundation.

In addition to food-insecurity estimates, Map the Meal Gap reports on food price variation across counties. Using data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS), the study finds that, on average, food-secure individuals report spending $3.09 per person, per meal as of 2018. This is essentially the same as the national average of $3.02 ($3.09 in 2018 dollars) as reported in Map the Meal Gap last year.

After adjusting the national average meal cost of $3.09 based on local sales taxes and Nielsen data on relative food prices, Map the Meal Gap 2020 finds that county meal costs range from 69% of the national average in places like Llano County, Texas ($2.14) to more than double the average cost in places like New York County, New York ($6.19).

""Nielsen is proud to continue our decade long data and analytics partnership to Map the Meal Gap. Eliminating hunger is especially urgent with so many vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said David Rawlinson, CEO, Nielsen Global Connect.

Dr. Craig Gundersen, Professor of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois, Executive Director of the National Soybean Research Laboratory and a member of Feeding America's Technical Advisory Group is the lead researcher of Map the Meal Gap 2020 and the food insecurity projection analysis.

Map the Meal Gap 2020 provides the following data online through an interactive map:

The estimated percentage of the population and number of individuals who are food insecure in every U.S. state, county and congressional district, as well as the service area of each Feeding America food bank.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely qualifies for SNAP and other federal nutrition programs.

The percentage of the food-insecure population who likely does not qualify for federal nutrition programs and thus must rely even more on charitable food assistance. These percentages reflect individuals in households with earnings that are higher than the state gross income limits for federal nutrition programs.

The average meal cost in every state and county.

The food budget shortfall in every state and county.

The Map the Meal Gap 2020 map allows policymakers, state agencies, corporate partners, food banks and advocates to develop integrated strategies to fight hunger on a community level.

Separately, a new interactive map shows the 2020 food insecurity projections compared to the most recent Map the Meal Gap data. To account for local unemployment variation, this new analysis adjusts the national annual unemployment projection due to COVID-19 using projected changes in the unemployment rate by industry and occupation from Goldman Sachs Investment Research and actual percentages of workers by industry from the American Community Survey.

Along with the interactive map and visualizations, Feeding America has also published a series of report briefs, including a summary of key findings as well as analyses on child food insecurity, food price variation and health, disability and food insecurity.

Federal nutrition assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), serve as the first line of defense against hunger. However, not everyone who is food insecure qualifies for these federal programs. As of 2018, one in three (32%) food-insecure individuals who reported income lived in households unlikely to qualify for most federal food assistance. These findings underscore the importance of protecting and strengthening the existing safety net of public food assistance while also investing in the charitable programs that help to fill the gap for people who are not eligible.

52,52,"Jul 10, 2020",Oxfam America,"12,000 people could die each day from hunger linked to COVID-19","The briefing reveals the world’s 10 worst hunger hotspots, places such as Venezuela and South Sudan where the food crisis is most severe and getting worse as a result of the pandemic. It also highlights emerging epicenters of hunger – middle income countries such as India, South Africa, and Brazil – where millions of people who were barely managing have been tipped over the edge by the pandemic.

“COVID-19 is causing us a lot of harm. Giving my children something to eat in the morning has become difficult,” said Kadidia Diallo, a female milk producer in Burkina Faso. “We are totally dependent on the sale of milk, and with the closure of the market we can’t sell the milk anymore. If we don’t sell milk, we don't eat.”

‘ The Hunger Virus ,’ warns that 121 million more people could be pushed to the brink of starvation this year as a result of the social and economic fallout from the pandemic, including through mass unemployment, disruption to food production and supplies, and declining aid.

A new Oxfam briefing warns that as many as 12,000 people could die per day by the end of the year as a result of hunger linked to COVID-19, potentially more than could die from the disease.

“COVID-19 is the last straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflict, climate change, inequality and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers,” said Oxfam America President Abby Maxman.

In Brazil, for instance, millions of poor workers, with little in the way of savings or benefits to fall back on, lost their incomes as a result of lockdown. Only 10 percent of the financial support promised by the federal government had been distributed by late June with big business favored over workers and smaller more vulnerable companies.

In India, travel restrictions left farmers without vital migrant labor at the peak of the harvest season, forcing many to leave their crops in the field to rot. Traders have also been unable to reach tribal communities during the peak harvest season for forest products, depriving up to 100 million people of their main source of income for the year.

The United States is not immune to this hunger crisis. The pandemic obliterated systems that had, for years, kept millions one small step away from poverty and food insecurity. Countless businesses shuttered, leaving millions unemployed and struggling to pay bills. Schools closed, removing reliable sources of breakfast and lunch for millions of students. The food chain faltered—from produce fields to meat plants--causing prices to rise. It’s estimated that food insecurity rates in the United States have doubled.

“The awful truth is that food insecurity is exploding here in our own backyard,” said Maxman. “Every town has people who are going to bed hungry right now. Those who were on the edge before are now struggling to stay afloat. In Mississippi, nearly a quarter of all residents are experiencing food insecurity; in Louisiana, over a third of all children are facing empty cupboards.”

In every region in the world, women, and women-headed households, are more likely to go hungry. Women are already vulnerable because of systemic discrimination that sees them earn less and own fewer assets than men. They make up a large proportion of groups, such as informal workers, that have been hit hard by the economic fallout of the pandemic, and have also borne the brunt of a dramatic increase in unpaid care work as a result of school closures and family illness.

“Governments can save lives now by fully funding the UN’s COVID-19 appeal, making sure aid gets to those who need it most, and cancelling the debts of developing countries to free up funding for social protection and healthcare. To end this hunger crisis, governments must also build fairer, more robust, and more sustainable food systems, that put the interests of food producers and workers before the profits of big food and agribusiness,” said Eric Muñoz, Senior Manager Food and Climate Justice, Oxfam America.

Since the pandemic began, Oxfam has reached 4.5 million of the world’s most vulnerable people with food aid and clean water, working together with over 344 partners in over 60 countries. We aim to reach a total of 14 million people by raising a further $113 million to support our programs.

In the United States, Oxfam is advocating for the government to take steps to help the most vulnerable make ends meet during the pandemic. Right now, the US Senate has an opportunity to fight this hunger crisis at home and globally. Please join us in asking your Senator to ensure urgent funding to support people facing hunger in the US and around the world is included in the next #COVID19 relief bill.","“We are totally dependent on the sale of milk, and with the closure of the market we can’t sell the milk anymore.

53,53,"Nov 30, 2018",Ole Miss News,Office of Food and Nutrition Security Opens at South Oxford Center,"by

OXFORD, Miss. – The School of Applied Sciences at the University of Mississippi has opened a new Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the South Oxford Center.

Although David H. Holben, professor of nutrition and hospitality management, has been producing food security research at UM since he arrived in 2015, he and his students finally have devoted space to analyze data, conduct focus groups and interviews, and engage with community members.

“My vision for the Office of Food and Nutrition Security at the University of Mississippi is to be the recognized leader in providing innovative solutions for food insecurity in Mississippi, the United States and the world,” said Holben, who has been studying the problem since 1997.

“I’m hoping that we can have a global impact. I think (establishing a formal office) just reinforces the support that the university and the school have for this issue of food insecurity.”

Food insecurity is a lack of regular access to enough food to maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. According to the USDA’s 2017 estimates, some 15 million American households were food insecure.

More than 13 percent of rural households reported food insecurity, much higher than those in metropolitan areas. Between 2015 and 2017, food insecurity in Mississippi was among the highest in the nation, at 17.2 percent.

The university community is committed to helping solve this problem through its Flagship Constellations initiative, which seeks to find meaningful solutions through multidisciplinary response to health and social issues affecting Mississippi communities, the nation and the world. One of those constellations is Community Wellbeing, which works to find solutions to the challenges affecting rural communities to build stronger and more vibrant communities.

Holben brings food security expertise and research from the Office of Food and Nutrition Security to this collaboration.

Students and staff conducting research through the Office of Food and Nutrition Security have presented their findings at international conferences, including discussions of seven studies at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ annual conference in October.

Doctoral student Prabhdeep Sandha, of Jalandhar City, India, earned the Mead Johnson Nutrition/Research Dietetic Practice Group Student Research Award at the conference for her study, “Impact of a Produce Intervention on Parental Produce Intake and Behaviors,” co-authored by fellow graduate student Michelle Weber, of Cincinnati.

“Our (office) is continuously working to make a difference in Mississippi through fresh produce and healthy food interventions, community engagement and community education,” Sandha said. “With our previous projects, we were able to see some great results, which I hope will be evident in our future projects.”

Undergraduate students also are gaining research skills through the new office. Katelyn Tarr, a junior dietetics and nutrition major from Pawnee, Illinois, presented a study on “Food insecurity and type 2 diabetes risk of adults with school children” at the conference, with funding from the first Undergraduate Travel Grant awarded by the UM Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.

“Dr. Holben brought me in to learn how to write an abstract and make a poster for a conference, which is something that graduate students would normally do,” Tarr said. “It really helped me prepare for my post-graduate career.

“I was excited to work on nutrition research, but it turns out this really hits close to home for me. I’m from an area that has high food insecurity, so it was awesome to be a part of that.”

Five of the abstracts presented at conference stem from the Farm-to-YOUth! Project that Holben and his students have been working on since 2016, studying varying nutritional and educational interventions and their impact on food security in a rural Mississippi county.

From produce tastings and take-home produce for elementary school children to summer nutrition education and feeding programs at the public library, the faculty-student team has examined different ways to improve food security for people living in rural areas.

This fall, the office rolled out a new study in Calhoun County to examine food education interventions for high school athletes.

Holben, along with an external consultant, develops the twice-weekly programming that includes a lesson, snack and educational handouts. Graduate students Marta Dees, of Oxford, and Rebecca Henry, of The Plains, Virginia, teach the lessons and give each football player a take-home bag of fuel for the week, including peanut butter, yogurt, fresh fruit and granola bars, to implement the practices at home.

“We’re primarily hoping to change the food environment at home,” Holben said. “They’re learning eight to 10 basic principles about food and nutrition that we’re helping them to implement through take-home food packages.

“I think we can play a really key role in teaching basic sport nutrition principles to high schoolers, while keeping performance nutrition at the forefront of the coach’s mind. The hope is we can fill in the gap if they do have food insecurity in the home to help them to implement some performance nutrition principles since they’re athletes.”

Holben, lead author of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ most recent position paper on food insecurity in the United States, is elated with the opportunities that come with having an official office at the South Oxford Center. He looks forward to playing a significant role in fulfilling the university’s commitment to creating healthier, more vibrant communities.

Also included in the bill is a $9.5 billion emergency fund for producers of specialty crops and support for local food systems, including farmers’ markets. In addition, the bill directs $285 million to USDA agencies to support emergency operations during the pandemic.

March 25, 2020 update: The Senate and White House early on Wednesday reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion spending bill aimed at supporting businesses, workers, and individuals during the pandemic. The bill text is not yet public, but once it is made public, the House of Representatives will review and vote on the bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats earlier this week offered their own version of a stimulus / support package.

March 18, 2020 update: The Senate on Wednesday afternoon voted 90-8 to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, aimed at providing some support and benefits to people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

March 16, 2020 update: Early on Saturday, March 14, the House passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with strong bipartisan support, and with many of the provisions described in the original article below included.

The final text includes language that gives USDA the ability to waive various requirements that are preventing districts from feeding hungry children while schools are shuttered. As of March 15, at least 64,000 schools have closed, affecting more than 32.5 million students.

On SNAP, the final bill prevents eligibility restrictions during a public health emergency and gives states some flexibility to ask for emergency allotments, but does not directly increase benefits. It also provides an additional $500 million in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and an additional $250 million for food programs for low-income seniors, through September 2021.

The Senate is expected to take up the bill today. While some Republicans and President Trump have signaled support, its fate is still uncertain.

March 13, 2020, 3pm ET update:In a press conference at 2:00pm ET, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be “passing a bill” today. “Our bill takes aggressive action to strengthen food security initiatives including student meals as well as SNAP, senior meals, and food banks,” she said. However, Civil Eats has yet to see a final version of the legislative package, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. So it remains unclear which of the provisions on school meals and SNAP benefits (described below, as provisions of separate marker bills) will make it into the final legislation.

March 13, 2020, 11am ET update: As of early Friday, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to negotiate the package of legislation; a vote in the House of Representatives is expected today. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned for the weekend on Thursday, but canceled the Senate’s scheduled recess next week, so a vote on the legislative package could happen next week if the House passes the bill.

At least 10,600 schools have closed across the U.S., affecting at least 4.9 million students. Five states have closed their schools entirely: Ohio, Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and Washington.

(WJTV) – Leaders with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith joined representatives from the Mississippi Food Network (MFN) on Monday. They discussed the Farmers to Families Food Box program.

So far, more than 705,000 food boxes have been distributed in Mississippi. The program is a USDA-led effort designed to assist families, farmers and food distributors who have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thanks to a partnership between the USDA and MFN, more boxes will be delivered in October. Greg Ibach, USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, said food insecurity has been an issue for a long time.

“Hunger is a problem across America, even in good times, and it’s a tough problem to try and address because it has so many different causes and reasons. But when people lose their jobs unexpectedly and immediately and in large numbers, it puts stress on our foodbank system,” Ibach stated.

The food boxes used to be broken up between fruits, meat and dairy. Now, the boxes will be a combination of the three to give people more of a balanced box.

57,57,"Apr 5, 2019",Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s Extra Table gets to tell its story to national audience as featured charity at D.C. gala,"It all started with a phone call and a plea from a Hattiesburg mission pantry. They’d exhausted their food inventory and needed help. Ringing chef/restaurateur Robert St. John was the right call.

Edwards Street Fellowship Center’s plea became the start of Extra Table, founded by St. John when he tapped decades of restaurant industry experience for a solution. The fastest and easiest way to get the food where it was needed: Call his Sysco rep, place an order and have the truck drop-ship it at the agency.

Once he realized the extent of food insecurity in the state, Extra Table reached out, expanding by as much as 50 percent annually early on. Now marking its 10th anniversary year, Extra Table tackles hunger and delivers to 39 local food pantries and soup kitchens from north Mississippi to the Gulf Coast, east to west, with nutritious, fresh food on a regular basis.

In addition to that milestone, Extra Table is the featured charity of Taste of the South (TOTS). The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded by Southern transplants shares flavors of their region while supporting home state causes. Representing 13 Southern states, TOTS annually raises more than half a million dollars for charities throughout the South (and one D.C.-based charity). Its annual black-tie gala (April 6 at the Washington Hilton this year) draws 2,300 guests and typically sells out.

“I’m so honored — and grateful,” St. John says. “As someone who has served Southern food to restaurant customers for over 31 years, I’m happy to be feeding healthy food to our neighbors most in need. The organizers of this event will be happy to know that 100 percent of their donations will go to purchase healthy food for mission pantries and soup kitchens throughout Mississippi.”

Extra Table had been on TOTS’ radar for a number of years. With 2019’s theme of Community Resilience, “Extra Table was on our short list” of possible selections, says Alex Monié, on TOTS’ Mississippi committee. Fundraising, with the 13 states working together, has topped $600,000 in recent years, he says, with most coming from home state support.

“Every state will receive a piece of the pie. Extra Table — because Mississippi is the featured state and they’re the featured charity and we worked hard to make sure we hit our fundraising goals — will receive a pretty significant piece of the pie. … Those numbers, unfortunately aren’t fully baked until after the gala, once all the checks come in. But we hope for it to be over $200,000.”

The recognition also brings a chance to tell Extra Table’s story on a national level, says Extra Table executive director Martha Allen. “To our knowledge, the way that we are set up to feed people isn’t done anywhere else. It’s such an easy template that can be dropped down on top of any state, no matter who the food distributor is, no matter what the demographics look like.”

Its ability to purchase healthy food in volume for consistent delivery, is a key driver, she says. “That food is delivered the last Wednesday of every month. Our pantries know what’s coming and when they’re going to get it, so they can have the confidence they’re going to have the ability to feed the people that they serve. … It’s just the most efficient and effective way to get food into the bellies of people that need it.”

Extra Table’s founding principles are that 100 percent of the money raised goes to food and that it will always be healthy, to help combat other Mississippi woes of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Planning is thoughtful, too, with tear-top tuna packages and pop-top cans, so recipients can access food even if they don’t have a can opener. Breakfast foods and healthy snacks are boosted in the summer, when kids don’t have access to school meals.

Partnerships are vital in the success, Allen says, such as with Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi, the newly formed College and University Anti-Hunger Alliance, Mississippi Center for Justice and all Extra Table’s feeding agency partners. “It wouldn’t work if we didn’t have partners, boots on the ground, all over the state, accepting our food and passing it out. … This is our specialty and that’s their specialty and it works beautifully together.”

“It’s partnerships like Extra Table that have paved the way for successful corporate responsibility programs to have guidance and success,” says Sysco marketing manager Katherine Capocelli. Sysco’s Nourishing Neighbors program provides local dollars to assist in food insecurity and more. “We know the commitment to end hunger is a mutual mission with partners like Extra Table.”

Extra Table’s 10th anniversary year brings other recognition, too. Extra Table is the WellsFest charity this year (with a fundraising goal of at least $50,000), and it’s also Lazy Magnolia Brewery’s charity for 2019.

“The thing that’s so important to us, that we value so much about Extra Table, is that it’s not just food but it’s nutritious food,’ says Ann McCullen, executive director at Edwards Street Fellowship Center, which distributed 230 tons of food in 2018. It serves an average of 1,500 households each month — more than 4,500 individuals — in a seven-county area in the Pine Belt region.

“Being in Mississippi, the majority of the people we serve have the chronic conditions of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes,” McCullen says. “So, when we hand them a can of food that’s packed with preservatives and sodium and sugars … it’s not ideal by any means. We would much rather give them healthy food, and that’s something that Robert has been committed to since the beginning, with Extra Table — that it be as nutritious as possible.”","Edwards Street Fellowship Center’s plea became the start of Extra Table, founded by St. John when he tapped decades of restaurant industry experience for a solution.

58,58,"Sep 11, 2020",PBS NewsHour,1 in 10 Americans don’t have enough food. The pandemic is making things worse,"Tens of millions of Americans were already wrestling with having enough food to eat before the coronavirus came along. Enter a pandemic that launched an historic recession and experts say that need has only grown.

For three years, Jennifer Lawrence has volunteered at the food bank at St. Luke Methodist Church in Tupelo, Mississippi. People who come to her are scared, not only about having enough food but also how they’re going to make it from one day to the next in the middle of COVID-19, she said. One woman in her 70s is now raising her grandchildren after her own child died, Lawrence said.

“Some of them are at their wit’s end,” she said, adding that her clients tell her, “‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”

“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it. I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.'”

Data is starting to catch up to the real-life fallout of dueling health and economic crises, and shows that households of color and those with less income are disproportionately affected so far. In late August, about one in 10 Americans said they did not have enough food in the last seven days, according to new survey data from the Census Bureau out this week. But mounting data suggests those numbers are going up. The Census data also revealed rising in food insufficiency among children over the summer, from 16.8 percent in mid-June to 19.9 percent by mid-July.

In New York City and Los Angeles, roughly one-fifth of residents said over the course of July that they had serious difficulty getting enough food to eat. In Houston, a third of respondents had trouble affording food, according to a poll from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, NPR and Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health

And a slew of COVID-19 relief packages — from unemployment assistance to housing protection — are set to expire by the end of September, weeks ahead of the 2020 presidential election, leaving millions of people vulnerable to worse economic and health outcomes.

Food is one of the first costs people skimp on to try and stay afloat amid turbulent financial straits, and one of the last basic needs to recover once a crisis eases. What someone spends on food “is something that is elastic, as opposed to — your rent is your rent,” said Elaine Waxman, senior fellow at the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

That deprivation can have lasting effects — trouble getting enough food to eat can lay the foundation for chronic illness and reduced health outcomes later in life.

The PBS NewsHour asked health and social safety net experts where the United States stands on food insecurity, who is being hit hardest and what would help people get enough to eat during this crisis.

How we got here

Late last year, before the global rise of COVID-19, one out of 10 U.S. households was food insecure, according to a report published this week from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That amounts to an estimated 35.2 million people, said Alisha Coleman-Jensen, a USDA social science analyst who studies nutrition assistance.

More than half of those households — 58 percent — participated in at least one of the nation’s largest federal nutrition programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and the National School Lunch Program.

Rising unemployment and inflation of food prices are often linked to the number of food-insecure households, Coleman-Jensen said. However, “most food-insecure households are actually employed,” either full-time or part-time, suggesting people’s paychecks don’t go far enough to cover the cost of food, she said during a webinar highlighting the latest USDA report’s findings.

These numbers are comparable to what the Census Bureau found when it asked Americans if they had enough food during the last seven days. For months, the bureau has inquired how households are coping during the pandemic with questions about job status, housing, food, health care and more.

But the way that question is framed could gloss over the realities of food insecurity, which tends to be episodic during the course of a month, Waxman said. People may be fine once they get money or assistance on the first of the month, but by the end of the month, their cash reserves or resources may have dried up. That’s why polls often ask if people have experienced hunger or food insecurity over the last 30 days.

For many in the U.S., financial stability has grown more tenuous in the months since the pandemic began, and could get more dire. With the latest GOP Senate coronavirus relief bill scuttled on Thursday, essentially diminishing hopes of any aid coming before the November election, and federal COVID-19 unemployment insurance set to expire after Dec. 31, more people are struggling to figure out how they will pay rent and eat, Waxman said. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed a federal moratorium on evictions, people are still worried about how they are going to make ends meet. Back in Tupelo, Lawrence said clients come to her and say they don’t know how they can afford rent.

In a year full of examples of the ways systemic racism manifests in all aspects of life, from COVID-19 outcomes to police brutality, food insecurity has also weighed more heavily on Black and brown households than white ones, said Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The health care policy organization, along with partners, surveyed 3,454 Americans between July 1 and Aug. 3 in the nation’s four largest cities — New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston — to see how vulnerable people’s lives and livelihoods have become amid the pandemic. The report detailed how problems were concentrated among Black and Latino households and households with incomes less than $100,000 per year in cities that report some of the nation’s highest cost-of-living. At least half of respondents in each city reported serious financial problems, including trouble paying bills, especially due to medical costs or credit card debt, and fleeced savings.

“Food security is really a basic and fundamental need, and we shouldn’t be experiencing these kinds of problems,” Morita said.

On the ground

After COVID-19 surged in places like New York City and California, it settled into rural pockets of the country over the summer, searing states like Mississippi with some of the country’s worst positivity rates, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Mississippians still suffered among the higher unemployment rates in the country with 10.8 percent of the labor force out of work. And like much of the rest of the country, a disproportionate number of Black Mississippians died after they were infected with the virus, compared to white Mississippians, according to the state department of public health.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry.”

Things got so bad that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves finally issued a statewide face mask mandate on Aug. 4, but stopped short of postponing the start of in-person school days later for thousands of Mississippi children, teachers and staff. Less than a month after classes began, the Mississippi Free Press reported on Aug. 25 that thousands were ordered to stay out of classrooms after hundreds of COVID-19 tests confirmed positive cases in the state’s school system. In the 2019-2020 school year, the USDA said about 357,000 children in Mississippi were qualified to be fed through the National School Lunch Program. That translates to nearly three-quarters of all children in the state’s participating schools.

Mississippi households reported the nation’s highest rates of food insecurity at 15.7 percent late last year, according to the latest USDA data. Since then, Jason Martin has already seen a spike in need at the food pantries he oversees in Northeast Mississippi. As executive director for the Tupelo/Lee County Hunger Coalition, Martin said older residents, who are at greater risk for suffering worse outcomes if infected with COVID-19, fear coming to the pantries to pick up food. At the same time, hundreds of new households are flocking to the food bank because so many people have lost their jobs or been furloughed.

“The numbers we’re serving now are the most numbers we’ve served in the history of the pantry,” Martin said. He said while the pantry typically restricts people to one visit per month, Martin said he has seen an uptick in people who run out and need more food sooner.

Around the nation, more than four out of 10 people who sought help from food pantries were new and needed services as a result of COVID-19, according to Feeding America, a nonprofit network of more than 200 food banks. Based on what he has seen, Martin said he doesn’t expect food pantry demand to return to pre-pandemic numbers “until 2021, until a vaccine is widely available. You’ve got to see that widely available to the community before things start stabilizing.”

What’s next?

Waxman said she foresees “a real uptick in food insecurity and need” for months, if not years. It took Americans a decade to recover from food insecurity brought on by the Great Recession, she said.

The U.S. didn’t enter this coronavirus-fueled recession completely unprepared. During the 2008 financial crisis, lessons were learned that gave policymakers evidence-based tools and strategies to make sure more Americans get enough nutritious food to eat, she said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping. That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”

One tool they used to stem widespread hunger in the U.S. was boosting food stamp benefits across the board, Waxman said. That gave more food to more people when they needed it, and research supports this tactic for avoiding hunger. That’s why it was included in the HEROES Act, Waxman said, but that coronavirus relief package, which was introduced by House Democrats in May, has sat in Congress.

Research shows that cash infusions, such as the extended $600 payments that went out under the CARES Act passed in March, are vital in keeping American households financially afloat and fed, Waxman said. During the Great Recession, individuals received more than $420 billion in stimulus payments, which helped keep households afloat and prevent further job loss, the Hamilton Project reported.

To fix holes in the social safety net, Waxman urged lawmakers to be more consistent with aid. So far in the crisis, the U.S. has adopted a series of policies that weren’t renewed. One example, she said, was authorizing pandemic EBT, or a special debit card used to redeem food benefits, under the CARES Act, which replaced free or reduced price school meals for children who couldn’t return to the classroom because of COVID-19 and would miss free-or-reduced price breakfast and lunch. This benefit is set to expire on Sept. 30. According to the USDA, roughly 30 million children rely on the National School Lunch Program. But because the U.S. has created a patchwork of state, local and federal responses to a global pandemic, more households are falling through the cracks, Waxman said.

“Part of the problem is we’ve had a lot of starting and stopping,” she said. “That makes it really hard for people or states or schools or anybody else to plan.”","I don’t know how I’m going to pay my bills.’”“‘I don’t know how I’m going to make it.

The member agencies then give the food out to those in need in their respective communities. Beady, a native of Flint, Michigan, earned his bachelor’s degree in advertising, a master’s degree in urban counseling and a doctorate in counselor education all from Michigan State University. Beady recently spoke with Sun reporter Nikki Rowell about the work MFN is doing to eradicate poverty-related hunger in Mississippi.

When did the Mississippi Food Network get started and how?

“In 1984. A group of concerned citizens in the Jackson area got together to discuss issues related to hunger and food insecurity in the Jackson metropolitan area and the result of that meeting was the founding of Mississippi Food Network. It started off with a few thousand pounds and a handful of agencies. We’ve grown from those humble beginnings to our location here on Beatty Street. We have 80,000 square feet of space. We have 33 employees. Last year, we distributed 21.4 million pounds of food around the state to Mississippians who are hungry and food insecure. We distribute that food through a network of agencies. We have 430 agencies that are a part of our network. We are a food bank. A food bank is a charitable organization that receives, warehouses and distributes food to those in need. You don’t necessarily have to be poor to be in need. We are a safety net.”

How is the network working to eliminate poverty-related hunger?

“We’re one of 200 food banks affiliated with Feeding America. Feeding America is the largest organization of its kind in the United States with the mission of trying to eliminate hunger. So, most states have up to five Feeding America affiliated food banks. Mississippi is one of maybe 15 states with only one Feeding America affiliated food bank physically located in the state. We have 56 counties that we’re responsible for getting food to through our 430 agencies. So, if an agency is located outside of a 50-75 mile radius, we will pack up our 18-wheelers and take 40,000 or so pounds of food to a drop-off area and then the agencies in that particular area will pick up their orders and take it back to their respective communities. If they’re within that 75-mile radius, they’ll come to us and pick up their orders to take back to their communities.”

What sort of agencies does MFN distribute through?

“We have contracts through the state of Mississippi that we are responsible for the distribution of federal foods. Most of our agencies are church-related, 501c3. We distribute food through Stewpot, Salvation Army and a number of churches around the state in our service area.”

How many people does the network feed each month?

“About 150,000 through those agencies.”

Could you tell me how many pounds of food are distributed each month?

“We’re moving about a million and a half pounds of food through here a month. That comes out to about 21.4 million pounds each year.”

What is the network’s service area?

“For Feeding America purposes, we cover 56 counties. We distribute food for USDA. For USDA purposes, we’re responsible for getting food to all 82 counties in the state.”

How much is needed annually to keep the network going?

“Our annual operating budget is $3.8 million. So, we need that to do what we do. Let me add also, when you start looking at the hunger figures in Mississippi and nationally, Feeding America figures show us that Mississippi is the hungriest state, statistically speaking. Some 600,000 go to bed either hungry or not knowing where their next meal is coming from. In that regard, we are the hungriest state in the nation. So the need is there.”

What are some of the other programs that the network offers?

“We have a program where we pack up 30-pound boxes to deliver to senior citizens every month. The agencies that I mentioned, we have online ordering where they can become aware of the food we have from USDA and donated. They see what’s on the list and place their ‘orders.’ I say orders in quotes because we don’t sell food to anybody. They order their food electronically and come pick it up and distribute it to the people in need in their respective service areas. We have about 25 backpack programs. Individuals and organizations pack up the food and we will have it distributed to schools in the area. At the end of the week, you provide healthy meals and snacks for them over

the weekend. There are many students around the state of Mississippi who rely on the meals provided in the schools in order to stave off hunger and many of them go hungry over the weekend. Hence the need for the backpack program.”

Are the meals and snacks in the backpacks items that children can safely prepare on their own?

“Absolutely. Healthy, nutritious snacks that they can prepare for themselves.”

Can you tell me some of the ways MFN educates the community about healthy food choices and exercise?

“We have nutritionists on staff, and they will go out to the agencies and provide food preparation demonstrations throughout our service area indicating how people can prepare the foods that we make available to them.”

What does it mean to you to have a hand in providing food to those in need?

“This is an extremely satisfying job to be able to see and measure the impact that you’re having on hunger in the state of Mississippi. It’s just a joy to come in in the mornings and see the semi-truck trailers lined up and unloading food in order to get that product out to the people who need it. It is particularly satisfying during the holiday season to know that the work that we do is going to help some youngsters and families throughout the state of Mississippi enjoy a nutritious and hunger-free holiday because of the work that we are doing.”

Do you provide holiday fixings around this time of year?

“We just had a turkey drive. We had a record-breaking year in terms of the number of turkeys that were collected. We collected 2,323 turkeys this year to provide to the agencies that will take and distribute to their respective communities. One of the ways that we are able to provide food is through organizations that will provide food drives for us. The kids over at Madison Central collected four trailer loads of food to bring to the warehouse to allow us to distribute through our agencies.”","Dr. Charles Beady is the Chief Executive Officer of Mississippi Food Network (MFN), a food bank that distributes purchased and donated food to approximately 415 member agencies across the state.

Mississippi communities are among the most disadvantaged in the nation, based on income levels, health and social mobility, according to a recent study.

A recent analysis by researchers at the University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions initiative and Princeton University’s Center for Research on Child Wellbeing created a nationwide index for counties it found to be at a ""deep disadvantage"" in the country.

The study looked at poverty and deep poverty rates, life expectancy and low birth rates, among other factors.

It revealed five separate counties in Mississippi in the top 10 list as the most poor areas in the nation.

Those counties and their rank are:

3. Claiborne County

4. Issaquena County

5. Holmes County

7. Leflore County

9. Coahoma County

The study also listed a total 21 counties in the state in its top 100 index, which represents more than 20% of the entire country.

Child hunger in Mississippi is real: Let's solve the food insecurity problem.

The study— in its analysis— found three trends:

Rural counties are much more likely to be disadvantaged. Of the top 100 most disadvantaged communities, 80 are rural—including 19 rural counties in Mississippi. Only nine are cities. This finding is significant because rural areas are more likely to lack infrastructure and investment to alleviate poverty.

Disadvantage is clustered and largely driven by historical context. Regions with high levels of disadvantage include the Mississippi Delta, the Cotton Belt, Appalachia, Tribal Nation Lands, areas near the Texas-Mexico border and the Rust Belt cities of Cleveland; Detroit; Flint, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. One theme across these areas of deep disadvantage is a long history of racial and environmental exploitation.

Disparities in health and economic outcomes: In terms of health, people living in the most disadvantaged areas are more likely to die a full 10 years before their counterparts in the most advantaged areas. The average poverty rate of the 100 most disadvantaged communities (34.8%) is more than four times higher than the poverty rate among the 100 most advantaged communities (7.3%).

Tof the Mississippi counties in the top 10 are along the Mississippi River. Four of the counties in the top 10 are located in South Dakota, home to the Native American Sovereign Tribal Nations.

The state of Mississippi has long ranked at the bottom when it comes to obesity, with data suggesting that nearly 75 percent of residents in the Magnolia State are overweight.But not everyone is getting a seat at the table. There is also research showing that many people, including children, are living hungry in Mississippi.“I don’t understand how, and why, you know, people go hungry in Jackson,” said Dave Melton, sensei at Melton School of Martial Arts.Feeding America says more than 61,000 people living in Hinds County are food insecure, meaning they can’t afford to consistently feed their families. That’s 25 percent of the county's population.“But in some areas, it’s up to 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent of the residents are dealing with food insecurity,” said Tyson Jackson, program coordinator for Jackson Meals Matter. To make matters worse, a lot of residents live in food deserts, which are in areas without grocery stores.“Growing up in Jackson, there were grocery stores everywhere, and we've seen, again, that economic divestment, and so, when individuals don't have access to sustainable food, healthy fruit, vegetables, meats, dairy products in walking distance of where they live, then that limits their access,” said Dr. Ebony Lumumba, first lady of Jackson.The Jackson Meals Matter program is getting a strong push from Lumumba.“I think our overall goal, to summarize it, is: Make sure that every child in the city of Jackson has access to three meals a day, every day,” Jackson said.“We’re at schools, community centers, churches, community organizations,” Lumumba said. “We simply need people who have the facility to prepare the meals and to serve them to the population. We’re hoping to bring them into the community and not ask the community to come to us.”Lumumba said this is phase one of Jackson Meals Matter. It’s already paying dividends for the children at the Melton School of Martial Arts.“The food is really good, but it’s not enough for some,” Melton said.Melton would like to see the program allow children to take food with them. There is a need, not just in Jackson, but in every part of the metro.“I do get $60 a month in SNAP benefits, but $60 a month doesn’t feed three people,” said Mary Craker.Craker is confined to a wheelchair, has very limited income and is raising her sister’s two daughters. Craker said she was too ashamed to ask for help, but she got over her fears and now receives help from the food pantry at Wynndale Baptist Church in Terry. “Pick up the phone and call somebody. The Mississippi Food Network will help you, in more ways than one,” Craker said.","THIS IS FOOD REDLINING...THIS IS FOOD APARTHEID ON A PEOPLE.

65,65,"Aug 27, 2020",WSAW,Chopped champ Nick Wallace raises awareness about food insecurity and how communities can help,"WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Having access to healthy food is a global challenge and one that impacts thousands of US cities and over 40 million people nationwide. For many Americans -- particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and rural areas -- small grocery stores that once helped to feed the community have been closed and replaced by convenience stores, and liquor stores that primarily sell ultra-processed junk and snack foods.

According to Feeding America, even in the world’s greatest food-producing nation, children and adults face poverty and hunger in every county across America. The statistics are alarming:

In 2018, more than 37 million people struggled with hunger in the United States, including more than 11 million children.

A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life.

Children are more likely to face food insecurity than any other group in the United States.

In Mississippi—which has the highest obesity rate of any state—over 70 percent of food stamp eligible households travel more than 30 miles to reach a supermarket. Adults living in “food desert” counties lacking large supermarkets are 23 percent less likely to consume the recommended fruits and vegetables than those in counties with supermarkets. As part of Dole’s promise to sustainably provide good nutrition for 1 billion people by increasing access to under-served communities, the brand recently launched an initiative, partnering with Boys & Girls Club, Up in Farms, Smoothie King, which addresses nutritional access and education needs in one of America’s largest food deserts.

Nationally recognized Chef Nick Wallace joined NewsChannel 7 at 4 on Thursday to discuss food insecurity, how we can educate communities about proper nutrition, and how people can help in their own communities. He also showcased simple, healthy dishes that promote optimal nutrition and discussed the unique approach Dole is taking by empowering kids to make better choices by learning about where their food comes from and how to cook it.

66,66,"Dec 21, 2019",NPR,New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion,"New SNAP Rule Impacts College Students By Limiting Benefits And Adding Confusion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Danny Moloshok/AP Danny Moloshok/AP

Some low-income college students are among the 688,000 food stamp recipients projected to lose benefits as a result of a Trump administration rule announced Dec. 4. While the rule explicitly targets ""able-bodied adults without dependents,"" it also limits food assistance for a share of college students at a time when campuses across the country are grappling with how to respond to food insecurity.

The new rule makes it harder for states to waive the requirement that adults work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — or SNAP — benefits. Policy experts say it will limit benefits for college students enrolled less than half of the time while further complicating the already confusing process of determining students' eligibility and connecting them to resources.

""As long as a student is at least half-time, they are not considered an [able-bodied adult without dependents] subject to SNAP work requirements, so that new rule would not impact them,"" says Kathryn Larin, director of the Education Workforce and Income Security Team at the Government Accountability Office. ""The group that it would impact would be students enrolled less than half-time.""

Most college students are excluded from receiving SNAP by design, Larin says.

This is because Congress created the program with the image of a ""traditional"" student in mind: someone entering college directly from high school, financially reliant on their parents, with no income or dependents.

But this archetype is far from universal, says Parker Gilkesson, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy who specializes in income and work supports. Only about 1 in 4 students attend a four-year institution immediately after high school.

Many college students are older or are parents themselves. And few have a financial safety net: Countless families are spending all they have just to send their children to college, let alone pay for their food and other necessities, she says.

""[Congress] did recognize there are circumstances where students could and should be eligible for SNAP, and so they set up a number of exceptions from this prohibition against college students getting SNAP,"" Larin said. ""What are those exemptions, who is eligible for them, how do you meet those exemptions? That's where the confusion comes in.""

In order for college students to be eligible for SNAP, they must first meet income and asset limits, household qualifications and immigration status requirements. Those who are enrolled less than half of the time — as defined by their school — can then qualify under standard SNAP rules.

Students enrolled more than half of the time may qualify for SNAP by meeting one of a number of criteria, which include being responsible for a dependent child younger than 6, working at least 20 hours a week in paid employment, receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, participating in an on-the-job training program, being outside the 18-49 age range, and being unable to work for health reasons.

""No matter if they're full time, part time, half time, even taking one class, [students] are taking the initiative to really better themselves and grow and further their academic career,"" Gilkesson says. ""They shouldn't be punished for not being able to find steady employment in the economy that we are in today.""

Gilkesson says it is unclear exactly how many students will lose benefits as a result of the new rule, particularly because able-bodied adults without dependents are not necessarily also classified as students if they are enrolled part time. But she adds it is clear that the rule will disproportionately impact young people, people of color and those who struggle to find employment, leaving them without much-needed food assistance.

""Most people who receive SNAP who can work, do work,"" she says. ""But there are a lot of jobs and specifically low-wage jobs out here that have volatile schedules ... people can be let go at any time, so we shouldn't allow people to go hungry just based on their ability to maintain work.""

According to National Center for Education Statistics data on unduplicated year-round enrollment, 5.8 million students were enrolled in public two-year colleges in fall 2017. About 2.1 million were full time, and 3.7 million were part time. Gilkesson says that while there are more students enrolled part time in community colleges than in four-year institutions, food insecurity exists on all types of campuses.

Yet there is no national estimate for how many college students do not have enough to eat. This was among the findings of a 2018 Government Accountability Office report that also said almost 2 million at-risk students who were potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits in 2016.

Only 4 in 10 students who are potentially eligible for SNAP are actually enrolled in the program, according to Gilkesson. This is due to perceived stigma as well as confusion about who can apply for SNAP and how to do so.

""The information that's available from the USDA ... is difficult to find on their website and also hard to understand, it's very legal language,"" says Larin, adding that people whose jobs it is to connect college students with these resources may struggle to understand the criteria. Advocates worry that the new rule will exacerbate this confusion.

The GAO report released last December made two recommendations: that the Food and Nutrition Service (which is part of U.S. Department of Agriculture) improve the information on its website to make it easier to find and understand, and that it take a more active role in sharing states' best practices for connecting students to SNAP. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations but has not yet implemented them as of mid-December 2019.

Gilkesson received SNAP in college and was a SNAP worker at a county agency in North Carolina prior to her current job. She says it was not until she saw the other side of the ""intricate"" process that she realized how much information she never received as a student, both because she didn't know what to tell workers and because they didn't always know what to ask.

As a SNAP worker, she saw the impact that fresh food and hot meals had on clients' lives.

""You need food to live, you need food to work, you need food to thrive,"" Gilkesson says. ""And hunger does not make people more employable either.""

In fact, she adds, hunger makes it harder for people to find well-paying jobs that align with their skills and often leads to cycles of being laid off, having to find a new job quickly and missing out on the opportunity to gain the education, training and skills necessary for more meaningful and sustainable employment.

She says research shows that SNAP encourages work and that the idea that people experiencing poverty don't want to get jobs is ""implicit bias.""

The Trump administration says the new rule is intended to promote SNAP recipients entering the workforce. Critics have slammed the change for eliminating food assistance for nearly 700,000 people, many of whom already struggle to find work.

Gilkesson says it is concerning that college students will lose benefits, but the prevalence of food insecurity should be an issue regardless of who is experiencing it.

""No one should be hungry,"" she says. ""That's a basic necessity. And when we start to think about it in that way, we really will start to see the policy change that we need to see.""

67,67,"Sep 17, 2019",Mississippi Public Broadcasting,Farmers Markets Bring Together Communities in Mississippi Delta,"Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming. It was founded by former slaves, and agriculture was part of its history from the beginning. But by the mid-1960s, many African Americans in this part of state were starving. It was so bad that then U.S .Senator Robert F. Kennedy traveled to Mississippi to investigate. Fast forward 50 years and food insecurity is still a problem. But as MPB’s Alexandra Watts reports, there’s a program that’s trying to tackle hunger – one fresh vegetable at a time.

It’s a Saturday morning in Mound Bayou, and LeBroderick Woods is making sure everything is in order for the day for the weekly mobile market put on by Delta Fresh Foods Initiative.

“These are some sweet potatoes that are about 89 cents per pound that were picked out at the Alcorn [State University] farm this morning,” Woods, who is the market manager, points out as he walks around the market. “Here is okra that’s about a dollar and 25 cents per pound.”

Shopper Angela Henderson eyes boxes of red and green tomatoes, potatoes and okra. She’s here because her small town does not have a grocery store.

“It helps us a lot to get everything we need in one place,” Henderson said after buying okra for her meal. “It is very economical and very healthy.”

In addition to Mound Bayou, the mobile market sets up in Shelby and Winstonville on alternating weekends. The market is always parked in a central location so people can walk to it.

Woods said the nearest grocery store is nine miles and a highway away.

“It’s been a struggle. Mound Bayou is considered to be a food desert because they’re so far away from your nearest Walmart – you have to go to Clarksdale or Cleveland, and if you don’t have transportation, that can be a big issue,” Woods said. “One of the hugest parts is transportation and getting to the locally grown food or fresh food.”

The options close by are not the healthiest options.

“[There are] no stores. We have a Bob's Express that sells fried chicken. But nobody around here in the Mound Bayou area sells fresh produce,” Tanielle Woods explains.

Woods is a college sophomore and youth ambassador with the market. Today, she is one of three youth ambassadors at the market.

Listen to Tannielle Woods on healthy eating:

“My name is Tanielle Woods, I am a sophomore at Mississippi Delta Community College and my major is physical therapy. I’m young and in college and I thought that maybe eating noodles and fried chicken was okay, but eating healthy is not bad.”

The youth ambassadors help grow the food and work in the market. As Woods describes it, they are there from “seed to consumer.”

“They'll bring the price down [on] the unhealthy things and the healthy things we have to pay an arm and a leg for,” said Samuel Ferguson, another youth ambassador. The market accepts cash, card and SNAP benefits.

“I think it's important for every community to have fresh produce and have it for cheap, affordable prices, so we can get it.”

Price and transportation concerns went into how the market runs. Before starting the market, Delta Fresh Foods Initiative surveyed community members to see what they wanted.

Rachael Carter of Mississippi State University said community engagement offers more to rural markets.

“In rural communities when they don't have those options of grocery stores, a market can come in and set up wherever they want to have it in the community,” Carter said. “You can put it where people can walk to the market [and] provide a variety of farm produced products. That’s a wonderful thing for a community that just lost a grocery store.”

In Bolivar County, more than one in four people don’t have reliable access to quality food. In Mississippi, around 16 percent of households are food insecure – and the state ranks second in the nation. Many of the most food insecure regions are in the Mississippi Delta.

A United States Department of Agriculture study found that food insecurity is associated with ten chronic diseases. According to County Health Rankings, Bolivar County’s quality of life ranks 72 out 81 Mississippi counties.

Down the road from the market is The Delta Health Center, which opened in the mid 1960s and was one of the first of its kind in the country. According to Out in the Rural: A Health Center in Mississippi and its War on Poverty by Thomas J. Ward Jr., current issues like transportation and health were prevalent in Bolivar County and the Delta years ago.

David Holben, a professor and director of Food and Nutrition Studies at the University of Mississippi, said these health issues still exist.

“I think people equate the health problems we have in our state and nation to over-nutrition and access to too much food,” Holben said. “When in reality, it might be [that] we have access to high fat and high sugar food that tastes good, and yet are lacking nutrients.”



But Holben said having farmers markets can benefit communities.

“So farmers markets do definitely increase access to healthy food available in rural communities,” Holben said. “They do play a crucial role in people having access to fresh and healthy food in their local area. We’re really talking about a local food system.”

“When farmers markets are in communities and people are using it, there is a health benefit in terms of improved diet,” Darcy Freedman of Case Western Reserve University said. But she also notes farmers markets is not a sole health solution.

“It’s going to be a compilation of many factors that are overall making healthy foods more affordable [and] making them more available in addition to other things like promoting walkability and economic opportunity.”

Back at the market, Henry Herman stands near a red wheelbarrow loaded with green watermelon. Herman had a stroke a few years ago, and said he’s learned about the importance of healthy eating.

“If you get healthy food like it was back in the day, I guarantee there would be a lot less people dying or having health problems,” Herman said.

Larry Haywood also stops by the market. He’s a local grower who is helping the youth ambassadors growing the food.

He, too, has had health issues and says there is a power in eating better.

“You don’t realize that until you start eating healthier...and you realize how to eat to live rather than live to eat,” Haywood said.

LeBroderick Woods on what a ""Good Food Revolution"" Means:



""Because it’s a change. It’s a paradigm change -- it’s a paradigm change for the community. We’ve gotten so stuck on instant gratification – your Big Macs, your quick meals and things of that nature. We’ve kind of gotten away from things we were raised on – the fresh produce and grandmama’s cooking and things of that nature. So good food is not just good tasting, it’s good for the spirit. It’s good overall. It build character even if you will.""

Right now, the market is only in Mound Bayou once every three weeks, but LeBroderick Woods wants to see it expand.

“I hope it grows to us having our own market here, and it being a consistent thing throughout the week -- not just a Saturday event,” says Woods, who comes back every week to his hometown. That it’s something that can be prominent and it lasts through seasons – summer, winter, fall all of the above. That it’s our own Walmart or grocery store here in Mound Bayou.”

Delta Fresh Foods Initiative hopes customers walk away with more than just fresh produce. The organization wants them to learn how to live and eat healthier.","Mound Bayou is one of many Mississippi Delta towns that sits on rich soil worthy of farming.

The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

""Within that area, only about 5 percent of those grocery stores supply locally-sourced produce, he said. ""There's about 20 grocery stores in the city. That's about one for every 10,000 people.""

When it comes to assessing a location as food insecure or not, Bartlett said there are a number of factors that come into play.

""It really has a situation of numbers of people, grocery stores, and the amount of fresh produce and nutritious foods that are available in a particular populous. Really, within a food desert only about maybe 23 percent or so of the people have access to fresh produce,"" he added.

Dole decided to first introduce its #SunshingForAll campaign to Jackson due to the city's lack of accessible public transportation, a surplus of fast food establishments, and a median income of just over $35,000, Bartlett said.

While many communities are impacted by a lack of adequate access to healthier food options, Dole is leaning on the public to help the company decide which locations should be next. Bartlett said all people have to do is log on to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter and explain to the company why their location qualifies as a food desert while using the tag #SunshineForAll.

""We're looking forward to expanding this. This is something that is an ability for us to get in and help to spread knowledge and awareness, affordability, accessibility, and also to improve the education of an area about healthy products, nutrition,"" Bartlett said.","The campaign looks to provide nutritious foods to underserved and poorly served communities, starting in Jackson, Mississippi, said Brad Bartlett, Dole packaged foods president, told Cheddar.

On Dec. 23, the Jackson Meals Matter program team up with Chefs for the Culture and the Love JXN: Save Ourselves campaign to cook and distribute hot meals at the Grove Park Community Center in northwest Jackson. The event, titled ""Holiday Meals for Jackson's Kids,"" will begin at 11 a.m. and end at 2 p.m.

As the poorest state in America, food insecurity is especially profound in Mississippi. Approximately 600,840 Mississippians, or one in four people, do not have access to enough food. One-quarter of children in the state and more than half of Mississippi's elderly population go to sleep hungry.

In Hinds County alone, 61,720 people go without enough food. As the Mississippi Food Network points out, the food-insecure population of Hinds County is larger than the hungry population in all of North Dakota.

Food insecurity is linked to numerous adverse health effects. For children, lack of access to nutrient-rich foods can lead to developmental problems and poor educational outcomes. Because unhealthy foods tend to be cheaper than nutrient-rich ones, families who are struggling to make ends meet are more likely to consume foods that harm their physical health. And since families must often decide between placing food on the table or meeting their other basic needs, food insecurity has also been linked to housing and transportation insecurity and lack of access to medical care.

Summers and holiday vacations are particularly difficult times for families struggling with food insecurity, as school breakfasts and lunches are the only times that a child may eat during the day. Mississippi ranks 47th in the country for child participation in school summer lunch programs, the Food Research and Action Center reports. Only 8% of Mississippi kids ages 18 and younger are currently enrolled in summer lunch programs.

The average cost of a meal in Mississippi is $2.93, the nonprofit Feeding America found. The agency estimates that an additional $286,997,000 in funds is required to overhaul food insecurity in Mississippi.

In 2018, the City of Jackson received a $120,000 grant from the National League of Cities to combat hunger. The City used the money to launch the Jackson Meals Matter program.

Children can pick up meals at the Grove Park Community Center on 4126 Parkway Ave. from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. For more information or to volunteer, reach out to Tyler Jackson at [email protected] or 601-201-7324.

The new coronavirus has ushered in uncertainty for everyone, and this is especially true for low-income families and vulnerable populations across our state. The pandemic is heightening the uncertainty, financial instability and food insecurity faced by one in five Mississippians every day. It's also illuminating the dangers of inadequate access to affordable and quality health care and the desperate need for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed HR 6201, the Coronavirus Response Act. This act, in part, allows:

Expanded access to SNAP, WIC, and the emergency food assistance program during the pandemic;

Immediate paid sick leave and paid family leave, expanded unemployment insurance, vital nutrition aid;

More Medicaid funds for states; and

Free COVID-19 testing and treatment, including for Americans without health coverage.

What do Mississippi’s legislators do in the face of the unprecedented challenges caused by the spread of this pandemic? Do they rush to draft legislation to ensure protections for its most vulnerable citizens? No. Also on Tuesday, the Mississippi House of Representatives declared a three-week recess, effectively stalling any relief struggling Mississippians might receive. The Mississippi Senate suspended its session the following day.

Mississippi coronavirus: What state employees need to know

Session halted: Mississippi lawmakers reject bill

As we are all too aware, when it comes to this virus, a lot can happen in three weeks. For many Mississippians, it is the difference between life and death. I implore Mississippians to contact U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker to voice support for the Coronavirus Response Act and to contact their state representatives to urge compassionate action in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our elected officials’ failure to act immediately and decisively in the face of such imminent disaster is unconscionable and unacceptable. Contact your state legislator to demand the following actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Expand Medicaid to increase access to COVID-19 treatment for 163,000+ low-income Mississippians.

Leverage TANF dollars to offer emergency sick leave to low-income families.

Lift the legislature's 2017 prohibition on SNAP work requirement waivers previously available during economic downturns and job shortages. The pandemic illustrates the fragility of the service industry and many low-wage job opportunities.

Exempt groceries from Mississippi's general sales tax. Mississippi is one of just three states without a tax break on groceries, heightening hunger and poor health.

Place a moratorium on evictions, following the lead of several states and cities doing the same nationwide. Jackson's eviction rate is among the highest in the country and Mississippi's new law authorizing immediate eviction is among the harshest.

72,72,"May 22, 2020",,More American children could go hungry during pandemic,"Feeding America released a study this week, which examines food insecurity at a more local level. The study found that in some regions of the US, more than half of all children could be considered “food insecure.”

Food insecurity is defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. In areas such as Kusilvak, Alaska and East Carrol Parish, LA, more than half of all children will lack consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

In Louisiana, more than one in three children are projected to be “food insecure” this year. New Mexico, West Virginia, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama and Nevada join Texas as states with projected child food insecurity rates of more than 30%.

The state that will see the largest per capita jump in food insecurity is North Dakota, with its rate of food insecure children nearly doubling. But North Dakota had a low food insecurity rate before the pandemic.

""This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,"" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. ""The long-term effects of COVID-19 may be substantial, but the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and over 60,000 partner food pantries and meal programs has a footprint in every community to help serve our neighbors during this time.""

Last month, Feeding America announced that it projected a $1.4 billion budget shortfall through the fall to handle the influx of demand at food banks nationwide.

“The people we serve and the charitable food system in the United States are facing a ‘perfect storm,’ with surges in demand, declines in food donations and volunteers, and disruptions to normal operating procedures, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Babineaux-Fontenot. “It is all of our neighbors who now more than ever need help putting food on their tables.”

The Oxford Food Pantry has gone through changes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the Pantry’s inception in 1982, it has tried to help those with food insecurity. In order to ensure the safety of our volunteers and clients, the Pantry had to go to a prebag system that is placed into the client’s vehicle.

The Pantry has seen an increase of 50–70 percent in people needing food. The Pantry has struggled with supply from our regular sources, but received a large quantity of canned goods from the MS Food Network in Jackson. Thanks to former Mayor Pat Patterson for providing a large truck and driver to make this shipment possible.

Many thanks to First Baptist of Oxford and Community Church for running the Pantry during the challenging months of March and April. And the Pantry greatly appreciates all of the other volunteers who have gone above and beyond during this difficult period.

The Pantry extends gratitude to all who have made food and cash donations. For those who wish to support the Pantry, please submit checks to the Oxford Pantry, P.O. Box 588, Oxford, MS or via PayPal link: paypal.me/pantryoxfordms.

76,76,"Jul 6, 2020",FoodNavigator-USA.com,"‘The nation is going to need all of our help,’ Chobani president says unveiling new charity SKU","All profits from the new Food Bank Batch SKU will be donated to Feeding America, an organization of more than 200 food banks that provides meals to those in need – a number that the non-profit estimates could climb an additional 17.1 million this year due to the pandemic.

Even though some states are starting to reopen their economies, “we are still very much living with this virus … and the situation hasn’t changed fundamentally. If you look at the economy, if you look at the number of unemployed, the case rate – they are very similar to where they were a couple of months ago. And the way we see it, the nation is going to need all of our help,”​ to get through the pandemic and economic downturn, Chobani president Peter McGuinness told FoodNavigator-USA.

He explained that with the launch of this new charity SKU, Chobani “continues to do our part through food to help people who are unemployed, underemployed and hurting.”​

Chobani’s Food Bank Batch allows Mississippi Food Network to feed more children this summer​ When Chobani emailed Mississippi Food Network earlier this summer to share that it would be launching a limited-edition Greek yogurt to raise money for Feeding America food banks, program manager Catherine Montgomery said she was “so excited and felt so blessed”​ because the donation meant feeding more children who rely on school lunches during the summer. She explained to FoodNavigator-USA that nearly a quarter of children in Mississippi suffer from food insecurity and many rely on schools and child feeding sites for what might be their only meal of the day. But when the coronavirus pandemic broke out, many schools discontinued their feeding programs to minimize risk of exposure to staff and families. “When I learned that we had been blessed with $20,000”​ as part of Chobani’s donation, “we were able to think outside of the box a little bit and… purchase shelf stable summer meals for our summer feeding sites in Sharkey County and Issaquena County, which are two very rural, low-income counties in the state of Mississippi,”​ she said. “We are gong to kick this program off on [July 6] and anticipate running hopefully until Aug. 7, through which the funding will allows us to give 8,000 meals for these two counties to share,”​ she said, adding, “We are so excited for this opportunity and very, very, very thankful for the funding to do so.”​ While not all CPG players are able to give as much as Chobani, Montgomery said that Feeding America is appreciative of all donations – of any size and either as funds or in-kind donations. “Funding is always appreciated. For every $1 donated to the Mississippi Food Network, we’re able to provide six meals, and 95 cents of every dollar goes directly to our programs,”​ she said. “We are also very thankful for anything and everything that does come through the warehouse as in-kind donations, because they allow us to provide more for these families. We don’t take any donation – big or small – for granted.”​ Beyond food and funds, Montgomery said MFN was grateful to receive donations from others earlier this year to expand its fleet of delivery trucks and drivers to meet increased demand. She also said companies have helped by offering advertising that allows MFN and Feeding America to tell their story and educate communities about what is available. While MFN continues to welcome help feeding communities now, Montgomery said that the organization – and likely other food banks nationwide – also need help planning for the future to ensure there is sufficient food for the coming months as well. “Normally we’re gearing up for food drop season, but what we have done to be a little creative in the midst of our current season of life is we’ve begun doing virtual food drops … and we are planning to continue that through the fall,”​ she said. She explained that this approach allows the food banks to stockpile for the lean winter months and holiday season, but without putting additional strain on the food chain and grocery stores now. It also reduces the risk of contaminants entering the warehouse. “The virtual food drives are a great option for those who want to help but not be a hindrance and it is an easy way to assist us in meeting our goals and mission,”​ she said. But, she emphasized again, MFN and Feeding America are grateful for any and all support.

In addition to financially benefiting Feeding America, McGuinness said Chobani hopes the SKU will help shoppers by offering them a new flavor that hasn’t been available before in yogurt and nutritional profile that will lift their spirits and support their health.

“The combination of peanut butter and jelly is delicious and super nostalgic. It is a comfort food and will put a smile on your face” – ​two things that many Americans need as they continue to navigate frustrations associated with social distancing, McGuinness said.

Likewise, each cup of yogurt is made with three cups of milk, which means they deliver “a lot of protein and lot of probiotics. Plus, the peanut butter adds healthy fats. So, it is great nutritionally, in addition to being a lot of fun in terms of the flavor,”​ he added.

Chobani’s support expands beyond new product​

The charity SKU is the latest in a long string of donations that Chobani has made since the outbreak began to help feed Americans, many of whom have lost jobs during the pandemic due to restrictions designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

For example, when the company was forced to close temporarily its SoHo Café as part of a larger economic shut down to stem the coronavirus, it quickly converted the space to a food pantry to serve the local community by passing out bags of donated food from Chobani and several startups and other partners.

In addition, the company has supported Feeding America by donating every day a truck load of fresh product to food banks​ and intake centers nationwide, providing media support and labor.

“We have hit the majority of states at this point, and the donations go where the need is most and grievous, and that is determined by the amount of food, Feeding America and local and community banks,”​ McGuinness said. “We also encourage our employees [in the area] to go and meet the trucks and help unpack and donate it … because these foodbanks not only need the food, they also need the labor.”​

A track record of success​

The Food Bank Batch is not the first time that Chobani has created a charity SKU to raise funds and awareness for a social challenge.

In late 2018, Chobani created a “patriotic”​ Red, White and Blueberry vanilla Greek yogurt with mixed berries​ on the bottom called Hero Batch that asked consumers to “help us donate $1 million to Operation Homefront,”​ a national non-profit that serves America’s military families.

While the SKU was originally planned as a limited edition, consumers loved the flavor and supporting veterans so much that McGuinness said Chobani decided to continue the product.

The company also recently launched a Milk & Cookies SKU around the Milk Matters initiative that supported dairy farmers through the American Farmland Trust. The company donated 10 cents from every four-pack of the SKU to the American Farmland Trust, which focuses on protecting farmland, adopting environmentally-sound farming practices and keeping farmers on the land.

‘Greek yogurt is booming’​

Chobani’s effort to support those in need and its community also come at a time when the business – like all CPG players – faces many challenges due to COVID-19, including uncertainties about whether retailers will review and bring in new products while simultaneously struggling to keep shelves stocked with basics.

McGuinness confirmed though that “the vast majority of our customers will have resets,”​ in July and January – allowing the company to unveil soon “big exciting”​ innovations in Greek yogurt.

“Greek is growing double-digits and I think yogurt is a growth category. It was a growth category before COVID at the end of last year, and it was really turbocharged in the first quarter and now is even higher with COVID because people want healthy snacks, they want probiotics for immunity and protein,”​ McGuinness said.

“So,”​ he added, “we have a large Greek yogurt innovation coming out and we continue to see yogurt as underpenetrated.”​

This month, the company also plans to unveil a new beverage innovation and additional Flips, which McGuinness noted are “just really nice, fun and healthy snacks.” ​In January, he added, the company has a “huge pipeline that will get us in even more categories”​ outside of yogurt.

While McGuinness does not believe any company can take credit for surging sales during the pantry-loading days of the pandemic, he does believe that as consumers continue to eat at home more and buy yogurt that they are forming new habits, which he doesn’t anticipate will change any time soon.","And the way we see it, the nation is going to need all of our help,”​ to get through the pandemic and economic downturn, Chobani president Peter McGuinness told FoodNavigator-USA.

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi‘s food pantry is now known as Grove Grocery and though the name is different, its student-led fight against hunger and the stigma around food insecurity continues.

Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213. Workers wear masks and follow all campus protocols while they serve students. It’s open 3-8 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays and noon to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.

It’s exciting to see the organization grow to be able to help more students, and also help them in new ways, said Chloe Grant, Grove Grocery director and a senior biology major from St. Louis.

“One of my main goals as the food pantry’s director is to help de-stigmatize food insecurity and to help people feel more comfortable with getting the resources they deserve,” Grant said. “I think many students, faculty and staff don’t use the food pantry because they’re embarrassed or because they feel like they aren’t needy enough.

“However, we want everyone to know that we’re here to help them – without judgement – so that they can focus on what really matters in life.”

Grove Grocery has received a $10,000 donation from Kroger, which is part of a new and continuing partnership. Company representatives visited Grove Grocery recently and recorded video interviews with Ole Miss students to share with Kroger employees across the Delta region.

There’s also an Ignite campaign to benefit the pantry and help it to serve as many students and others as possible.

Many people find themselves struggling financially during the ongoing pandemic, said Kate Forster, staff adviser for Grove Grocery. Usage has gone up, including an increased need for hygiene products and other personal items, she said.

“Our utilization has gone up,” Forster said. “It has brought a spotlight to the work of Grove Grocery, and the needs on campus. We would think that on a campus like this and in a place so rich with resources, students would never go hungry. Still, many students are facing very difficult monthly decisions.

“We always want to raise awareness about our services in a de-stigmatizing way. We really try to remove as many barriers as possible to students and employees finding what they need.”

Here’s a full list of Grove Grocery’s services.

While usage has gone up, donations have increased, as well. Forster believes many people find themselves wanting to help others during COVID. She said its rewarding to see the work at Grove Grocery is both student-led and heavily supported by students.

“One in three college students during their undergraduate years will experience food insecurity,” Forster said. “This semester, we’ve given out over 1,800 meals and more than 700 meal swipes.

“We are in a good place to support the community’s needs, and we want to raise awareness. There is a lot of good happening here.”

The pantry takes feedback from clients about their needs, and collects those items. They’ve also partnered to provide “meal swipes” on student and employee ID cards. Those who need swipes can apply here.

Grove Grocery is a good way to help those in need, especially now, said Kieran Murphy, assistant director and a junior management major from Ocean Springs.

“We have so many important goals and ideas we try to implement so that we can ensure the most people get the help they need,” Murphy said. “I am very humbled and honored to serve in a role that allows me to feel that I’m making a difference in people’s lives, and it will always be an experience I will remember and cherish.”

Mary Beth Gillespie, another Grove Grocery assistant director and a senior biology major from Brandon, said she first heard of the pantry as a sophomore. It’s become a “passion project” for her because it helps so many, she said.

“Working with the food pantry has not only impacted my time at Ole Miss, but it has also shaped my outlook on my future and how I would like to continue to combat food insecurity as someone pursuing a career in dentistry,” Gillespie said. “The food pantry is continuing to grow and expand, and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store.”","Grove Grocery provides meals and some hygiene items to students and employees from its location in Kinard Hall, Room 213.

80,80,"Jul 18, 2019",YES! Magazine,How Southern Communities Tackle Summertime Food Scarcity,"Without free and reduced school lunch programs during the summer, many children go hungry. Local organizations and churches are stepping up to help to narrow the food gap. Why you can trust us By Tina Vasquez 6 MIN READ

Jasmine Caston’s weekdays begin before the sun rises. A single mother of two daughters, Caston works full time and goes to school. Every day is a juggling act. To be sure it goes well, she and her children need to be out of the house no later than 6:20 a.m. Nine months of the year, this isn’t a big problem. The girls are in school. But summertime? That’s a different story. A mythology surrounding school’s summer vacation days is that they’re fun and restorative for children and their families. But this mythology has rarely applied to low-income families of color, especially across the American South, where the rates of poverty and food insecurity in the country are highest. “As a parent at work, you worry about your children,” Caston says. “I have to work to maintain the bills, but it’s a struggle, especially to make sure the children are safe and taken care of. I get paid every two weeks and I make minimum wage.” After paying rent, bills, and transportation-related costs, not much is left, she says. Caston has spent her life in Jackson, Mississippi, a state that has the highest rate of child poverty in the nation at 30%. That number surges for African American children in the state, 46% of whom are in poverty.

The mother of two says she’s lucky. Her extended family helps out some. Last year, her parents assisted her with the $80/week fee for a local summer program. These programs can be a huge added expense for families, especially during the summer, when many families struggle with food scarcity. Breakfast and lunch are provided during the school year, but during those three months of summer, many parents struggle to find the funds for these meals. “When they’re at home all day during the summer, it takes extra money and extra food,” Caston explains. “When I was growing up, I remember my mom going to the grocery store three to four times a week. When growing kids are at home all day, they’re constantly opening the refrigerator. Breakfast, snacks, drinks, lunch, it adds up so fast. It’s such a struggle for parents.” The summertime meal gap is the result of access barriers experienced by families like Caston’s, including limited resources when schools are closed. During the school year, 22 million children receive free or reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program, according to the organization Feeding America. When school is out during the summer, however, only 3.76 million receive free or reduced-price meals through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Summer Food Service Program. The SFSP is a federally funded, state-administered program that reimburses providers who serve free meals to children and teens in low-income areas during the summer months.

The summertime meal gap is the result of access barriers, including limited resources when schools are closed.

Many families, however, don’t know about the program. Other inefficiencies, such as the “the congregant feeding requirement,” which necessitates the children eat at designated locations, make the program less effective in some communities, according to the No Kid Hungry Campaign. But Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks, operates several summer food service programs, with the help of SFSP funds, to assist low-income families who face hunger during the summer months. Last year, they served 10 million meals to more than 269,500 hungry children. And some churches and community organizations across the South are forming their own networks to try to end the summertime food gap, with funding from the state and local nonprofits. In Jackson, leaders make sure healthy and nutritious meals come with mentorship and educational opportunities for young people. This includes a free summer camp through the Mississippi Urban League. Caston’s daughters are enrolled in the camp, and she calls it “a blessing.” Beneta Burt is the president and CEO of the Mississippi Urban League, which for 15 years operated as the Mississippi Roadmap to Health Equity. Burt’s primary goal has been addressing health and food disparities in Jackson. While the Mississippi Urban League has long provided summer programs, only recently did the organization partner with the Mississippi Food Network to launch a food pantry, which feeds as many as 50 children breakfast and lunch during the summer.

Burt says it would have been a missed opportunity not to include academic, cultural enrichment, and health and wellness activities as well. “As part of our program, we want young people to also learn important core values. So while it’s very important to us that they have two good meals a day, the other major component is academic and making sure we prevent learning losses during the summer months,” she adds.

Church members want to establish a relationship with all the children, and to let them know they are cared for.

This year, part of the summer program is being funded by 100 Black Men of Jackson, an organization that provides educational opportunities to young African Americans. Members of the organization have taught Caston’s daughters how to plant seeds and grow a garden. In previous summers, mentors with the program also took children in the camp to see the home of Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist and organizer who was assassinated at his home in 1963. Longtime Jackson residents whose children participate in the Mississippi Urban League’s summer programs said they weren’t aware the programs existed. By the time some learned about it, the programs were full. Capacity is an issue, but the Urban League helps the number of children it can. Burt says that if it weren’t for the program, dozens of kids would go hungry and would spend the summer months sitting at home, unsupervised, while their parents work. “We are lucky to offer all of the programming that we do,” she says. “It makes a huge difference in the lives of children.” In Atlanta, Radcliffe Presbyterian Church members have spent the past five years trying to address food insecurity in their community. Beginning in 2014, the church partnered with other congregations and organizations to serve dinner to families in need at a local apartment complex. A year later, Radcliffe began working with Georgia Nutritional Services, which receives USDA funds, to offer summertime lunches to children in the area. This means that each day, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., children under 18 from all over Atlanta can go to the church for lunch. After they eat, they can also play games and work on arts and crafts. Iris Wallace has been a member of Radcliffe for 25 years and assists with much of the food programming, including a “backpack program” during the school year that provides children with shelf-stable food items to take home in their backpacks for the weekend. These programs were born out of necessity, Wallace says.

When the church launched its food programs, the USDA reported that almost 25 percent of the children in metropolitan Atlanta were considered food insecure. Now, about 25 children use the summer lunch program at Radcliffe. Although some are from surrounding neighborhoods, most of the children are picked up by church vans from nearby apartment complexes. If more families dropped in for food or expressed interest in having their children picked up, Wallace says, they would expand the program to meet the needs of the community. As the kids file in the church’s door, Wallace and other members of the congregation greet the children and ask them how they’re doing. They want to establish a relationship with all of the children, and to let them know they are cared for. Doing this is just as important as the food, she says. While Radcliffe’s summer lunch program doesn’t require children to be members of the church or identify as any particular faith, the church uses Luke 14:12-14 as the “guidepost” for its lunch program, Wallace explained. “This [Bible verse] says that when you host a meal, you don’t invite your friends or your relatives or rich neighbors so that they will in turn invite you and you will be repaid. Instead, when you give a meal, you invite the poor… and you will be blessed,” Wallace said. “We are filling these food gaps, and it doesn’t matter what color you are, what language you speak, none of that matters. If you’re a child who is hungry, we will feed you.”

At the peak of the coronavirus pandemic this spring, Sharawn Vinson often woke up crying. A recurring thought was making the unemployed single mother desperate: that her kids could go hungry.

There was also fear of contracting the virus, which has disproportionately hit low-income Black families like hers. Meanwhile, some of the largest protests against racial injustice in decades were transpiring right outside their window, after the family had experienced its own terrifying encounter with police earlier in the year. There were unpaid bills, and feelings of shame from having to go to a soup kitchen in search of a meal.

So Vinson made the painful decision to send 11-year-old twins Mason and Maddison to live with their father, six states to the south, knowing that way they’d at least be fed.

DAILY TOP BROOKLYN NEWS News for those who live, work and play in Brooklyn and beyond Leave this field empty if you're human:

“I needed them to breathe,” Vinson said, wiping away tears in her living room of peeling gray walls in a Brooklyn housing development.

Vinson was not alone in struggling to put food on the table in this historically tumultuous year. In New York City alone, an estimated 2 million residents are facing food insecurity, a number that the city’s mayor estimates nearly doubled in the pandemic amid the biggest surge in unemployment since the Great Depression. The scope of the problem outstrips previous crises such as the Great Recession, according to those who are working to combat it, and it’s not going away anytime soon.

“It’s never been this tragic for such a sustained period of time. Since COVID hit, the numbers of people in line at food pantries and soup kitchens skyrocketed, and it’s not going down,” said Rosanna Robbins, director of food access and capacity at City Harvest, the city’s biggest food rescue organization. “And so I think for us it’s just adjusting to the fact that we expect there to be a real need for free food for a very long time to come.”

When New York schools closed in March, Vinson’s children lost overnight the free breakfasts and lunches they relied on in normal times. Grocery store shelves were poorly stocked, and her pantry was almost bare. She began skipping meals to make sure the children ate, and having them wake up later to try to trick hunger by giving them two meals a day instead of three.

“You never realize how important schools are until you don’t have them,” Vinson said.

-->

“I’d open the refrigerator and I’d see struggle,” she added, “and also sacrifice.”

Oldest daughter Jasmin, 25, and 5-year-old grandson Hunter were living at a homeless shelter but came to visit her at the Lafayette Gardens public housing complex, where the family would share whatever they could scrape together for lunch.

“It got to the point where the kids would unconsciously save a chicken wing for Hunter,” Vinson said.

The family was cooped up for weeks during lockdown, living on just $1,800 a month in worker’s compensation from an on-the-job injury Vinson suffered last year when she fell and tore her meniscus.

From the dusty kitchen window of their 16th-floor apartment, they could see the deserted basketball court, slides and monkey bars at the Classon Playground, closed due to the pandemic.

As she tried to stretch meals of spaghetti and frozen burgers, the kids would argue over everything from who got to control the TV remote to who got the last snack. “Everybody was depressed, angry,” Vinson said.

Vinson was no stranger to hunger, having been raised in poverty by her mom, also a single mother. Vinson had the first of her six children at age 18 and recalls struggling to pay for diapers and food. But from her mother she learned values that have helped sustain her in difficult times, such as grit and generosity.

She took comfort in prayer and gospel music. One song in particular spoke to her: Melvin Crispel III’s “Not the End of Your Story.”

“I know that this is just not it,” she said of getting through the pandemic. “There’s more, there’s something, it’s not the end.”

Across the city, lines at pantries stretched for blocks. Social distancing was complicating food distribution efforts, and many pantries lost older volunteers who stayed home due to high risk of severe effects of COVID-19. A network of churches, volunteers, city government offices, restaurants and immigrant centers stepped in to fill the void.

In May, Vinson saw a Facebook post seeking volunteers for a pantry run by a restaurant owner and a Baptist church, providing hundreds of meals to people in need along with notes bearing inspirational prayers or good wishes such as “What doesn’t kill you will build you.”

“I said, you know what? That’s something that’s up my alley,” said Vinson, whose job before injury and the pandemic was at a shelter for people with mental illnesses and chemical addictions.

Vinson also felt she could set an example for her children. She began bringing Jasmin and the twins to help distribute the food as fellow volunteers, helping teach them values she got from her own mother. It was also a way to make sure her kids got at least one meal a day, from the pantry.

Things seemed to be looking up, but protests and clashes sparked by the police killing of George Floyd raised haunting memories of the incident from earlier in the year when police stormed the apartment building searching for a shooting suspect and pointed their guns at Mason as he was cleaning the litter for his cat, Shadow.

It traumatized the boy and made him angry at police, she said. One day this summer, as she sat outside watching the latest protest, a neighbor called out her name. Across the street, Mason was jumping up and down on top of a patrol car. Vinson ran over.

“And when I grabbed him and I went to chastise him, I was at a loss for words, because how do I tell you not to be angry when four of their brothers in blue had guns to your head?” she said. “How do I tell you not to retaliate?”

Soon after, she called her ex-partner in North Carolina, and on June 4 the twins headed south.

Living without them was hard, she said, but it bought her time to stabilize her ability to provide for them. She saved up food stamps and some money, and found a job working for the 2020 U.S. Census.

One day she asked the restaurant owner who ran the pantry if she could bring back some trays for her housing complex. That effort has since grown to dozens of meals plus groceries and protective face masks that she and other volunteers distribute each Saturday.

The twins finally came home in August, in time for Maddison to celebrate her remote graduation from middle school along with friends and family and for Mason to take part in the first practice of the Brooklyn United Youth Football season.

The police department apologized for the incident involving Mason and hosted him and a group of other kids and their families to discuss their concerns over pizza and chicken wings with high-ranking officers.

“These kids have been enduring a lot in the last couple of months, from the COVID wave to the Black Lives Matter, to the protesters, to the police brutality,” Vinson said. “And not too many times people stop and ask, how do they feel?”

The coronavirus outbreak has slowed significantly in New York compared with earlier this year. But times remain tough: Their rent is four months overdue, and the cable is about to be cut off. On a recent day the bathroom flooded, sending water running through the halls.

Still, Vinson feels fortunate.

“There’s so many people who are out here who are hungry,” she said. “I got my grandson, I got my kids and I got my life. What do I got to complain about?”

The State of Campus Dining: For 2019, the Southern Foodways Alliance (SFA), an institute of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, has explored the labor of food through symposia, films, podcasts, and other media. The SFA collaborated with AL.com, the Montgomery Advertiser, the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today to produce interlocked stories. Together, they shine light on the economics and labor practices of campus dining at Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi — the largest public universities in Alabama and Mississippi.

At $2,000 a semester for a meal plan, Mississippi State University students pay twice what they did about a decade ago for food. Ole Miss dining prices have similarly skyrocketed, up $500 in five years.

Narika Glasper, a recent Ole Miss graduate, recalled the sticker shock. Her scholarships covered housing and tuition, but not food. The price of an “unlimited” meal plan was out of the question, so she settled for a cheaper one that covered 50 meals a semester. Then she learned her unused meal “swipes” didn’t roll over.

“I was mad because that’s money that was wasted,” said Glasper, 22. “I had to pay upfront for that and I didn’t use it, so that’s money that just went to (Ole Miss food contractor, Aramark).”

Glasper isn’t alone in her frustration. Rising meal plan prices at Ole Miss and Mississippi State mirror hikes at colleges around the country and contribute to the increasing cost of a college education. A big reason for the higher costs? Students are paying for more than just food.

MSU and Ole Miss deliver increasing student meal plan revenue to their dining contractor Aramark. Some students are required to pay for meal plans. In return, the schools receive millions of dollars in commissions and bonuses, which they often use to upgrade or build new facilities and add new dining options, according to dining contracts obtained by the Clarion Ledger and Mississippi Today.

“Food service on college campuses is one of the biggest revenue streams for colleges,” said Marissa Meyers, a practitioner and researcher with the Hope Center, an organization focused on college costs.

Food usually makes up the “board” part of room and board costs at colleges. Nationwide, college students now pay on average more than $4,600 a year for board costs, with Mississippi at about $3,800 for public universities, according to U.S. Department of Education data.

This means students are paying substantially more per meal than they would to cook and eat on their own, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and the The Hechinger Report. In 2017, the education-focused news outlet reported that colleges and universities nationwide charged on average $18.75 a day for a three-meal dining contract. Eating at home ran less than $11.

How do dining contracts work?

Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges, said schools often lost money on their in-house food operations, so they gradually turned to one of three multinational corporations – Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group – to run their dining halls, restaurants and catering.

Mississippi State’s operation was losing money when officials decided to switch to Aramark in 2007, said Regina Hyatt, vice president of student affairs, adding administrators also hoped to offer more quality food options. Ole Miss, too, was looking to move from its cafeteria-style, assembly-line dining when it hired Aramark in 1996.

But contractors eventually ran out of “ways to distinguish themselves on the service side” when competing for university contracts, Mac Dermott said. So they began offering more cash to universities in the form of commissions and bonuses.

“Once colleges and universities understood that money was available, they latched onto it.” — Tom Mac Dermott, a dining consultant for colleges

For example, Aramark paid MSU a $5 million bonus for signing a 10-year contract, and later doled out as much as $675,000 a year for unrestricted use, according to its contract. These perks came alongside at least an annual 12% commission for MSU. The university agreed to deliver a set number of meal plans to Aramark in any given year, and if it didn’t reach the minimum, it would pay Aramark the difference.

Ole Miss, meanwhile, received a nearly $8 million bonus in 2014-2015 for food facility upgrades, including a “campus dining refresh.” In the past five years alone, Ole Miss received about $10 million in commissions and delivered Aramark a little more than $117 million worth of meal plan patrons, cash operations, and catering, according to a chart provided by the university.

The cost of these bonuses and commissions are passed on to students, Mac Dermott said. Contractors have to make a profit and “there’s no other place to get it back,” other than charging students higher prices.

Even though buying a meal plan “is much, much more expensive” than cooking at home, Meyers said there are no easy solutions for reducing meal plan costs under the current system. Dining contractors already buy as little food as possible by assuming students won’t use all their meal swipes in a given week, she said.

“The things that students ask for don’t cost money,” Mac Dermott said of meal options. “They’re looking for healthier food, they’re looking for changes in meal plans. It’s the university administration that feels it must have an upgraded dining hall as part of it’s competitive situation.”

Has it paid off with better campus food options?

The dining experience at both campuses transformed under Aramark as student meal prices increased.

Ole Miss added a bevy of branded restaurants and upscale dining hall options, including a “food-court environment” where managers can “interchange menu concepts very easily,” said Scott Schornhorst, Aramark food service director for the university.

It now has more than 20 dining locations with national brands, such as Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. There are vegan and vegetarian options, and stations for students with gluten sensitivities. The newly-renovated student union opened this spring.

MSU followed a similar trajectory. In 2007, a university vice president pledged the move to Aramark would “provide better quality and service throughout campus.”

To achieve this goal, the school reopened a student union with chain restaurants. It renovated Perry Cafeteria, turning it into an “marketplace-style venue.” The university later announced a new $10 million Aramark-branded dining hall, featuring “exhibition cooking stations,” and “framed views of the stadium and the campus beyond.”

“Students are sophisticated in their expectations for their food options,” said Hyatt, the MSU student affairs official. “They expect to have choices, the kind of food that they’re going to have access to (at home).”

Ten years ago, there were no allergen-free stations in the dining hall, she said, but “we’ve adjusted” to student demand. “Our students have a high expectation about what kind of food services are going to be available to them,” Hyatt added, “and that means there’s going to be a cost associated with it.”

At MSU, that cost has risen from $1,000 a semester for the 2007 school year, when Aramark took over, to $2,019 for the “Ultimate” plan today, in which all freshmen on-campus students are automatically enrolled. This far outpaces the cumulative rate of inflation for this period of less than 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Hyatt said the officials aren’t using the rising prices to “pad the pocket of the institution.” She said much of the commissions from Aramark are pumped back into a general scholarship fund and other funds that improve the campus.

At Ole Miss, on-campus freshman are also automatically enrolled in the $1,985 “Rebel Unlimited Plus 1” plan. The university has used money generated by its Aramark contract “to reinvest in the facilities and to fund day-to-day operations that are necessary for the university to handle its parts of the agreement,” said Kathy Tidwell, director of contractual services and licensing.

Other Aramark-managed universities report similar prices: The top plan at the University of Southern Mississippi costs $2,050. At the University of Alabama, the most expensive plan runs nearly $2,000, up by $600 since 2012.

Other contractors have followed a similar path to grow student food plan revenues. In 2013, SodexoMAGIC took over Jackson State University’s dining halls. Back then, the top meal plan ran students $1,447. By this school year, the same plan had increased to $1,979.

Some universities have in recent years begun charging nearly all students for meals – whether they need them or not. Ole Miss as of this year charges almost all undergraduates for $250 in “Flex Dollars” each semester.

And Alabama mandates undergraduates pay $350 for a similar “Dining Dollars” food plan. Prices for these mandatory plans are also rising: Alabama’s contract with Aramark stipulates the university must seek approval from state officials to hike its Dining Dollars price tag by $25 every few years.

With higher prices, how are campuses dealing with student hunger?

Rachel Sumekh is founder and CEO of Swipe Out Hunger, an organization addressing food insecurity on college campuses. The group works with 86 universities across the country, including Southern Miss, allowing students with extra meal swipes to donate them to hungry peers.

The college affordability crisis, Sumekh said, has mostly to do with the increasing cost of living expenses including costly meal plans – not tuition prices.

Financial aid, such as Pell Grants, don’t always stretch far enough to cover all of a student’s living expenses. So instead of taking out a loan, she said, students simply skip buying a pricey meal plan.

Universities, Sumekh said, should be better using grant and scholarship data to identify students that may be hungry – and providing resources so they can eat in the dining halls alongside their peers. Many universities have opened food pantries to help hungry students. But she said that’s not sufficient.

Universities and their contractors are becoming more aware of food insecurity, however, through groups like Swipe Out Hunger and others. MSU has a similar swipe donation program through Aramark, Hyatt said.

In addition, the campus operates Maroon Meals, where students are alerted on their phones when extra free food is available from events around campus. Officials also are working to open a food pantry, she said.

Tyshean Grant, a 2016 Ole Miss graduate, was one of the students who could not afford to pay for a full-priced meal plan her freshman year. So, she said she had to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to offset her costs.

“I see what they’re trying to do with creating a (better meal plan), like combo-type options,” Grant said. “But I also think the options should be affordable.”

Low pay, long hours for campus food employees

The shift to contractors has not generally improved conditions for on-campus food service employees, many of whom are also students. Mac Dermott said contractors generally hire food service employees at the lowest possible rate, with some fringe benefits. Most only receive about 40 weeks of pay in a year because of the shortened college calendar. He said unions have made few inroads.

Universities can negotiate solid terms for their former employees under the new contractor. When Aramark took over at MSU in 2007, for example, employees received a 5 percent pay increase, kept certain benefits and were guaranteed employment for at least a year, according to its contract.

But while several former Aramark employees praised the company’s benefit packages, they expressed concerns about the consistent layoffs, unpredictable work hours and intense workload.

Joshua Taylor, 37, worked as a cook for Ole Miss athletics for years before departing earlier this year. He said he worked at least nine hours a day for $17 an hour with benefits. But the job became too much of a burden, he said, once many of his coworkers were laid off.

“They scaled our entire operation in half and let go of half of my coworkers and I was left there…” Eventually, it was “ten people doing the job of about 30. I’m 37. I’m not interested in doing the work of three people.” — Joshua Taylor, former Ole Miss athletics cook

Brittiney Massey, 30, echoed Taylor’s sentiments. She said layoffs that occur during summer and winter breaks, impact employees negatively.

“Just because layoffs happen doesn’t mean (our) expenses were suspended for that time,” Massey said.

Massey, hired in 2012, worked her way to a supervisor position in the banquet department. During her tenure, she felt underpaid and that coworkers were overlooked for promotions. She left in 2017. “I was the banquet supervisor and I was getting paid $12 an hour, but my hours would go from 12 to 16 hours days,” she said.

Available positions are posted online and promotions are based on “merit and skill,” said Scornhorst, food service director at Ole Miss, and “anyone can apply.” He recognized winter and summer layoffs pose challenges and as a result, the company loses employees. But they are welcome to come back on the “predetermined day,” he added.

“It’s a pause in the system, not a hard shutoff,” he said. “We do run into issues with retention, when locations close up for two months at a time … folks need to make money in those off times.”

These stories ask questions about worker compensation and benefits, university revenue models, and the relationship between universities and the corporate food service provider Aramark. On October 25, during the Southern Foodways Symposium on the University of Mississippi campus, reporters from the project will discuss their findings.

Read Stateline coverage of the latest state action on coronavirus.

Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify the California Department of Food and Agriculture's role in the Farm to Family program.

As the pandemic shut down restaurants this spring, California farmers and ranchers saw their markets drop by half, leaving many with fields full of crops but no buyers. And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

Fortunately for California, the state had a longstanding initiative tailor-made to help with these twin crises. The Farm to Family program, run by the California Association of Food Banks and supported by the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, pays farmers to send surplus produce to food banks.

“All the farmers in California that we work with, they rely on us like we rely on them,” said Steve Linkhart, who directs the program. “When some sources dry up, we're still there to take the products they have in excess. During this time, the farmers have really leaned on food banks to be an outlet for their product.”

More than a dozen states have similar programs, and many have scaled up their efforts this year. Several other states have created or expanded online marketplaces for their farmers and ranchers as many transition to direct-to-customer sales. The programs are a boon as 17 million Americans face food insecurity as a result of the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization.

Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts Quick View Pandemic, China Trade Deal Fuel Farmer Doubts A U.S.-China trade deal is falling short on its commitments.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own $3 billion effort to buy food from farmers and deliver it to food banks. The program delivered 50 million food boxes by the end of July, but has been plagued by controversial contracts, disparities in distribution and difficulties in the supply chain, according to news reports as the program rolled out. The department did not respond to questions.

In the California program, farmers donate their crops but are reimbursed by the food banks for labor and packaging expenses. Those small payments have been just enough to keep some farmers in business, Linkhart said, though he noted that many small farmers don’t have the acreage to make participating worthwhile.

The program had been shipping about 12 million pounds a month before COVID-19, providing food banks with produce such as potatoes, onions, apples, oranges and pears. The volume quickly spiked as high as 18 million pounds during the pandemic’s early months, but tapered off as federal supplies arrived. Linkhart said some of the USDA crops were shipped from out of state, and California farmers have been hurt by the reduced demand.

“If food banks can’t take more product [from the California program], farmers are going to go out of business,” Linkhart said. “That's how much they're actually leaning on us right now. We're doing everything in our power to move their product.”

Farmers have teamed up with food banks in other ways as well. California dairy farmers saw half of their market collapse overnight as restaurants and food service operators shut down. Overwhelmed processors with miles-long lines of milk trucks told farmers to start dumping milk.

“That is extremely depressing for a dairy farmer,” said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, a trade group that represents more than 900 farms in California. “It's a mind-numbing event. Our suicide hotline was tapped 86 times in 48 hours.”

Raudabaugh said the state’s dairy industry is relying on food banks to be a major customer, in part because they have refrigerated trucks and storage that solve farmers’ distribution woes. (She noted that processing costs and perishability concerns don’t make dairy a good candidate for the surplus Farm to Family program.)

“We’re providing many hundreds of percents more [to food banks] than pre-pandemic,” Raudabaugh said. “Some farmers would have lost their whole herd without these [partnerships]. It was significant to them to be able to stay in business.”

Cannon Michael, CEO of the Bowles Farming Company in the San Joaquin Valley, was sitting on a crop of onions and other produce but had lost many restaurant buyers. He worked with the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit started by college students to connect farmers and food banks.

“The money has to be there to justify the harvest,” Michael said, “and this solves some of that problem.”

Washington’s Work

On Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, Rachael Van Laanen’s small goat dairy, Mystery Bay Farms, lost half its sales overnight as farmers markets and restaurants closed. Van Laanen worked with nearby farmers to add her products to their online sales and direct-delivery programs, but the farm still lacked revenue.

Many farms in the region faced similar challenges, and the North Olympic Development Council quickly moved to help. Along with several partner organizations, the group raised about $70,000 this spring. They put that cash in farmers’ pockets, paying them up front for food the growers pledged to provide to local food banks over the next several years. Mystery Bay received $5,000.

“It's basically keeping my employees here. It's keeping me able to purchase labels, packaging, feed and diesel,” Van Laanen said. “It just has allowed me to keep buying everything I need to buy to keep producing.”

The farm expects to repay the money in about a year by donating roughly 200 pounds of cheese to local food banks.

Scott Chichester, who also received $5,000 for his small produce farm, said he’s already delivered enough salad mixes to food banks to pay off his contract. The food would not have otherwise had a market, he said, and the extra cash helped Chi’s Farm stay afloat.

“It was really timely,” Chichester said. “It helped me have the cash on hand to keep people employed and get food to the food banks in a critical early timeframe.”

Karen Affeld, the development group’s executive director, said benefactors were eager to keep local farmers in business, as the remote area is at the end of a fragile supply chain.

“Our retailers are still not getting everything they order, and there are shortages at local stores,” she said. “That brings home that we do need a local food economy. We don't want this to be a situation where we start to lose farms.”

State leaders also have bolstered such efforts. Just before the pandemic began to threaten the United States, Washington lawmakers budgeted $100,000 to boost the state’s Farm to Food Pantry Initiative, a program similar to California’s that launched in 2014.

It’s a partnership between the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Harvest Against Hunger, a Seattle-based nonprofit. With the new state funding and local donations, the program has significantly increased its food distribution, connecting 120 food banks with about 75 farmers.

By spending money early in the pandemic, the program gave farmers cash up front and allowed them to stay afloat, and now they’re harvesting crops bound for food banks.

“Many farmers have said that having these contracts really saved them this year,” said David Bobanick, the group’s executive director.

Bobanick noted that for every pound of food the partnership buys, another four pounds are donated by farmers.

“Once you establish that local connection, the farmers are very generous,” he said. “It's this symbiotic relationship where the farmers and hunger relief organizations are benefiting.”

The food is more nutritious than the meals food banks normally would be able to provide, he added.

Meanwhile, more than 100 farmers markets in Washington state have pledged to match purchases by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) this year, meaning every dollar in food stamps carries $2 in buying power for local produce, eggs, dairy and meat.

“Families are able to bring home so much more locally grown food, while also keeping more of their food dollars within our community,” said Amanda Milholland, director of the Jefferson County Farmers Markets.

Milholland said the markets’ food access programs serve 500 households annually, and she’s heard from parents who couldn’t otherwise afford healthy food for their kids and fixed-income seniors who use it to meet their food needs.

Making Connections

During the pandemic, many farmers have shifted to direct-to-customer sales, using models such as community-supported agriculture — known as CSA — in which subscribers regularly receive a box of produce straight from the farm. A few states are trying to help by launching online marketplaces to connect consumers with farms.

Massachusetts already had such a program, MassGrown. Traffic to the program’s website surged this spring as residents tried to avoid crowded supermarkets or find food that was out of stock.

“You can plug in your ZIP code and see who's selling maple syrup or tomatoes within X number of miles,” said John Lebeaux, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. “People are trying to access local food in an unprecedented way.”

The state will soon expand MassGrown with a business-to-business feature, allowing farmers to advertise and find services such as refrigeration and transportation. The state also poured $36 million into a food security grant program after the pandemic hit. The wide-ranging program has funded a half-million dollar expansion of a meat processing facility, provided small payouts to help farmers markets obtain cleaning supplies and helped a produce farm buy a refrigerated truck.

“We want to keep our farmers productive now, but we also want to boost their resiliency far into the future,” Lebeaux said. “Will people just go right back to the supermarket after the pandemic? We want them for the long haul.”

Amid the pandemic, Mississippi and South Carolina have launched their own online markets for farmers, designed much like classified ad pages. Both states said they were shocked at the traffic the pages received.

“We really did have an overwhelming response from our farmers and consumers,” said Paige Manning, director of marketing and public relations at the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. “One of the products people really seemed to be inquiring about was local meat. This gave those farmers another platform where they could sell.”

In South Carolina, CSAs and roadside markets have seen a surge in sales, said Eva Moore, communications director for the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state also has partnered with nonprofits to support a donor-based effort to raise $500,000 to pay farmers to supply food banks.

“If there’s one silver lining,” she said, “it’s that people are talking about local food, understanding where it comes from and in some cases laying eyes on the farmer who grows it in ways that they haven't before.”","And as millions of people lost their jobs, the state’s food banks needed to triple their food supply.

STARKVILLE, Miss.—The MSU Community Garden is kicking off its first official season today [Oct. 15], holding a ribbon cutting ceremony that also marks the beginning of Green Week on campus.

Administrators, faculty and students gathered to celebrate the garden’s opening, with Green Week activities including a stream clean-up, recycling sort, sustainability fair and more.

MSU President Mark E. Keenum discussed how the garden forwards the university’s mission of helping feed the world while serving as an illustration of the three pillars of the land-grant institution—learning, research and service.

“The MSU Community Garden exemplifies Mississippi State University’s commitment to solving one of the world’s greatest challenges—food insecurity,” Keenum said. “This garden will serve as a valuable resource for students, faculty and staff as they grow healthy food and conduct research and outreach, all of which will contribute to our overall efforts to eradicate hunger wherever it exists, whether that’s here at home in the local community or in communities around the world.”

A former Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Keenum has made global hunger a priority since returning to Mississippi State as president in 2009. Earlier this year, he was appointed chairman of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development. He also is chairman of the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research Board of Directors.

George Hopper, dean of MSU’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, emphasized during the ceremony the garden’s important role as a living classroom for MSU students.

“The MSU Community Garden provides an excellent opportunity for our students to be involved in food production at the local level. We are always looking for opportunities to train them and impart necessary life skills,” Hopper said. “This not only teaches valuable life lessons but encourages students to be ambassadors for agriculture locally, nationally and globally.”

Angi Elsea Bourgeois, dean and professor in MSU’s College of Architecture, Art and Design, said the garden gives students a chance to make a positive and lasting impact on the university community.

“This opportunity for cross-college collaboration creates a beautiful and meaningful impact on the Mississippi State community,” Bourgeois said. “Not only does the garden itself provide a place for students across campus to experience community while engaging in micro-gardening, it also provides our students in both CAAD and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences a chance to use their shared expertise in design to create a positive lasting mark for future students.”

Spearheaded by Cory Gallo, associate professor of landscape architecture, the garden is located adjacent to the EPA raingarden at the landscape architecture complex on Stone Boulevard. The garden includes eight accessible planters and 19 large raised planters. Approximately 50 students, faculty and staff were selected as the first gardeners earlier this fall on a first come, first served basis and now manage beds flush with a mix of fall produce.

Additionally, the space serves as an outdoor laboratory for sustainable/healthy food courses on campus and as a research site for the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station. The garden also includes two autonomous farming robots, or “Farmbots,” operated by the Students for Sustainable Campus organization. Each Farmbot maintains its own 5’ by 10’ bed. Two 2,000 gallon cisterns harvest rain water and condensation from a nearby air conditioning unit, and compost for use in the garden is collected from dining halls and Campus Landscape.

The garden is a cross-campus collaboration between several academic entities, two administrative units and three student organizations. Student organizations include MSU Student Association, MSU Graduate Student Association and Students for a Sustainable Campus. Academic units include the departments of Landscape Architecture; Plant and Soil Sciences; Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion; Art (graphic design concentration); Building Construction Science and the School of Architecture. Administrative units include the Office of Planning Design and Construction Administration and the Department of Health Promotion and Wellness. Additionally, MSU Facilities Management and the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station volunteered their time and expertise while the MSU Extension Service contributed funds.

About 13% of Americans, or 27.4 million people, reported they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat on a weekly basis, according to the latest Household Pulse Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 16. About 14 million households with children report not having enough to eat.

It's a situation lawmakers hope to improve. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a hunger crisis that has touched every part of our nation,"" Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry said in a statement Sunday. ""I am relieved that help is on the way and I look forward to continuing to do more in the new year to help Americans through this continuing crisis.""

Sunday's funding deal includes a 15% increase to the maximum SNAP benefits for six months through June 30, 2021, a move that many advocates were calling for. The increase amounts to a boost of about $25 per person each month.

The average SNAP benefit per person was $125 per month during the fiscal year 2020, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's about $1.39 per person per meal.

Roughly 6 to 7 million more people have applied and been approved for SNAP benefits since February, according to available data analyzed by CBPP. Nationally, that's about a 17% increase. About 25.3 million Americans total reported currently receiving SNAP benefits in the latest Census Household Pulse survey.

The latest relief package also expands SNAP eligibility to college students and excludes unemployment benefits from being counted as income when it comes to SNAP benefits. Additionally, U.S. territories including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa — which are not eligible for SNAP — will receive $614 million for nutrition grants.

The bill will also expand food access for children, including allowing any child under 6 to be deemed ""enrolled"" in child care and eligible for benefits under the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program. The program provides families with a voucher to purchase groceries to replace the breakfasts and lunches their children miss when schools and child-care centers are closed or only offering remote learning.

Congress reauthorized the program on Oct. 1, but it took the U.S. Department of Agriculture six weeks to establish the new guidelines for the program, meaning that states only started applying for funds this month.

Under the latest bipartisan deal, food banks also will receive $400 million in funding through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, will receive $175 million.

""Our network of member food banks across the country are witnessing unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for charitable food assistance,"" Kate Leone, Feeding America's chief government relations officer, said in a statement last week. ""Families are making impossible decisions between paying the rent and putting food on the table while food banks are working tirelessly to keep up with the increased need.""

The $13 billion in funding would provide ""limited but immediate help,"" Leone said, adding that more federal funding and assistance would likely be needed in the future. ""As always, and especially during this crisis, the simple truth is that charity alone cannot solve food insecurity.""

90,90,"Oct 1, 2020",HubcitySPOKES.com,Extra Table kicks off Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge to feed Mississippians,"With the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, Extra Table – a Hattiesburg nonprofit organization that works with a variety of food distributors and brokers to provide nutritious meals to food pantries around Mississippi – has scrapped its calendar of events for 2020 and replaced them with the Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge, a football-related fundraising competition designed to ensure Mississippians have food throughout the fall and into 2021.

The launch of the virtual fundraiser, which will feature various initiatives during the next two months, was announced Oct. 1 during a news conference at the University of Southern Mississippi.

“It’s something that we hoped to do four or five years ago, and finally this year, it came together,” Extra Table founder Robert St. John said. “People are very aware of hunger problems around Thanksgiving and Christmas, but people in this condition are just as hungry in July and September and October as they are in November and December.

“We raised a good bit of money over this last quarter, but we’re going to stretch that out to where these agencies that we serve don’t run out of food in June or July, when people are just as hungry then.”

During the Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge, which will end Thanksgiving weekend, participants can take place in a variety of events, including the The Yolks On You social media challenge. The Yolks On You, which is similar to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, challenges individuals to donate to Extra Table and crack an egg on their head after nominating three people to do the same on camera.

Participants are asked to upload their video to social media and tag Extra Table in their posts.

“Get ready for that,” said Rhonda Hayden, director of development at Extra Table. “We’re going to need lots of people to do videos with their friends and family, and post it on Facebook and tag Extra Table.”

There’s also Helmets for Hunger, in which eight famous Mississippi artists will decorate helmets for an upcoming silent auction, and a Text to Give Campaign that will allow participants to donate on the Tackle Hunger website. Every dollar donated will count toward the participant’s favorite college football team in Mississippi.

Another initiative is Real Men Tackle Hunger, in which a group of 25 professional men across the state will conduct their own fundraising for Extra Table.

“That will take place on social media platforms and individual letters to their friends and family,” Hayden said. “As a part of this distinguished group of community leaders, the Real Men Tackling Hunger are not only raising funds for Extra Table’s statewide feeding efforts, but raising awareness of food insecurity in our state.”

Extra Table also will work with Stokes Distributing and Coca-Cola to set up tear sheets for $1 at convenience stores, grocery stores and other businesses statewide. The organizations will donate a small percentage of sales from Coca-Cola case products that are bought during October and November. The tear sheets will be in the shape of a football and feature Extra Table’s logo, and purchasers will be asked to write their name on the football for display in the store.

“We chose the price point of one dollar, since one dollar provides 5.9 healthy meals,” Hayden said. “So no matter how small your donation to Extra Table may be, it will feed our hungry neighbors in Mississippi and make a positive impact on the fight against hunger.”

Anyone interested in taking part in the Tackle Hunger Giving challenge can visit www.extratable.org or visit any of the organization’s social media platforms.

“We are looking to make this an annual event,” Hayden said. “I think the partners that we have in place for this first year are really rooting for us to take this on an annual basis.”

Fifteen college athletic programs across the state – including Southern Miss, Mississippi State University and Ole Miss – will challenge fans, staff, faculty, alumni and students to raise money during the Tackle Hunger Giving Challenge. A grand trophy will be given to the fanbase that raises the most funds.

“It started out as kind of a rivalry thing between Mississippi State and Ole Miss, and then other people brought USM in,” St. John said. “Then others kind of heard about it and started hopping on the bandwagon, so now we have 15 college athletic programs that are going to join in. It’s a good competition for a great cause.”

The First – A National Banking Association will serve as the title sponsor for the fundraiser, while the Mapp Family Foundation will serve as the match sponsor.

“Of course, we’re headquartered here, and as we’ve grown to Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia, we definitely realized Hattiesburg is home, and even the state of Mississippi is home,” said Jerome Brown, executive vice president at The First – A National Banking Association. “So us taking care of home is always important.

“When we think about tackling hunger and combining it with football, it’s just a win-win for everyone. We’re privileged to be a part of this.”","“It’s something that we hoped to do four or five years ago, and finally this year, it came together,” Extra Table founder Robert St. John said.

93,93,"Sep 27, 2020",Arkansas Online,Pandemic has fewer kids getting meals at schools,"In a state where many children didn't get enough to eat before the pandemic, changes to kindergarten-through-12th-grade education threaten to widen the hunger divide.

Participation in school meal programs -- a linchpin in children's nutrition, especially for those who get free or reduced-price lunches -- has dropped in many districts around the state this fall, administrators say.

That's true even though most districts opted in on a federal program that allows all students to eat at no out-of-pocket costs through December.

More than half of Arkansas' schoolchildren are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, so missed lunches and breakfasts indicate potential gaps in access to food as schools move to feed the kids in new ways. Missed meals are also troubling indicators, experts say, amid an upswing in nationwide food insecurity tied to this year's economic recession.

In Arkansas and elsewhere, the recession-tied burden weighs most heavily on Black, Hispanic and other children of color and their families, experts and advocates say.

""Anywhere there's a hungry child, I can guarantee you there's an entire hungry family"" because parents will go without to make sure their kids are fed, said Arkansas Food Bank Chief Executive Officer Rhonda Sanders. ""I think most people tend to forget that.""

Since schools reopened in August, just a fraction of families who chose to have their children attend classes virtually are going to school to pick up breakfasts and lunches, officials say. Also, the number of students getting their meals in school cafeterias is down, attributed to safety fears unassuaged by extra cleaning and food-packaging measures.

In the Pocahontas School District, about 300 students chose all-virtual learning this fall, and child nutrition director Patty Moore said she is sending food home for approximately 30 of them each week. That can mean the district will receive less in reimbursements for meals served, she said, and saddle families with the extra food costs.

Even if families in the area are among a recent surge in state applicants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) -- a successor to the food stamp program -- ""I know it's costing more for them to [feed kids at home] than if their kids come to school and eat,"" Moore said.

The same situation is evident among remote learners in the Fort Smith and North Little Rock school districts. In the latter, a spokesman estimated that fewer than 25% of the district's virtual learners are going to schools to get their meals, and acknowledged that ""transportation might be an issue.""

The Arkansas Department of Education isn't tracking specific data on meals distributed to virtual learners, but the agency's Child Nutrition Unit has fielded calls from administrators concerned about meal participation this school year, spokeswoman Kim Mundell wrote in an email.

Accounts from districts overall point to children eating less frequently at school and having less access to food since the spring pandemic community lockdowns.

In May, one national survey found that four in 10 adults with children eligible for free and reduced-price lunches weren't getting replacement assistance, said food insecurity expert Elaine Waxman.

Across the country, news reports this summer documented long lines of cars and unprecedented demand at food banks as millions of people lost jobs and businesses closed because of the pandemic.

Waxman, who is a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank The Urban Institute, said this fall's reports of fewer children eating school-provided meals ""doesn't surprise"" her and ""is probably not an indication that families don't need the help -- just that the logistics may work against participation.""

Jeremy Everett, founder and executive director of the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, said he has heard a few similar concerns about lower school meals participation, though it's not enough to know if the situation is nationwide.

""Many of the children are at home alone while their parents work and are unable to leave to go get their meals,"" he said in an email.

""It seems that the primary barrier is transportation. Children and parents are having a difficult time getting to the meals to pick them up when available, and schools do not have the capacity to make home deliveries.""

The end of many coronavirus relief programs, such as the weekly $600 unemployment insurance supplement that expired in July, coupled with sporadic or skipped meals offered through schools undermine efforts to keep kids from going hungry.

Those efforts, which experts and officials view as successful, include many districts opting in on a U.S. Department of Agriculture waiver that allows districts to serve children free lunches even if the family's income is higher than the usually limit. The program will cover about $80 million in costs through December, state Education Secretary Johnny Key said at a Sept. 2 media briefing.

The initiative will reduce administrative burdens at schools, as well as worry for families who ""might not qualify for free meals, but are still going through a tough time,"" Key said.

Melanie Hyso, 42, of Bentonville said efforts by state and federal governments this year helped her feed her 16-year-old, 12-year-old and 7-year-old. She praised the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) assistance program, which federal legislation created in March. It offered $319 per child for families eligible for free or reduced-price lunches because schools had closed.

Hyso said she's ""so grateful' for the assistance card, which arrived later than she'd expected, during the costly run-up to the fall semester.

""You're trying to get supplies, and clothes, and shoes, and all this stuff, and I'm like, 'oh my god, where is it?'"" she said.

While schools were shut down in the spring and summer, her district delivered basic meals -- corn dogs, sandwiches, vegetable sticks -- to the family's house. Her son's mentor and a therapist sometimes chipped in to help, at one point dropping off a birthday cake, she said.

All of it, she said, helped during a period of budgets strained by the kids spending more time at home, using more electricity to run their learning devices or eating lunch at home rather than at school.

""We've gotten really good at getting creative,"" she said.

'GRAB AND GO'

Declining participation in school meal programs is the most recent challenge in feeding kids during a year administrators say is out of the ordinary and stressful, and began with the abrupt closure of schools in the state in mid-March.

The closures presented a challenge for districts trying to feed thousands of children who were no longer going to school every day, especially kids who rely on free and reduced-price school lunches and breakfasts.

That's the majority of Arkansas schoolchildren, state Department of Education data show. Of 263 districts and charter schools in Arkansas, 223 had more than half of their students participate in those meals programs in the 2019-20 school year. The Marvell-Elaine School District and the Helena/West Helena School District have more than 95% of students enrolled in meals programs.

Ally Mrachek, child nutrition director for Fayetteville Public Schools, said she ""kind of saw the writing on the wall"" and began planning before schools closed last spring, but she called the experience ""surreal"" nonetheless.

""We saw other districts across the country closing, and we weren't getting a lot of communication in our state,"" she said. ""We were driving forklifts and box trucks, and really trying to move food as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.""

By March 20, the USDA relaxed several of its rules on school nutrition programs, including those pertaining to eating in group settings, what time children must eat and prohibitions on parents picking up food.

Food banks in the state also joined in, packing emergency boxes, connecting children with commodities programs and distributing ""farm to family"" food boxes.

Common strategies for districts included facilitating meal pickup hours for families and delivering meals to community drop points or neighborhoods, officials said. But there were challenges.

For example, El Dorado School District workers packed some lunches not knowing whether families had access to refrigeration or freezers at home, said Kim Newman, the district's child nutrition director.

By summer, more rule modifications, extensions of waivers and an existing districtwide free student meals program allowed the food providers to drive into neighborhoods and feed any child they saw, she said.

""We would just roll down the windows and say, 'Hey, are you hungry? Want some lunch?'"" Newman said.

Summer food programs adapted menus to better ensure food safety, including ""more sandwich-type meals,"" because food has to be served at a certain temperature, said Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education Director Tonya Williams. She said programs for young kids shifted similarly, offering ""grab and go"" meals, though most of those programs now have reverted to their normal format.

""We're seeing a lot of people go back to work and have to be somewhere, so there's less of a need for 'grab and go' options,"" she said.

NO QUICK FIX

Food insecurity -- largely a measure of economic struggles -- is different from hunger. It means not consistently having enough money to buy food. For example, a woman who is food insecure might run out of money to buy food before payday and have to change her eating habits or cut out a meal.

It's long been a problem in Arkansas, a state with many low-income households. In 2018, the state had the nation's second-highest rate of food insecurity, behind only Mississippi, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Feeding America. The group operates six food banks in Arkansas.

Food insecurity is expected to increase this year because of the pandemic, a group of researchers from that organization found. Researchers project food insecurity rates will increase by 50% or more in Benton, Washington, Saline, Carroll, Lonoke and Faulkner counties, and grow at least 24% in every county in the state.

Experts say it can take years for a family to recover from a period of food insecurity -- similar to what was seen during the recession in 2008, when it took between seven and 10 years for households to recover.

The pandemic has thrown more than 10 million kids, whose families struggle with access to food, in turmoil this year, said Crystal FitzSimons, director of school and out-of-school programs at the Washington, D.C.,-based Food Research and Action Center.

Normally in times of economic shocks like job loss, a parent can sign up through schools for food assistance programs for their kids, but the pandemic upended that.

""We had a hunger crisis before the pandemic, and the pandemic just made it worse,"" she said. ""This was a situation where, overnight, communities had to try to figure out how to set up these feeding programs.""

Early responses from communities and the government drew praise from advocates. Those responses included boosts in unemployment benefits as facilitated by the federal Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act; $1,200 payments to many Americans; the P-EBT aid program; and relying on distribution frameworks in existing summer food programs.

The federal government also briefly bumped up SNAP payments and waived several requirements around the program to make it easier for people to enroll, said Mary Franklin, Division of County Operations Director, which oversees the program in Arkansas.

But experts expressed concern about some limits in the response, including stalled negotiations in Congress regarding a new coronavirus relief package. Also, continued funding for the P-EBT program depends on the passage of a congressional spending bill that cleared the House on Tuesday.

In this year's unprecedented crisis, families also may encounter complex problems. For example, mixed-immigration-status families might not apply for pandemic aid that they're entitled to, fearing that it might affect their future citizenship applications, the Urban Institute's Waxman said.

""If you're already vulnerable, then the pandemic is just layered on that,"" she said.

State data bears out the rising need, with nearly 10,000 more households enrolled in SNAP in August than in April. Food banks across the state also are ""seeing increases"" in people seeking help, and a rise in food insecurity is expected, said Sanders, the food bank CEO.

""It's not going to just automatically drop back to where it was. There's too many jobs that have been lost; there's too many dollars that have been pulled out of the economy,"" she said.

FUTURE WORRIES

School lunch and breakfast programs can significantly ease a family's food budget by providing as many as 10 meals a week (and sometimes more for very low-income families) -- which is why a decline in their use is viewed as worrisome.

The goal is for children to lead healthy, productive lives, and ""that's impossible"" if they're hungry, said Melvin Clayton, race equity director for advocacy at Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. Experts link growing up in a food-insecure household with later-in-life health challenges, such as cognitive delays, asthma and other chronic illnesses.

Several Arkansas school districts -- including the large Benton, Bentonville, Fayetteville and Cabot districts -- are in counties where food insecurity is projected to increase the most while also seeing historically low rates of free and reduced-price lunch participation, suggesting a gap between what's happened in the past and what may be needed.

This year, the Education Department's child nutrition unit has recommended that schools develop community partnerships to help connect virtually-educated students with meals, and review and revise distribution plans if participation is low. Some districts have experimented with food pickup times, moving to once-weekly or evening pickups.

Meal distribution is ""costly,"" the Department of Education spokeswoman said, and there are no USDA funds available to help districts shoulder it.

The Arkansas Food Bank is establishing a handful of on-campus food pantries at schools around the state in a pilot program, and Sanders said it has prepared to shift back to assembling emergency food boxes quickly in case schools are forced to close on a large scale again.

Beyond schools, advocates support the extension and expansion of relief programs, encouraging less restrictive rules and urging community leaders to speak out against the perceived stigma of people using those programs. One rule that should be waived, they say, is Arkansas' ""asset limit"" of $2,250 on hand to qualify for SNAP aid.

For students attending school in person and eating on campus, much is changed in cafeterias and classrooms because of the pandemic. There are physical distancing measures, staggered lunch hours, and changes in how students handle food and condiments. Disposable utensils, dishes and cups are being used, but that also increases schools' costs and trash.

Across districts, food being sent home -- sometimes because of students suddenly being sent into quarantine -- is usually straightforward and child-friendly. Meal options include chicken nuggets or spaghetti with meat sauce for lunch, and cereal or string cheese for breakfast.

School officials say there's some uncertainty about what the rest of the school year will look like.

Mrachek, the Fayetteville director, said that's prompted her to try to sign up as many families as possible for free and reduced-price meals for the spring semester, even families that may not have used such programs in the past. Toward that end, the district created videos in English and Spanish to explain the applications, which schools must submit by Oct. 1.

""Families won't rebound as fast as that cutoff date [in December for USDA waiver programs]. I don't know if families will be back on their feet by then,"" she said.

95,95,"Mar 26, 2018",The Commercial Dispatch,‘The hungriest state in the nation’,"No state grapples with hunger, proportionally, as much as Mississippi, according to Mississippi Food Network CEO Charles Beady.

In fact, 20.8 percent of households in Mississippi are at risk of hunger, he said. That’s the highest, percentage-wise, in the country.

Beady, speaking Friday at Mississippi State University as the featured guest for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences’ Charles E. Lindley Lecture series, said the Mississippi Food Network is working with agencies across Mississippi to try to combat the state’s hunger issues. The Mississippi Food Network is the state’s only food bank associated with Feeding America, a nation-wide network of more than 200 food bank locations in almost every state.

The network has an 80,000 square foot facility in Jackson. Last year, Beady said, the Mississippi Food Network delivered more than 21.4 million pounds of food through the roughly 430 member agencies, such as churches, food pantries and other organizations that help in its mission.

While the work is impressive, it pales in comparison to some other food banks in the Feeding America Network that Beady highlighted during his talk.

For example, he said a food bank in Houston, Texas is 308,000 square feet, distributed 96 million pounds of food last year, employs about 180 people and had a $27 million budget last year.

Texas also has 16 food banks, according to a map on the Feeding America website, while Mississippi just has one.

“I’m trying to give you a comparison here,” Beady said. “We’re in a low-resource state. We’ve got $3.6 million. We’ve got 29 people who work for us. We’ve got two tractor trailers — a 24-footer and a 14-footer — that we distribute food through.”

Mississippi’s limited resources can present a problem, especially when coupled with the state’s high food insecurity. Food insecurity, Beady said, happens when someone doesn’t know when or how they’ll get their next meal.

He said that’s compounded by widespread food deserts across Mississippi. Beady said that U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food deserts as areas with a poverty rate higher than 30 percent and more than a third of the population living more than a mile from the nearest grocery store.

Food deserts are peppered across the state, according to a map based on USDA data that Beady presented during his lecture, which included southern Oktibbeha County, west and central Clay county and western Lowndes County. Almost all of Noxubee County, save Macon, is a food desert, according to the map.

“Nearly 600,000 people live in food deserts in Mississippi,” Beady said. “Food deserts don’t just exist in the Mississippi Delta. A lot of people think food deserts are in the Mississippi Delta. There are 19 census tracts in Jackson, Mississippi, our state capital, that are identified as food deserts.”

During a question-and-answer session, Beady also pointed out Mississippi’s hunger problems have, paradoxically, contributed to it being the fattest state in the nation. He said part of that is because people eat a lot of junk food, which is cheap, but unhealthy.

Helen Beady, Charles’ wife, who works with the American Heart Association, said where people live can also play a big role in their health.

“When you start to talk about food insecurity, it’s the conditions in which an individual lives,” she said. “I am from the Delta, and certainly we know that we’re the most food insecure. …ZIP codes, matter, but there’s social determinates for health. Health is where you live, where you work, where you play, where you raise your family and all that.”

Beady said hunger takes a lot of forms, but the Mississippi Food Network does what it can to combat it.

“Hunger in Mississippi has many faces,” Beady said. “Seniors, the young, struggling mothers, mothers-to-be. They’re white. They’re black. You don’t have to be poor in the traditional sense of being poor to not know how or when you might get you next meal. Losing a spouse, losing a job can put you in a situation where you need help, and that’s all part and parcel of why we exist at the Mississippi Food Network.”","No state grapples with hunger, proportionally, as much as Mississippi, according to Mississippi Food Network CEO Charles Beady.

97,97,"Sep 1, 2020",talkbusiness.net,Data confirms Delta region one of the hardest hit by COVID-19,"Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. One region, often cited as the most impoverished in the country according to economic metrics, the Mississippi Delta Region, has been hit particularly hard, according to data collected by the Delta Grassroots Caucus.

“The Delta continues to suffer seriously from the pandemic and a strong recovery is still not here. A collection of data from across the region indicate the need for a strong economic stimulus from federal, state and private sector sources. An overly rosy depiction of the Delta’s economy is counterproductive because we need to admit we still have a severe problem in order to solve it,” said Lee Powell, Caucus director.

Four of the top counties in Arkansas in terms of high unemployment include Chicot (13.6%), Mississippi (12.6%), Phlllips (11.8%) and Crittenden (11.6%). Craighead County (7.7%) remained the lone bright spot in terms of economic metrics in the region.

Other key findings from the compilation include:

Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana had the four highest rates of food insecurity based on a Feeding America survey. The Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research found the highest food insecurity levels were in Mississippi (31.6%) and Louisiana (30.1%), with Arkansas the fifth highest at 25.9%.

A survey of the University of Arkansas Department of Sociology and Criminology found that Arkansas and other Southern and mid-Southern states had elevated levels of food insecurity due to COVID-19. In the category of “reduced quality, desirability or variety of diet,” the four worst rates were all from “Greater Delta Region” states: Alabama (47.7%), Arkansas (47.4%), Tennessee (45.1%) and Kentucky (44%).

A University of Louisiana at Lafayette report found that job losses in Louisiana were virtually twice as high in the pandemic as compared with after Hurricane Katrina – by 11% in the first half of this year, as compared with a 6% drop after Katrina in 2005. Louisiana’s gross domestic product contraction of 6% was one of the five sharpest drops among all states.

An Illinois Municipal League survey found that 87% of municipalities expected a substantial revenue shortfall due to the pandemic. Many communities advised that they will need greater assistance from federal and state governments. The Southern Illinois Delta area chronically fares worse than the statewide economic figures for Illinois.

ALREADY VULNERABLE

The Delta economy was vulnerable due to many small businesses that were struggling even before the pandemic. Many have closed or have not come back yet, and many low-income people who did not have large savings to see them through a downturn are struggling financially, the data reflects.

The region’s diverse population with many African Americans and some other minorities has been hit harder by both higher virus infection rates and more economic losses, with minority women being especially hard hit because women suffered the largest job losses and as minorities they have higher virus infection rates; and the region’s economy had major manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors that have been hit disproportionately by the recession.

Harvey Joe Sanner, president of American Ag Movement of Arkansas in Des Arc, said “the situation is bleak.”

“Our job situation is worsening. as one of our large employers in Lonoke, Remmington Arms is laying off workers… I think most people feel that our situation, both health-wise and economically, will get worse before it gets better,” Sanner said.

Millie Atkins, Delta Caucus senior adviser and veteran Delta regional advocate based in Monroe, La., said the organization will seek federal relief.

“This pandemic has shed a great light on the many economic, social and educational inequities in a number of areas where the Delta was vulnerable such as the large number of job losses, the many low-income jobs that made it difficult for people to accumulate savings that could see them through a downturn, the small business closures that have not come back yet,” she said.

Powell said the Delta Grassroots Caucus will advocate for a continuing strong stimulus package at the annual Delta conference on Oct. 13-14, 2020, which will largely be conducted by Zoom webinar due to the coronavirus. Delta Caucus partners across the region are calling for a strong economic stimulus and safety net package to jump-start the region’s economy. Suggestions for a policy package include continuing larger unemployment benefits and strong federal and state economic stimulus packages to deal with unprecedented job losses.

The Caucus will seek a 15% increase in SNAP and other nutrition benefit programs during the pandemic – although SNAP is primarily an anti-hunger program, it also has an economic stimulus impact, with every $1 spent on SNAP generating $1.70 in economic benefits. The Caucus will ask for a major infrastructure expansion program to create jobs, repair deteriorating infrastructure, and stimulate the economy.

The Caucus will seek funding for Job creation and retention programs through tax incentives for investing in economically distressed areas. It will ask for maintaining education and workforce development programs during the pandemic, which will require a major broadband access expansion initiative through programs such as USDA’s Rural Re-Connect high-speed broadband program and state programs like Arkansas’ Rural Connect (ARC).","Economic devastation has gripped through every geographic region in the U.S. and every economic sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The historic Covid-19 pandemic has created an increased need for donations to The University of Southern Mississippi’s Eagle’s Nest food pantry located on the Hattiesburg campus.

In response to that dilemma, a trio of University organizations – Sigma Alpha Lambda, Association of Office Professionals and Staff Council – united to generate awareness of the pantry’s plight. Over the past several months, the groups have become directly involved in collecting and delivering contributions for the pantry.

“We could not have maintained the pantry operations without the assistance of these organizations,” said Eagle’s Nest Adviser Dr. Tamara Hurst, associate professor in USM’s School of Social Work. “They worked with us throughout the summer and into the fall. Members worked in the pantry and delivered food to students who were unable to come to campus. The pantry relies on community support and volunteers to stay open. It means everything to us to receive this support.”

Located in the basement of The Hub on the Hattiesburg campus, The Eagle’s Nest provides food, hygiene items, school supplies and other assorted products to students and staff. Only a current Southern Miss identification card is needed to access the pantry.

Hurst notes that the pantry’s primary needs include shelf-stable items such as dried or canned beans, rice, fruits, vegetables and meats.

“We always welcome fresh fruits, vegetables and bread,” said Hurst. “Gently-used cookware and eating utensils are always in demand, particularly with student in off-campus apartments.”

Since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted across the country in March, the Eagle’s Nest has experienced an increased demand from staff and international students, in particular. Jennifer Lewis, Assistant Director of Compliance and Ethics at USM, serves as the Vice President for Community Service for Sigma Alpha Lambda. She is also an Eagle’s Nest board member. Lewis says the relentless pandemic has produced immense strain on charity venues such as the Eagle’s Nest.

“In these unprecedented times, we are concerned that our most vulnerable populations, i.e. some of our staff whose spouses may not have been able to return to work or missed work during earlier quarantine phases are playing catch-up and our students, especially our international students who cannot work off-campus continue to suffer from food insecurity due to the period of time during which they were not able to work on campus,” said Lewis.

Cain, who is a prison case manager, has been working tirelessly through the epidemic, taking time off only to grieve a personal COVID loss. She spoke to ELLE.com about what the need looks like up close, taking shame out of the equation, and working through the uncertainty of the pandemic.

We've been involved in helping the community and involved with the Feeding America program since, I believe, 2004. My husband, who is deceased now, and I learned about it through the Veterans programs that were doing food programs at that time. We got interested, and worked with our board in order to do it for our church.

It's been good ever since that time. We've been working together, raising funds and helping the community—it's just something that we like doing. We have this slogan, ""It's in our hearts."" We have great support with the Mississippi Food Network, the Feeding America food bank. We've been working with them for a long time, they provide us with professional and courteous service.

""We all go through things in one time or the other.""

We all go through things in one time or the other. During this COVID period, we all need a little bit more of a helping hand because so many people are losing their jobs. We do have a few more calls, and a few more people just show up. We assist them during this time without question. We don't need to be questioning peoples' needs—we try to assist as much as we can, when we can. We continue to raise funds on our own to add to whatever we acquire from the food bank. And we've tried, on our own, to raise funds to get more. We do well, and our community works with us, which enables us to move forward.

We try to stay open periodically during the day, a couple of hours. We have great assistants, a great volunteer group of people that help us out and keep the food bank open on specific hours and days. My phone number is available. If people contact us, we will go open it at any time. Most available times are from eight to five. If it's after five o'clock, they know they can call me. Sometimes the staff will even deliver foods.

We have first-time people come in, we introduce to them what we're about, and then we introduce the process on how we handle the food, and the application process if they want to continue. Most of them do come back and complete the application process. Sometimes they refer others to come to us for assistance, and the process continues. We talk to our people, and we work with our people in a good way, I feel. Conversation is always good, it puts people's minds at ease.

Our busiest period was April through June. We started to slow down a little bit in July. I think we are stable right now. In August we’d serve over 200 in a week. When we get extra food, we can serve over 300 to 400 a week and also help our neighboring pantries.

""We all had deaths in our families because of COVID, but we continued to serve.""

During the high point, we all were very, very concerned, and we had to live by the Food Network (COVID-19) rules of social distance and wearing masks. Because we had to be protective of our families and protective of their families. We all were very concerned, it was iffy. We just followed those guidelines and everything went well. Although myself, our volunteers and my staff, we all had deaths in our families because of COVID, we continued to serve.

We still continue to serve the community. We had to slow down a little bit for a while there when we did have the deaths in our family—we had problems, too. But we made sure that our people were taken care of, made sure that at the end of the day we had enough or could refer them to other pantries.

Courtesy Feeding America

During this process, people talk about the loss of their jobs or problems, having enough to pay their bills. They encourage us because they'll tell us many times that the food that they get from us helps a long ways. We are all appreciative—when people say things like that it motivates you to continue to serve. My family and volunteers that assist, they do not waver. Even though we all are scared of this COVID, they do not waver. We all continue to work with the Network to assist the public.

What I’ve found is that it's a good feeling to help. When a family comes to a food bank it's a necessity. If we have it, they have it, too. We are in this together, and we will work together to help each other.

As told to Adrienne Gaffney.

OXFORD, Miss. – As physical distancing to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has transformed the way that Mississippians go to school, do business and care for their neighbors, the North Mississippi VISTA Project is seeking applicants to join efforts to fight poverty in Mississippi through national service.

The North Mississippi VISTA Project has positions for full-time service for summer and yearlong terms of service beginning in June 2020. VISTA members join nonprofit organizations and Title I school districts to support educational attainment, economic opportunity and healthy lifestyles.

While the country practices physical distancing, VISTA members are permitted to support the mission of their host sites through teleservice.

“Already we have seen members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project come forward to support relief efforts in the face of COVID-19,” said Emily Echols, project manager with the University of Mississippi‘s McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement, which leads the North Mississippi VISTA Project.

“From fundraising campaigns to offset the loss of income to working with school districts to deliver school lunches to students living in isolated areas, VISTA members are making a difference for those most at risk of suffering income loss and food insecurity.”

Natural disasters and crises throw the most vulnerable members of society into even more precarious situations. Disparities in income, health status and access to healthy food become more pronounced in emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In such unprecedented times, efforts to alleviate poverty, empower communities and create sustainable solutions are more urgent than ever.

“While VISTA members make a difference at their host sites by increasing the reach of the organization, collectively all members of the North Mississippi VISTA Project are building a better Mississippi,” said Adriana Cooper, VISTA leader. “My time as a VISTA member has permitted me to develop my professional skills while serving my community.”

The North Mississippi VISTA Project needs applicants for summer and full-year terms of service. VISTA summer associates complete 300 hours of direct service to promote literacy and food security over the summer. VISTA members serving yearlong terms help host site organizations by writing grants, developing programs, conducting outreach, managing volunteers and strengthening partnerships.

All VISTA members receive a living allowance of approximately $950 per month and can select either an end-of-service education award of $6,195 ($1,311 for summer associates) or a cash stipend of $1,800 ($311 for summer associates). Members serving a yearlong term also are eligible for a health benefit, a child care benefit and a housing stipend, if offered by their host sites.

“The North Mississippi VISTA Project is central to the McLean Institute’s mission to fight poverty through education in Mississippi,” said Albert Nylander, McLean Institute director and professor of sociology. “Our work is needed now more than ever.”

102,102,"Jun 29, 2020",National Hog Farmer,"CAST releases report on COVID-19 impact on food, agricultural markets","The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology and the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association have partnered together on a new paper, Economic Impacts of COVID-19 on Food and Agricultural Markets. This publication contains insights from 31 experts and is now available for download.

COVID-19 disrupted nations around the world in 2020. People have had to alter their typical lifestyle, and the measures put into effect to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have had an immense impact on economic activity, employment, food consumption and workplace environments.

The paper's authors discuss the following topics: macroeconomics, trade, supply chain, consumer behavior, food service/grocery, meat processing, forestry and wood products, local food systems, food waste, food insecurity, major commodity crops, agricultural finance, agricultural labor, rural health care, and research and outreach priorities.

Keith Coble, the department head for agricultural economics at Mississippi State University, says, ""Between food producers and consumers lies a complex and often-ignored food supply chain. It is ignored in part because it has consistently provided safe and plentiful food supplies."" Most of the time people's attention is on food-borne illnesses instead of looking at shutdowns that could affect the labor supply.

""The COVID-19 crisis has also shown us the danger of disregarding scientific knowledge. There is a need to reassess the regulation of new technologies in the United States and globally,"" says David Zilberman, a professor in the agricultural and resource economics department at the University of California, Berkeley.

Many countries shut down large segments of their economies, with most employees working remotely if possible. Doing so ""led to a sharp and significant loss in gross domestic product and a rapid rise in unemployment and underemployment,"" says Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Georgia. ""The challenge is to restore as much economic activity as possible while maintaining some measure of control and mitigation of the novel coronavirus.""

103,103,"Oct 6, 2020",NBC News,This is what hunger looks like in COVID-19 America,"Corina Martinez never expected to find herself in a food bank line.

As a customer service representative for a financial institution in El Paso, Texas, Martinez is usually able to feed her three kids with the help of free school meals. But when the government shut down schools in March as a result of COVID-19, she was out of options.

“It’s terrible to say this, but before, I used to think ‘Oh my God, going to a food bank is so embarrassing, I’m not going,” Martinez, 34, said in an interview with Know Your Value. “Now, I just go.”

These days, Martinez pops over to the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Food Bank when she can. She waits in line in her car, and when it’s her turn, she browses the shelves and takes home a cart full of fresh and nutritious food. It has been a lifesaver during the global pandemic.

“You might see someone and not think that person needs it, but they might really need it,” said Martinez, who lives with her husband Edgar, who works as a delivery driver, and her kids who are 2, 13, and 15 years old. “When you really need help, it completely changes everything.”

A national hunger crisis.

Martinez is far from alone. Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, the line for the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger food bank has grown up to four miles long, according to the bank’s CEO Susan E. Goodell. By June, food distribution from the bank shot up 569 percent year-over-year.

Nationally, an analysis from Feeding America projected that food insecurity will hit 52 million people due to COVID-19, which is an increase of 17 million people from pre-pandemic times. Between March and June, it is estimated that four in 10 visitors to food banks are in need due to COVID-19-related reasons, such as school shutdowns or job loss.

“It’s an economic tradeoff,” said Feeding America’s COO Katie Fitzgerald. “You’ll pay for medicine, rent, your mortgage and your car so you can get to your job before you buy your groceries. People don’t have enough money for the food they need, so they skip meals or eat unhealthy food that’s a lot cheaper. This is what food insecurity looks like in America.”

The severity of the problem varies by state, with Mississippi facing the highest rate of projected food insecurity in 2020. Texas has the highest rate of food insecurity among minors, with 2.3 million children facing hunger in the state.

According to the Center for American Progress, women and people of color have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic across the country. Single-mother households are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience food insecurity than other households, according to Feeding America.

Struggling to keep up with demand.

Food banks are working around the clock to keep up with demand. El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, for example, is seeing an all-time low in volunteers, while donor and government funding can be unpredictable.

“It’s a constant effort to figure out how to feed 138,000 a day,” Goodell said. “We have to be very creative. It’s incredibly stressful when you come to work, and you see miles of cars of people waiting for food and you only have one-and-a-half days [worth] in the food bank.”

Food banks comply with social distancing regulations, which has led to residual issues like social isolation, according to Andrea Johnson, assistant director of the High Plains Food Bank which serves agencies along the Texas Panhandle. Many people, especially seniors, depended on the pre-pandemic food bank to express their needs verbally and interact with other people, she said. The bank also had to eliminate critical community outreach, like nutrition education classes.

“With the grab-and-go drive thru, there’s a part of the human component that we’re missing,” Johnson said.

The future looks grim. Food insecurity will not disappear once the economy recovers, Fitzgerald said. After the 2008 recession, it took about 10 years for food insecurity to drop to pre-2008 levels, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Now, the levels are climbing back up.

“Food insecurity tends to lag behind economic improvements,” said Fitzgerald. “We’re deep in responding to the needs today. But even as the economy recovers, there will be long-term elevated food insecurity until families get on their feet. It doesn’t happen overnight.”

A change in mindset toward hunger.

To help, Americans need to volunteer at their local food banks and donate whatever they can, said Goodell.

Further, the stigma surrounding aid-seekers needs to be eliminated.

“I’ve had to have kind and gentle debates with people who say that people are taking advantage of the system,” Johnson said. “Of course, we’re going to have people take advantage, but right now, we’ve got families of five who can only manage a part-time job.”

Today, Gleaners continues to host 70 sites throughout our five-county service area, averaging an attendance of 255 households per site. A site above in Detroit, Michigan. Feeding America

The shame trickles down to people who actually need help, said Fitzgerald. Often, they feel like they’ve done something wrong when they’re actually victims of a crisis.

“I’ll never forget a man who lost his job in his 50s and couldn’t look me in the eye, because he used to be a donor and he couldn’t imagine needing a go to a food bank,” Fitzgerald said. “That shame is just because in America, prior to the pandemic, we faulted the person for doing something wrong. I do hope that’s changing. Food insecurity is not something that people deserve.”

Martinez advised people to ask for help without feeling embarrassed.

“Don’t be ashamed. Everybody needs that extra help once in a while,” she said. “It’s there for a reason. It’s there to help.”","These days, Martinez pops over to the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Food Bank when she can.

104,104,"Jan 13, 2020",,Bully’s Closet and Pantry aims to meet several needs at MSU,"STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.

“We’re going to get more on Monday,” Clarke said. “You’re fine.”

All the milk was gone by Friday evening at Bully’s Closet and Pantry, a one-stop shop for food, professional clothing, school supplies and hygiene products for Mississippi State University students. It opened with a ribbon-cutting Friday morning and started distributing supplies that afternoon.

The shelves were lined with canned fruits and vegetables, beans and soup, boxes of cereal, Kleenex, personal items such as razors and deodorant and much more. Frozen meals and perishables such as milk and eggs were kept in the freezer and fridge, with a list on a white board keeping track of them.

School supplies such as pens and notebooks fill another set of shelves, and the next room in the small Morgan Avenue building contains racks lined with professional clothing, including blazers, for students to use as needed for job interviews. The building was formerly used for faculty housing, and BCP acquired the space in September 2018.

About 30 percent of college students nationwide struggle with food insecurity, so BCP will serve as “one more layer of support” for those students, MSU Vice President of Student Affairs Regina Hyatt told The Dispatch.

“We hope (the pantry) can alleviate, for the students that are most in need, some of the stress that they experience in not knowing where their next meal is coming from,” she said.

The pantry will be open from 1 to 6 p.m. on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. Students can come in once a week, and BCP provides a makeshift grocery list so they can feel like they are actually shopping, said Clarke, one of BCP’s three graduate assistant staff members.

There was “a good rush” of students when the doors first opened, Clarke said, but by 3 p.m. the shop was empty, most likely due to the stormy weather.

Hackett and Dominique Williams, both juniors, came in around 4:30 despite the downpour and filled a bag with canned soup, beans, apple juice and paper towels, among other things. When Hackett picked up bread and peanut butter and asked for jelly, Clarke made sure he and Williams were OK with the only available flavor, grape, before handing them a jar.

A group effort

Mayah Emerson knew that other Southeastern Conference universities had professional clothes closets, she said, so she included the idea in her platform when she successfully ran for president of the Mississippi State University Student Association in the spring semester of 2018.

“Students were asking about places to access professional clothing, so we really just saw it as meeting a need,” Emerson said.

The idea expanded to include a food pantry when the Office of Student Affairs got involved, she said, and her successor, current SA president Jake Manning, continued her work with the university to bring BCP to life.

Over about 18 months, BCP amassed 900 cans of vegetables, 400 cans of fruit and more than 1,000 toothbrushes and tubes of toothpaste, to name a few, said Montelleo Hobley, behavioral intervention team coordinator in the MSU Dean of Students’ Office.

A wide variety of student organizations and campus departments worked to stock the pantry, including MSU Athletics, which held drives at several football games and offered free tickets to two basketball games in exchange for donations, Hyatt said. MSU Police Chief Vance Rice asked every officer in the department to fill a box with supplies, and they did, Hyatt said.

BCP collected tax-deductible monetary donations through the MSU Foundation, which will continue to identify and pursue donors, and student organizations will help by holding food and supply drives, Hyatt said.

MSU President Mark Keenum had three words for Hyatt when she approached him with the idea for BCP: “Make it happen.”

“When we think about people who are in need of food, we tend to think about people in far-off, distant lands, but we have people in need right here in our own community, right here on our campus,” Keenum told a crowd of about 50 at Friday’s press conference.

BCP is the newest addition to MSU’s Food Security Network, which includes the Block by Block program for students to donate part of their meal plan to other students and the Maroon Meals alert system for the location and availability of food on campus.

Block by Block currently serves between 200 and 300 students, with participation increasing in recent years, Hyatt said. Faculty in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition are conducting research that will hopefully shed more light on how prevalent food insecurity is on the MSU campus, she said.

BCP will remain stocked with food items thanks to partnerships with the United Way of Central Mississippi and the Hattiesburg-based nonprofit Extra Table, as well as student and faculty donations, Hyatt said. The donation boxes in the back of the building saw several contributions Friday, Clarke said.

The staff is open to feedback on what students need that BCP does not yet have, such as shoes and a section for baby supplies. Hackett asked the staff for salt and pepper, and Clarke put it on the list of items to add.

After filling their bag, Hackett and Williams hoped to catch a bus in order to stay out of the rain on their way out of BCP Friday afternoon. Hackett, a first-semester transfer student from Hinds Community College in Raymond, said he is grateful for the pantry’s help but hopes he does not find himself using it often.

“I know there are more disadvantaged people than I am,” he said.","STARKVILLE — Deshaun Hackett didn’t want to take the last carton of milk from the refrigerator, but Harmony Clarke insisted.

105,105,3 weeks ago,Scott County Times,SALTER:China trade standoff resolution is critical for Mississippi farmers seeking vital markets,"Below is an opinion column by Sid Salter:

For Mississippi farmers, the transition between the administrations of former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden could not be more impactful on any topic more so than in agricultural trade with China.

China is the third leading trading partner for Mississippi exports behind Canada and Mexico, with $759 million in value in 2020 – with that number representing a 63.8 percent increase over the previous year. That grow came after 2018-2019 tariffs standoff between China and the Trump administration led to hundreds of millions in lost export revenues to Mississippi producers.

A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018. The same study found that in 2018, trade with China supported 64,000 Mississippi jobs – which highlighted the need for China to abide by the commitments under the “phase one” trade agreements.

Writing in Foreign Policy on Oct. 27, 2020, Clark Packard framed the U.S. China trade standoff succinctly: “Trump’s aggressive trade war with China took things from bad to worse for U.S. farmers. Over the course of about 18 months, Washington and Beijing engaged in a back-and-forth volley of escalating trade restrictions, including Chinese retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,000 categories of U.S. agricultural products such as pork, soybeans, dairy products, and nuts.

“In January 2020, the two sides signed a detente, but it’s only a temporary reprieve to a conflict that continues to fester and is likely to resurface in the near future. As part of the so-called phase one agreement, Beijing agreed to purchase about $32 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products over two years,” he observed.

Why should this matter to Mississippians? China’s path to superpower status is blocked most readily by their struggle to produce enough food to feed its own 1.4 billion population and also influence and alleviate regional concerns over hunger and food insecurity.

China has been able in recent years to produce rice and wheat sufficient to meet the nation’s needs, but still must import soybeans and corn as feedstuffs sufficient to satisfy the population’s growing taste for meat.

Not only is China’s massive population problematic in producing hunger and food insecurity issues, but pollution, water aquifer depletion, and the impacts of climate change are also threatening future internal abilities to feed that nation and her allies. The loyalty of regional neighbor nations dependent on food aid also remains in the balance moving forward.

In reaction to the U.S.-China trade standoff, Mississippi (along with Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska) in 2019 cut a trade deal with Taiwan for them to import about $2 billion in soybeans and corn in 2020 and 2021.

But prior to the trade war, about 80 percent of the state’s soybean production was being sold to China. Under Biden’s new Secretary of Agriculture, initial reports are that China is living up to most of its pledges on the “phase one” trade deal. That deal called for China to buy $12.5 billion in American agriculture products in 2020 and another $19.5 billion in 2021.

Vilsack blames the COVID-19 pandemic as an obstacle to China’s meeting the deal but says he’s optimistic and with apparent evidence on his side. Politico reports that U.S. farm exports are projected to hit a record $31.5 billion during Biden’s first year in office – some $4.5 billion than projected in November 2020.

Mississippi farmers producing soybeans and corn hope those projections are accurate and that Biden’s national security and trade advisors can restore American access to vital Chinese markets.

Despite global concerns over the future of shipping, trade and maritime security issues in the South China Sea, it remains advantageous for China to keep imports of food and feed grains coming to supplement what they can’t successfully produce on their own.

Before the Trump trade wars, two of every three Mississippi soybeans were sold to China. Mississippi farmers would like to see that trade relationship restored.","A 2020 study by Business Roundtable found that international trade supported 326,200 Mississippi jobs in 2018.

106,106,"May 31, 2020",The Guardian,'People are going to go hungry': pandemic effects could leave 54m Americans without food,"A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.

Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures.

As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year – a 63% increase compared to 2018.

Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.

America’s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.

Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities.

It’s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020.

The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% – 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 – and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% – 4.8 points higher than 2018.

In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children.

Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen.

“We were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don’t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,” said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city.

Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. “People are going to go hungry, that’s the truth,” said Scott.

The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year – a rise of almost 60% since 2018.

Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February.

“This pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,” said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

On Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, 1,400 or so cars lined up at a mobile distribution point, which was open for three hours, for grocery boxes of canned fruits, pinto beans, pasta, milk, fresh vegetables, frozen meat and bread, to help make ends meet for a month.

Historically, there was a shortfall of 34m meals every year in the five counties served by the Community Food Bank of southern Arizona. Currently, the demand remains sky high – double pre-pandemic levels, and statewide 17% of the workforce have claimed unemployment since the start of the crisis.

“We were getting darn close to closing the meal gap before the crisis,” said Michael McDonald, the CEO. “But if demand continues at this rate for the rest of the year or into next year, we’re going to fall way short. I don’t see us being able to keep up without a longer-term commitment from the federal government.”

One in three children in Arizona could go hungry this year without food aid.

Food banks aren’t in it alone.

Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product.

In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)’s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries.

But it’s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights.

“Everything feels so unpredictable, I’ve literally no idea what’s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,” said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts.

In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 – a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit. Only a tiny fraction of the USDA contracts went to distributors in New England.

As states start to reopen for business, economic recovery is expected to be painfully slow especially if further outbreaks are not adequately contained, which could trigger a full-blown second wave of the pandemic. Underemployment could last for years, which means millions of Americans are likely to need help with food, utilities and rent in the medium and long term.

Los Angeles county, where almost half the state of California’s Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, is projected to have 1.68 million food insecure people this year – the highest number in the country. It’s the most populous county in the US, with 10 million residents, where unemployment has risen to 20.3% – five percentage points higher than the state average – and food stamp applications have almost tripled compared with last year.

“If the numbers stay like this, no way food banks can cope, it’s beyond our capabilities, a lot will depend on how long federal help lasts,” said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Food Bank, which has distributed 80% more groceries since the pandemic began.

Susan King, president of Feeding Northeast Florida, agrees: “It’s when the dust settles that I’m most worried about, when the federal and state help is over but the line of people waiting for food is still long.”

King added: “This is a marathon, we can’t sugarcoat how scary it is; it absolutely keeps me up at night.”","Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network.
Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels.

107,107,"Oct 29, 2019",WCBI,Some communities in Mississippi struggle with food deserts,"SHUQUALAK, Miss. (WCBI) – According to Feeding America, 1 in 5 Mississippians is struggling with hunger.

For some, grocery stores are far away, and farmer’s markets are nonexistent. But there are things communities can do to help.

Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible. In Mississippi, Dr. Kenya Cistrunk said nearly every county has pockets of desert areas.

“So when you think about Mississippi, and how rural our state is then you obviously we have to acknowledge that there are some areas that will not have access to supermarkets. How do we make sure that people who are in those areas have access to healthy food options,” said Cistrunk?

Some retailers are changing their business models – expanding into rural areas and offering some grocery options.

“Just to have something right here to grab bread, eggs, household, it means the world we are grateful to have the Dollar General here,” said Shirley Moore Blakley.

But even though these stores have some benefits, they also pose some challenges.

“When you think about someone who’s hungry and trying to get food, if I can get to Dollar General and purchase that frozen meal or the canned food at a price that works with my budget, then at least it gets me something. Where we want to get people to understand that those might not be the healthiest options and how do we help them learn those skills and techniques that they may not know, to grow their own vegetables and fruit,” said Cistrunk.

Cistrunk said it will take a broader approach to help those facing food insecurity.

“We’re talking about from a community level, not just individuals but from a community, level addressing food insecurity, through the community gardens, through the community-supported agricultural a model. Where people can purchase, you know food bags, if they have the funds or use their EBT benefits to go to the farmers market to be able to purchase the foods that they need,” said Cistrunk.

573,610 Mississippians experienced food insecurity in 2017 according to feeding America. While that number is high, it down nearly 100,000 from 2015.","- Advertisement -Food deserts are defined as an area where healthy food isn’t easily accessible.

It was 2009 and Edwards Street Fellowship Center in Hattiesburg was in dire straits. There were needy people who were hungry, and the food pantry had no food. Officials there didn't know what to do, so they reached out to local restaurateur Robert St. John, owner of such establishments as The Purple Parrot and Crescent City Grill. Surely, he could help.

""They were feeding about 800 people a month and they had no food on their shelves,"" St. John remembered. ""They called me in a panic.

""The quickest and easiest way (for me to get the food they needed) was for me to call my Sysco rep. That got me thinking — there was probably a way to supply these people if we applied business principals to nonprofits.""

Getting Sysco to drop ship an order wasn't as easy as St. John thought it would be. Most of the items at the world's largest food service distributor were large and institutional-sized. After a few days combing through the 15,000 items in the Sysco catalog, St. John finally put together an order and had it shipped to the pantry, just in time to make sure its clients got fed.

It was on that day that St. John's charity Extra Table was born — in concept, if not in name.

Story continues after photo gallery.

Later, St. John approached Sysco about working with him to supply food pantries and soup kitchens with food monthly. What if every business and home had an extra table where they could feed people in need, he wondered. What would that look like? He was committed to finding out.

Extra Table is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending hunger by providing food panties and soup kitchens with new, healthy food for the hungry in their communities. It serves 32 agencies in 26 counties in Mississippi, including Forrest and Lamar.

Extra Table has attracted the attention of some of Mississippi's elite. Sen. Thad Cochran's retirement dinner in Jackson on Thursday and a Mac McAnally concert at FestivalSouth in Hattiesburg Saturday are just two of the high-profile events to raise money for Extra Table.

When Extra Table raises money to buy food, all of the donations go to food purchases. And Extra Table procures only certain kinds of food with its contributions.

""I started Extra Table with two basic principals,"" St. John said. ""One hundred percent of the money we raise for food will always go to food, and the food has always got to be healthy.""

Martha Allen, Extra Table's executive director, said the food the organization provides are supplies on which agencies can rely.

""We provide healthy, shelf-stable food to pantries and food kitchens,"" Allen said. ""They eagerly await the deliveries because they are so large, and it's food they can count on — proteins, rice, beans, powdered milk. It comes every month.""

Ann McCullen, executive director of Edwards Street Fellowship Pantry, said the type of food Extra Table gives is exactly what her clients need.

""It's such a huge blessing,"" she said. ""The vegetables, the soups are sodium-free or low-sodium. If it's fruit, it's going to be packed in juice or water.

""The kind of people who come to the food pantry have diabetes or high blood pressure or both, so it's really important the food they receive is healthy.""

Extra Table delivers 3,000 pounds of food a month to Edwards Street. Last year, because of the tornado, it increased its donations, dropping off a total of 42,000 pounds of goods.

McCullen said the food feeds a wide range of people.

""We have families, we have senior citizens who live alone,"" she said. ""We have older adults who are suddenly raising grandchildren. We have young families. We have college students.

""Need knows no boundaries. Some people are with us for a season. Some are with us for a long time.""

Extra Table's services are badly needed at Edwards Street and in Mississippi. The state has the nation's largest number of documented food insecure individuals.

""We have 670,000 Mississippians who suffer from food insecurity,"" St. John said. ""(Of those,) 250,000 are school kids who get a school breakfast and a school lunch, but then don't eat again until the next day.

""We have seniors who don't know whether to pay the light bill or buy food.""

According to the Mississippi Health and Hunger Atlas from the University of Mississippi, food insecurity is high in Forrest County, lower in Lamar. Extra Table says there are more hungry individuals in Hinds County — 57,000 — than the entire population of North Dakota.

Much needs to be done. The additional monies required to meet food needs in Mississippi is more than $282.8 million.

Extra Table is a two-person operation running on a shoestring budget. Administrative costs are not taken out of donations received for food. The services provided are critically important to eliminating hunger in Mississippi and beyond, as St. John considers expanding Extra Table's reach to the entire South and the country.

Allen said Extra Table is about more than feeding hungry people. By giving them healthy, low-sodium, low-sugar food, the nonprofit is providing efficient fuel to power brains and souls.

""When you give someone food, you give them hope and belief to go on and survive another day,"" she said.

For St. John, Extra Table has become a mission. He enjoys running restaurants, he said, but Extra Table feeds his heart.

""I'm a guy who sells filet mignon for a living,"" he said. ""But I also get canned tuna to places that need it.

""At the end of the day, I'd like to be known as the guy who gets food to people who don't have food.""

109,109,"Dec 1, 2020",Civil Eats,Black Farmers Say They Were Dropped from the USDA’s Food Box Program,"Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

“’Acorn squash, sweet corn, green peas, watermelon! Thank you, Jesus!’ They just went on and on,” said Cooley, who is retired and works as the city’s senior center coordinator. “I cannot express what these food boxes meant to so many people.”

The boxes—part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box program—came overflowing with produce grown by small-scale, Black-owned farms in the South. And they were delivered to Laurel by the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a group that represents Black farmers, landowners, and their cooperatives.

This summer, the Federation supplied 19,000 boxes over a three-and-a-half month period to 20 nonprofit organizations, churches, and community groups, which distributed them across Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. The boxes were handed out in places like Laurel, a town of 18,000 people whose population is 60 percent Black and where one-third of residents live under the poverty line and typically can’t afford to buy such fresh produce, said Cooley.

And although the program lifted up Black farmers battered by COVID-19 closures, reached historically underserved food-insecure communities, engaged scores of volunteers, and created two dozen jobs, the Federation’s food box contract has not been renewed. Other small growers across the U.S. say they were also snubbed by the USDA over the past three months, despite successfully fulfilling their earlier contracts.

Instead, the agency awarded new contracts to large suppliers—giant food distributors such as Sysco. The move left growers with unsold crops and communities in the rural South and other areas hard-hit by the pandemic with diminished access to produce.

“When we no longer had a contract [from USDA] it wasn’t like [the Black farmers] got a call from one of these other suppliers. They were just left out. There was a big void that was left,” said Cornelius Blanding, the Federation’s executive director.

Despite Challenges, Program Helps Farmers, Families

Launched in May under the USDA’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families was meant to help farmers, whose markets were upended by the pandemic, and funnel unsold produce and dairy to the neediest Americans.

The program was authorized to spend $3 billion in April and was expanded by another $1 billion at the end of summer. At the end of October, just before the election, the USDA announced it would add another $500 million in funding to continue Farmers to Families through December.

Through four rounds of contracts, the program has to date delivered more than 110 million food boxes. As the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pandemic hunger relief, it has been much touted by government officials, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has called it “a miracle.”

Yet Farmers to Families has been plagued with challenges. When it launched in May, industry leaders accused the USDA of giving lucrative contracts to companies with little experience of working with farmers or storing and distributing perishable goods.

Complaints about geographic distribution gaps (some parts of the country not getting enough boxes, others getting too many), delays, and inflated payments to some contractors have also surfaced. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is leading an investigation into the program.

In October, the USDA again drew ire when it mandated that a self-promoting letter signed by President Trump be included, both in English and Spanish, in the food-aid boxes. Many nonprofits that distributed the boxes decided to remove the letters due to worries that they would be seen as political activity just weeks before the election.

Despite such issues, organizations around the country have praised the program for feeding Americans at a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing in the U.S.

In the case of the Federation, the contract made it possible to pay fair-market prices for the more than half-million pounds of produce it purchased from 35 Black farmers—a boon given that the vast majority of farmers and landowners surveyed by the organization have seen their markets disappear due to the pandemic.

The support was badly needed, since small-scale Black farms typically operate within razor-thin margins, with 80 percent making less than $50,000 annually farming, Blanding said. And because they had crops already in the ground when the pandemic hit, the food box program not only gave them a source of income but also helped avoid significant financial loss.

“Without this [program], I don’t know where they would have gone. I can’t even imagine it,” Blanding said.

For Ben Burkett, a member of the Indian Springs Farms Association, a Mississippi vegetable marketing cooperative that’s a member of the Federation, the food box program was a godsend: Through it, the co-op’s members were able to sell the crops they had already planted for New Orleans restaurants and food service establishments, which shuttered when COVID-19 hit.

“This program stepped in just in time,” said Burkett. “And it was a blessing on both sides.”

The co-op’s members, who are all Black farmers, delivered about 11,000 boxes between May and August. The produce was a high-quality, colorful range of fruits and vegetables, said Burkett, and was delivered to families the day after it was picked. Such a feat was possible on a grand scale, Burkett said, because of an incredible upswelling of community support.

“Some people just came to volunteer, others we were able to pay for their work,” added the farmer. “It brought the community together.”","Every time Lula Cooley dropped off food boxes at Black churches or on the doorsteps of low-income senior citizens in Laurel, Mississippi, she was met with jubilation.

110,110,"Jan 6, 2021",HubcitySPOKES.com,Extra Table on a whirlwind mission to feed hungry citizens in Mississippi,"In a year in which it seems the headlines are filled with endless negative and controversial news stories, I thought it might be a nice break in the action to report on a few positive activities that occurred in 2020.

Extra Table is a feeding charity that I founded in 2009. We supply healthy food to mission pantries and soup kitchens all across the state. Beginnings don’t get humbler than the early days of Extra Table. It all started with a phone call from one local mission pantry that was feeding 800 families a month. They were completely out of food and called me to see if there was any way I could help them stock the shelves.

Out of that one phone call, an idea was born based on the premise, “What if every business and home had an extra table where they could feed those in need?” To be honest with you, though, I wasn’t even sure if there was a hunger problem in Mississippi. So, I went on a fact-finding mission visiting soup kitchens and mission pantries across the state, and it didn’t take long to learn that there is a huge hunger problem in Mississippi.

What I learned is that almost 25% of the state suffers from what the government calls “food insecurity.” In Mississippi, a quarter of the state’s children eat a school breakfast and a school lunch and then don’t eat again until the next day. There are also over 100,000 seniors who – at this very moment – are trying to figure out whether they can pay the light bill or go to the grocery store. The problem is real, and the problem is serious.

It’s not that Mississippi didn't have enough agencies to feed those in need. Mississippi is blessed to have many agencies on the front lines of hunger, and they are all staffed by dedicated people and hundreds of volunteers. The problem is that the agencies couldn’t keep food on the shelves to keep up with the demand.

Extra Table’s initial working model was based on my experience in the restaurant world. In the early days, we used the purchasing power of foodservice distributors – and their distribution capabilities – to send food directly to Mississippi’s feeding agencies. Over time, Extra Table’s business model changed to where we often cut out the middleman these days and – along with our partners at Chow Purchasing – acquire food directly from growers, canners and suppliers and deliver it ourselves. By doing that, we increased our effectiveness.

I could teach a master class on how to start and grow a nonprofit. Most of the class would be spent on how hard it is in the early years to gain footing and become effective. Growing a 501(c)(3) is a very slow and arduous process. Around our eighth year we started seeing major growth. But in our 11th year, and in the middle of a global pandemic, we hit our stride.

The timing has to have been a God thing. When Mississippians needed food the most, Extra Table was set up and ready to deliver it to them. By almost all accounts, 2020 was a terrible year on almost every front, but when it comes to food insecurity, and feeding Mississippians in need, Extra Table saw unprecedented growth and success.

From day one of opening my first restaurant in 1987, I have always believed in one core principle: always give credit where credit is due. A major part of Extra Table’s unprecedented success in 2020 should be credited to our volunteers, donors and partners. But it takes leadership to accomplish great things, and for the last three years, Extra Table has been led by an amazing woman who possesses the perfect skill set for a nonprofit executive director – endless energy, total passion and commitment for the cause, the ability to communicate the need to others, prodigious team building, and the dedication to work tirelessly for those in need. That person is Martha Allen, and for more than half of 2020, she ran a statewide nonprofit as the lone employee. It wasn’t until late summer that she added a second employee (keep that in mind while reading the following paragraph).

The charitable feeding community measures food distribution and effectiveness in pounds. In 2019 – our most effective year to date – Extra Table distributed 268,000 pounds of food. In 2020, working under the adverse conditions of a global pandemic, Extra Table’s Martha Allen, her staff of one and hundreds of dedicated volunteers distributed over 1,200,000 pounds of food to Mississippians in need. That’s more than a 400% increase over the previous year. And if a 400% increase wasn’t impressive enough, we also partnered with Borden Dairy and distributed over half of a million gallons of milk – that’s an additional 4,700,000 pounds to those in the charitable feeding community – to agencies and citizens from north Mississippi to the Gulf Coast (a more than 2,200% increase).

Extra Table started the year delivering healthy food 39 agencies in 32 counties. We ended 2020 by partnering with 62 feeding agencies in 49 Mississippi counties.

One of the things I am most proud of when it comes to Extra Table is that two of our core principles from day one have been that 100% of the money we raise for food is used to purchase food. (We started an entirely new 501(c)(3) to raise money for our minimal administrative costs so we can always stay true to that mission.) Secondly, the food we purchase will always be healthy food. The Extra Table model is unique. We operate on a shoestring out of a borrowed corner of my business office. There may be another statewide nonprofit that operates with only two paid staff, but I would bet several paychecks that you couldn’t find one that is as effective.

In 2020, Extra Table Executive Director Martha Allen, Director of Development Rhonda Hayden, Chow Purchasing and hundreds of volunteers delivered 25,000 pounds of Mississippi Gulf shrimp; 35,000 pounds of rice, grits, and beans; 95,000 pounds of chicken; 160,000 pounds of potatoes; 550,000 gallons of milk; and 840,000 eggs to Mississippians in need.

Extra Table has gone from a steady crawl to an all-out sprint, but we are just getting started in Mississippi’s hunger battle. The future is bright as one of our main initiatives in 2021 will be reimagining the old and outdated canned food drive model. We took the first steps of that this year with our new box project in which we began distributing boxes of healthy food to those in need. For more information on that effort, and how you can be a part of one of Mississippi’s fastest growing and most effective nonprofits, go to extratable.org.

111,111,"Aug 7, 2020",Jackson Clarion Ledger,Immigrants in Mississippi ICE raids suffer; plants see few penalties,"Hours after immigration agents arrested about 680 Mississippi poultry plant employees in the largest single-state worksite raid in the country’s history, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had a message for employers.

“To those who take advantage of illegal aliens, to those who use illegal aliens for a competitive advantage or to make a quick buck, we have something to say to you. If we find that you have violated federal criminal law, we’re coming after you,” Hurst said in a news conference on Aug. 7, 2019.

One year later, attorneys and advocates say there is a grave imbalance. The consequences for workers, their families and communities have been devastating and could last for years. In contrast, the top executives at the chicken processing companies targeted in the raids have yet to face penalties for their role in hiring hundreds of undocumented workers and profiting from their labor.

On Aug. 6, Hurst held a news conference at the federal courthouse in Jackson, Miss., to announce the unsealed indictments of four managers at two of the seven chicken processing plants that federal agents raided one year prior. Hurst did not announce any charges against company owners.

Three weeks prior to the news conference, Hurst sat down for a one-on-one interview to discuss the progress of the investigation and why, at that time, no managers at the chicken plants had been charged with any crimes.

Hurst said the investigation — slightly delayed by COVID-19 — was still ongoing as federal agents were combing through millions of pages of documents and terabytes of data seized from the companies.

“Let me be clear: We don’t have any hesitation to bring charges against anyone,"" Hurst said in an interview on July 17. ""There’s not going to be any inside or outside influence that either pressures us to prosecute or pressures us not to prosecute.”

Still, many have been critical of how federal agents carried out the raids and the continued absence of prosecution for owners of chicken processing companies.

Among them is Cliff Johnson, director of the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center, who had previously worked as an assistant U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration and helped represent workers in the aftermath of the August raids.

“The government must not ignore the behavior of corporate fat cats while zip-tying and locking up more than 600 workers making less than $15 an hour. Selective prosecution of the poor and vulnerable is repugnant and does not reflect the values of this country as I understand them,” Johnson said in early July.

Hurst has defended the process and maintains that his office's primary goal is to ensure law and order. Plant employees who worked under stolen identities will be treated no differently than anyone else who breaks the law and is brought to justice, he said.

When the evidence shows that the companies knowingly hired undocumented workers, then Hurst said he wouldn't hesitate to prosecute employers in criminal court — which his office has done successfully on eight occasions in the last 14 years.

If the government starts turning a blind eye to undocumented immigrants, ""then you’re not going to have any more respect for the law, and pretty soon you’re not going to have order. We’re going to have chaos,"" Hurst said.

For hundreds of undocumented Mississippians and their families, the chaos began a year ago.

Employers 'never suffer what we have had to suffer'

The morning after the raids, Ermicenda Perez was released at 4 a.m., with an ankle monitor and the promise that ICE would call her to court for immigration hearings.

She was arrested while working at PH Food, her employer of eight years and one of two poultry plants in the rural town of Morton, where semi trucks filled with live caged chickens regularly roll past downtown.

Perez broke down as she recalled the raids last year.

“It’s hard to talk about,” she whispered, lowering her head and fighting back tears.

As the single mother of two teenage girls, Perez was among about 300 workers released within 27 hours of the raids on humanitarian grounds. While she’s home with her daughters, she hasn’t been able to work and is relying on donations to help cover bills and feed her family.

“It’s hard not being able to do anything,” Perez said. “To go from working, to sitting at home not being able to do anything. It’s hard to bear because I came here to work. ... I was just trying to support my family.”

While hundreds of families face housing instability, food insecurity, criminal prosecution, deportation and family separation, history shows that worksite raids are often mere blips in a company’s operations, according to experts interviewed for this report.

Across the country, most employers are never criminally prosecuted after an ICE raid, said Jessie Hahn, a labor and employment policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. Hahn said criminal cases are typically settled in court with the company agreeing to pay a fine and operate under ICE monitoring for several years. Company managers or owners could face jail time, but it’s rare, she said.

POTENTIAL PENALTIES: Mississippi ICE raids: Employers can face civil, criminal charges

One undocumented worker put it this way, according to immigration attorney Amelia McGowan, who works for the Mississippi Center for Justice and helped represent many who were arrested during the raids: “I had to work in terrible conditions, my husband is in jail, I’ve got an ankle monitor. The people who ran these companies are sitting at home and they’re fine. They will never suffer what we have had to suffer and had to suffer for this company.”

Some workers deported, others fight to stay with families

The ICE operation and investigation, which began 18 months before the raids and continues to this day, cost taxpayers more than $1.3 million, according to ICE officials in November 2019.

A spokesman for the federal agency has declined to provide an updated cost estimate or confirm the number of deportees. McGowan estimates at least 170 workers have been deported.

The majority of workers remained in ICE detention for weeks or months following arrests. It’s unclear how many were able to bond out and how many are still detained in centers, some of which face allegations of lack of food, inadequate medical care, unsanitary conditions and have been the sites of COVID-19 outbreaks.

EXCLUSIVE: Ankle monitors and informants: How ICE chose 7 Mississippi food plants to raid

According to ICE, a total of 126 people have been charged with committing federal crimes, 73 of whom have been convicted. The workers were accused of illegally re-entering the country after a previous deportation, as well as document fraud from working under someone else's name or social security number. The four managers were charged with harboring undocumented immigrants and making false statements to law enforcement, among other crimes.

In November, Congressman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., held a hearing on the ICE raids to criticize the federal approach to arresting Latino workers who, according to testimony by the sheriff of Scott County, posed no threat to public safety and were valued members of their communities.

At the congressional hearing, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, criticized law enforcement's lack of action against company leaders.

""You don't have a perp walk for the employers. They don't get arrested. You don't handcuff them and take them away. ... You knew before you came that laws were being broken, but you picked on the undocumented persons,"" Green said.

Last year, lines of manacled men and women shuffled into federal courtrooms in Jackson. They conferred in hurried whispers with their attorneys through interpreters. Some faced the judge with stony faces, others wiped away their tears.

THE CHILDREN: Where are Mom and Dad? School on standby to help children in aftermath of ICE raids

Watching the hearings unfold, it struck Federal Public Defender Omodare Jupiter that he had never seen so many young mothers brought into court before. The defendants had fled abuse and poverty in their home countries so they could work in “terrible conditions for very little pay in just in hopes of trying to give their children a better life,” Jupiter said.

“To use the criminal justice system to prosecute people in those types of circumstances, to this day I don’t understand it,” he said. “I don’t understand it at all.”

Critics: Raids part of escalating immigration enforcement

The ICE operation in Mississippi was the largest in a series of escalating worksite raids in recent years, said Wendy Cervantes, director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy, who researched the impacts of raids in Mississippi and other states.

Cervantes and other immigrant advocates have criticized how federal agents executed the raids in Mississippi. She described the raids as “aggressive and militaristic” and Mississippians she interviewed likened it to a terrorist attack, Cervantes said.

“The cruelty with how individuals were treated seemed completely unnecessary. I talked to one mother who didn’t have an opportunity to use the bathroom or clean herself for more than two days. She was suffering from infection,” Cervantes said.

Hahn said the raids were carried out in a way “intentionally to terrorize immigrant workers and their communities while employers have faced minimal consequences.”

Hundreds of workers were taken into custody during ICE raids at seven Mississippi chicken processing plants on Aug. 7, 2019, and those who were released days later were given ankle monitors.

Hurst said that’s an “absolute falsehood.”

He said federal agents went to “extraordinary measures to try to make sure that families were minimally disrupted” by checking if children at home had at least one parental caretaker and dropping off workers where they were arrested after release.

“This really was the most compassionate execution of criminal search warrants I’ve ever seen involving immigration violations,” Hurst said. “I know people are going to disagree with that and that’s fine. But we did ... put a lot of thought into making sure that people were treated humanely, and with respect.”

Hurst points to history of prosecuting employers

Hurst disagrees with those who cast families impacted by the raids in a sympathetic light. The same kind of attention isn’t paid to the hundreds of other defendants prosecuted by his office any given year, Hurst said.

“It really bothers me there’s a double standard just because this is a hot political issue, just because people don’t agree necessarily with our immigration laws,” he said.

Focus instead on the U.S. citizens whose identities were stolen and social security benefits were interrupted, Hurst urged. ICE found at least 400 stolen social security numbers related to the ongoing criminal investigation, spokesman Bryan Cox said.

Victims of identity fraud aren’t the only ones that have benefited from the arrests of undocumented immigrants, Hurst said.

“I think all the American citizens who flooded into these companies, applying for jobs that were opened up are better off,"" he said. ""I think we’re all better off because at least in the state of Mississippi, employers want to think twice now about trying to hire illegal aliens.""

Hurst said his office “probably has prosecuted more employers for criminal immigration violations per capita than any other non-border state in the nation.”

According to a list provided by Hurst, since 2006, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi has prosecuted a manager or owner in eight cases against employers ranging from small family-owned restaurants to one of the biggest employers in the state.

The largest case was that of electrical transformer plant Howard Industries, which resulted in the arrests of nearly 600 workers in 2008. The company was sentenced to one year probation and required to pay a $2.5 million fine. A human resources manager, Jose Humberto Gonzalez, was sentenced to six months house arrest and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine.

PAST RAIDS: Undocumented workers busted. Employers often not. What we learned from 6 ICE raids in U.S.

Hurst said he has a long-held belief that the government must go after employers who violate federal criminal laws.

“Jobs are a magnet of those who want to come into our country illegally,” Hurst said. “If you do not (prosecute employers), that magnet is only going to grow stronger and individuals are only going to want to come in here in larger droves illegally for those jobs.”

Chicken plants not likely to see long-term impact from raids

The day after the raids, PH Food manager Jun Liang showed a reporter around the silent and near-empty plant, and reflected on the arrests of about 80 of his workers.

""To me, it's not logical that they've done this. What about (the immigrants') families? They have to make a living, they have kids. Right?"" Liang said. ""They didn't do anything bad, they just want to make money, raise their kids.""

Reached by phone nearly a year later, Liang declined to talk, citing advice from his attorney. Other poultry companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.

There’s no doubt the companies suffered a staffing shortage after losing hundreds of workers to the raids. Just five days later, Koch Foods held a job fair in Forest, where a few dozen prospective workers showed up to learn more about how they could be paid $12 an hour to kill and process chickens.

It’s unlikely that chicken plants will be impacted in the longterm, said Angela Stuesse a professor of anthropology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, who spent years living in Mississippi and researching Latino immigration and the poultry industry.

“We know that this industry is really very sophisticated at figuring out how to locate and tap into the most exploitable work forces,” Stuesse said. “They’ve shown historically they can very quickly replace even very large segments of the workforce that they lose.”

However, new hires don’t necessarily stay employed long term, Johnson said.

“I’ve been told stories about new workers appearing on the job and leaving before the end of the day due to the difficulty of the work and the unpleasant realities of processing thousands of chicken each shift,” Johnson said.

Who replaces the new hires after they leave? Hahn and community advocates have said in some cases, the same people who were arrested one year ago are re-hired into the plants. Though these assertions are anecdotal and have not been independently tracked or confirmed.

“I have heard in Mississippi ... the (undocumented) workers are absolutely going back in — going back in more vulnerable to exploitation than before,” Hahn said.

The same communities devastated by the raids are now among legions of essential workers who continued to march to their shifts even as most of Mississippi’s economy shut down at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through the raids and now the pandemic, plants continued to churn out millions of chickens to be sent to dinner tables across America.

After learning a nearby chicken plant did not provide adequate personal protective equipment to their workers, a group of women in Forest decided to take matters into their own hands. They took out sewing machines and got to work. They ended up donating close to 1,700 cloth masks to chicken plant workers and a local hospital.

For them, the mission was personal. They were arrested at the same plant last year.

The coronavirus has spread among chicken plant workers and Latinos at high rates. There’s a sad irony, reflected Father Odel Medina, whose parishioners in Carthage were hit hard by the raids, in that chicken plant employees are now considered essential workers by the government.

“You say these people have to go ... because they don’t belong here,"" Medina said. ""When we need them, we tell them they’re essential. That is very immoral.""

KASIMU HARRIS, EVE EDELHEIT, PATIENCE ZALANGA Getty Images We Live in the Richest Country in the World — Yet Millions of Americans Go to Bed Hungry In this special report, Good Housekeeping and Feeding America explore the complex issue of food insecurity through photographs.



The statistics on hunger in America are staggering. One in nine people in the U.S. is food insecure, meaning they lack consistent access to healthy meals, and many have visited a food bank in the past year. Now, as we brace for what could be the worst recession in more than a decade, millions of people hit by unemployment and struggling with poverty are newly at risk of not having enough to eat. To capture a literal snapshot of the issue and to highlight steps communities are taking to tackle it, Good Housekeeping, in partnership with Feeding America, sent photographers across the country, from the Louisiana bayou to the farmlands of Iowa and a religious community in Houston. The results reveal a resilient beauty in cities working hard to keep people fed. Our Growing Need In 2020, food insecurity is projected to increase by the highest percentage in parts of the South and Southwest. For example, in Mississippi, one in three people could go hungry this year.

Dead last and ranked 50th.

According to the just-released Map the Meal Gap 2019 report from Feeding America, 24.1% of kids age 18 and younger in New Mexico – that’s one of every four children – are at risk of childhood hunger and food insecurity.

The 2018 Map the Meal Gap also had New Mexico as dead last, and the 2017 report had the state ranked 49th.

This year’s 49th place holder is Arkansas with 23.6% of at-risk food insecure kids, then Louisiana at 23% and Mississippi at 22.9%.

................................................................

In contrast, the states with the fewest percentage of kids who are at risk of food insecurity are North Dakota, ranked first with 9.8% of kids, followed by Massachusetts at 11.7%, New Hampshire with 12.3% and Minnesota with 12.6%.

The Map the Meal Gap also showed that 324,000 people of all ages in the state, or 15.8% of the entire population, are at risk of hunger.

The worst five counties in New Mexico with the highest percentage of child hunger, according to the report are: McKinley, with 33.5%; Luna, 33.4%; Cibola and Catron, each with 30.4%; and Sierra, 27.8%.

Feeding America is the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States, coordinating a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. Together they provide meals to more than 46 million people each year. Roadrunner Food Bank is part of the Feeding America network.

Roadrunner Food Bank spokeswoman, Sonya Warwick, said food insecurity is generally understood as the inability of individuals or families to know where a portion of their food will come from at any given time.

“In some instances, that food insecurity results from adults in a family having unreliable seasonal jobs, or hourly workers suddenly finding that their hours were reduced, people who are unemployed or underemployed, those facing homelessness, domestic violence or health issues,” Warwick said.

Many people fall into the gray area, “where they’re still very poor, but make just over what might qualify them for federal food assistance programs, and that’s when Road Runner and statewide affiliated food partners can step in to help them,” Warwick said.

Of course the biggest factor in a state’s child hunger and food insecurity is the number of children who live in poverty. New Mexico is near the top of this list also.

Sharon Kayne, spokeswoman for New Mexico Voices for Children, said 27% of kids in our state live in poverty, ranking us 49th on this list, tied with Mississippi, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and compiled by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Only Louisiana fares worse, ranked in 50th place with 28% of kids living in poverty.

Data for the Map the Meal Gap report came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and food price data and analysis provided by Nielsen.","According to the just-released Map the Meal Gap 2019 report from Feeding America, 24.1% of kids age 18 and younger in New Mexico – that’s one of every four children – are at risk of childhood hunger and food insecurity.

The worst five counties in New Mexico with the highest percentage of child hunger, according to the report are: McKinley, with 33.5%; Luna, 33.4%; Cibola and Catron, each with 30.4%; and Sierra, 27.8%.
Of course the biggest factor in a state’s child hunger and food insecurity is the number of children who live in poverty."
119,119,"Nov 30, 2019",HottyToddy.com,Student Co-Directors Work Against Student Food Insecurity at UM,"The University of Mississippi Food Bank provides a discrete and much-needed source for food, hygiene products and more for Ole Miss students and employees each week.

Supported primarily through donations, the UM Food Bank provides hundreds of meals each semester. Since the fall semester began in August, the Food Bank, housed in Kinard Hall, Room 213, has provided an estimated 1,266 meals to community members.

Working behind-the-scenes at the Food Bank are Kate Reinhardt, a senior secondary mathematics education major, and Holten Moreno, a senior business administration major. Together, they serve as the Food Bank’s co-directors.

“As an education major, I know how important it is that students have access to food,” said Reinhardt, a St. Louis native. “Students shouldn’t have to worry about where their next meal will come from, and I just want to make sure that we can help get rid of that extra stress for them.”

Reinhardt began working with the Food Bank in 2018 as a member of the fundraising committee. Through her work as fundraising chair, she quickly realized how big an impact the Food Bank has on fighting student food insecurity.

The work lit a new passion in Reinhardt. After her first year, she decided to apply to be co-director in 2019. She began her new role earlier this year and has remained committed to helping fight student food insecurity at Ole Miss.

“I realized that I loved helping as fundraising chair so much and that helping the Food Bank was something that I really wanted to get more involved with,” Reinhardt said.

Moreno began working with the Food Bank in 2017 as a member of the volunteer and training committee. Before coming to UM, she was involved with a food bank in her hometown of Washington, D.C., and wanted to continue to work against food insecurity in Oxford.

“I think a food bank is particularly important on college campuses due to the rising expenses at this time of many students’ lives,” Moreno said. “Unfortunately, most of the time, money is pulled from their food budget, which is where we come in, and oftentimes students will try to go days without eating due to not being able to afford meals.

“We give them the opportunity to find their footing again financially by using the Food Bank to cut out cost from their budget.”

As co-directors, Reinhardt and Moreno work together to coordinate and plan with the student committee that oversees the resource’s operations. This semester alone, student volunteers have dedicated more than 205 hours to its operation, not counting the time committed by the student leadership team or group-based volunteering activities.

“Holten and Kate do an excellent job running the Food Bank,” said Lindsey Abernathy, associate director of the Office of Sustainability and staff adviser of the Food Bank. “The student directors are in charge of all operations, which is no small task, especially when also taking classes.”

The UM Food Bank is a registered student organization with the goal of ending campus hunger by providing food and hygiene products to students and employees. Its services are free to all students who might need it, regardless of financial situations.

“I think that sometimes students are unsure whether or not they qualify for our services, and we’re trying to focus on promoting the Food Bank as a place where all students can go, regardless of their financial situation,” Reinhardt said. “We focus on being discreet and not asking for any personal information regarding student ID number, name or financial information.”

Reinhardt and Moreno’s passion for serving the community in this capacity has only grown since they began working with the organization. Together, they lean on each other to make sure the Food Bank can provide for students and staff, and work to improve it any way they can.

“In addition to the daily operations of the Food Bank, the students are always looking toward the future and what else the Food Bank can offer,” Abernathy said. “Just this semester, Kate and Holten have worked with Ole Miss Dining Services to pilot a meal swipe donation program.”

Pioneered by Reinhardt and Moreno, this new initiative resulted in 200 meal swipes being donated to the Food Bank. Combined with a 100 percent match by Ole Miss Dining, the Food Bank was able to distribute more than 400 meal swipes to students who needed them in November.

Reinhardt is student-teaching in a geometry class at Pontotoc High School this semester. She will graduate in May with plans to either begin her teaching career or pursue a master’s degree.

Moreno also is set to graduate in May and plans to attend graduate school in England to obtain an MBA.

Reinhardt’s passion for helping those around her and Moreno’s commitment to fighting food insecurity make them a perfect fit as co-directors of the Food Bank.

“We’ve always wanted to help students,” Reinhardt said. “They’re here to learn, and they shouldn’t have to worry about finding food or where their next meal will come from.”

120,120,"May 16, 2019",The Hill,Criminal justice includes food security — we can't ban the social safety net,"Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has signed criminal justice reform legislation that will ease reentry for people returning home from prison. Among the most notable elements of the new law is an opt out of a 23-year-old federal ban on food stamps and financial assistance for people with felony drug convictions. The change will help protect the many people who confront hunger and poverty upon their release from prison.

Mississippi is the latest state to amend or rescind this cruel federal policy, which emerged when the political consensus of the 1990s supported punitive and racially charged approaches to both drugs and poverty.

President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonGood luck, Dan Bongino! Biden to headline campaign fundraiser for Atlanta mayor The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by Facebook — CDC updates guidelines for students MORE signed legislation in 1996 that significantly restricted access to the social safety net through work and eligibility requirements for financial assistance, and it established a lifetime ban on benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense. The changes followed years of congressional actions to establish harsh mandatory minimums for federal drug offenses and incentivize states to follow its lead in enacting long sentences. Unfair perceptions about people who use drugs, particularly crack cocaine, powered the debate.

While the law permits states to opt out of the ban, and ones as diverse as Arkansas, California, Maine and Wyoming have already done so, 30 states still maintain either a lifetime or modified ban on SNAP, TANF or both.

According to the National Institute of Health, 91 percent of people transitioning from incarceration report experiencing food insecurity. Moreover, employment opportunities for returning residents are limited because of outdated or inadequate skills, medical and mental health challenges and employer bias. A Harvard University study conducted by Bruce Western of 120 people in Boston found an initial average annual income of just $6,500 after incarceration.

The impoverished status of people leaving incarceration also exacerbates the financial conditions of the poor families to whom they return. By definition, families share with one another; more people in a household without more resources translates to less food for everyone in the family, including children.

States that have rejected the tough on crime approach to welfare reform have improved public safety outcomes. One study found that recidivism rates declined up to 10 percent one year after release when cash assistance and food stamps were immediately available to people returning home.

The growing bipartisan consensus supporting criminal justice reform should recognize the need to support people reentering our communities with educational services, drug treatment, housing assistance and financial and nutritional support.

These reforms are foundational to successful reintegration.

Fortunately, Congress may be showing it has learned from the mistakes of its past. Last year, the U.S. Senate successfully held off an amendment incorporated into the House of Representatives’ bill to reauthorize SNAP that would have extended the lifetime food stamp ban to people convicted of violent offenses. The amendment, which would have permanently excluded people from accessing food assistance regardless of the date of their offense, was widely opposed by civil rights and anti-hunger organizations as well as conservative groups known for their embrace of criminal justice reform. Its defeat is a hopeful sign.

In Mississippi, an estimated 67,000 people — disproportionately women — will gain access to food stamps because of the state’s decision to lift the federal ban. While championing the new law, Republican state Sen. Sally Dotson said, “the overall goal is for anyone who has previously been incarcerated or struggled with addiction to become productive members of our communities."" Evidence suggests that in this respect, Mississippi is on the right track.

121,121,"Nov 5, 2020",BetaBoston,Study: A million people in Mass. don’t have enough food,"Massachusetts has seen the highest percent increase of residents facing food insecurity of all states, according to new projections released by Feeding America last Friday. The hunger rate in the state has increased 59 percent since 2018, representing more than 1 million people who are now struggling to get enough to eat. The child food-insecurity rate has also worsened, with one in five children in Massachusetts now living in food-insecure households, a 102 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 levels. (Norfolk County in Massachusetts has the highest percent change in child food-insecurity in the country, with a 163 percent increase in 2020 versus 2018.)

As the country awaits the returns of the presidential election and any prospects of another economic stimulus bill, one thing has remained consistent amid the pandemic: People in Massachusetts are going hungry. And the problem is only growing.

The overall food insecurity rate in Massachusetts is projected to reach 14.2 percent this year. The highest rates in the United States will be in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, which could each have more than 20 percent of their citizens facing hunger. And California is predicted to have 6.2 million people who are having trouble getting enough to eat, the largest total number of any state in the country.

“The need isn’t going anywhere,” said Catherine Drennan, the director of public affairs for the Greater Boston Food Bank, which served over 600,000 people in September, a 120 percent increase over last year.

November and December are typically some of the busiest months for local food banks, but the combined economic, political, and public health crises facing the Commonwealth will make this year unlike any other, said Drennan. She said the food bank is planning to provide 20 million meals as part of its annual Hunger Free Holidays campaign.

New issues with a federal food-distribution program have stoked anxieties further among local organizations working to provide food to those in need. Back in May, as part of the CARES Act, the USDA launched its $4.5 billion Farmers to Families Food Box program, working with US farmers to purchase and distribute boxes of agricultural products. During the first three rounds of the program, several vendors in New England were awarded eight-week contracts, and each built a network of local distributors to hand out hundreds of thousands of prepacked boxes filled with dairy, meat, and produce.

Many of the boxes ended up being distributed to local nonprofits — like the Brazilian Workers Center in Allston — which are operating outside the established regional food bank networks, having launched or expanded emergency food services as they saw the need in their communities.

“Since COVID-19, we’ve had to repurpose our regular services to meet food insecurity in the community,” said the Brazilian Workers Center’s executive director, Natalicia Tracy. “The Boston food banks weren’t equipped to handle the demand, and we saw a huge increase in need for food in Allston. So the USDA boxes were really critical.” The Brazilian Workers Center now feeds 500 families each week.

But the execution of the food box program has been fraught. Farmers who won contracts and planted crops for the program were left high and dry when they weren’t chosen as vendors in subsequent rounds. In some parts of the country, there were concerns about the nutritional value of the goods included in the boxes. The USDA also faced blowback last month after President Trump required that a signed letter from him be included in each box.

In the agency’s latest funding round announced last Friday, no Massachusetts vendors were awarded contracts. This will likely mean significant delays in getting the next round of local food distributions up and running, leaving partner organizations like Tracy’s scrambling to find sources for food as they head toward Thanksgiving. So earlier this week, she headed back to the store. “We’ve already purchased 1,200 pounds of rice, beans, and pasta, and some produce. We’re still trying to figure out whatever we can get our hands on,” she said.

Those who have been working with the USDA say that the changes will put undue pressure on the Massachusetts food bank system during its busiest season.

“In two weeks these pantries are going to burn through whatever dry goods they have in back stock,"" said Sean Buchanan, the vice president of sales at Costa Fruit and Produce, one of the local distributors whose vendor contract with the USDA was not renewed. He said Costa handed out more than 889,000 food boxes to 400 partners since the program launched, only to have to turn off the faucet for the distributions on Monday.

“It’s a perfect storm for food insecurity,"" he said.

The USDA’s decision also forced produce distributor Katsiroubas Bros. to lay off 40 staff members overnight, said Torry Katsiroubas Stamm, the company’s president. Over the past several months, the Boston-based distributor had set up an elaborate supply chain and partnered with the nonprofit Boston Area Gleaners to deliver more than 10 million pounds of food to nonprofits, public housing sites, and food banks throughout New England, she said. The program has helped keep her business afloat as her restaurant and food service accounts have cut back on orders amid the pandemic.

Now, that supply chain has been upended, and a new company in Long Island, N.Y., has been given the contract and has to start over creating a distribution plan from scratch, she said.

“Our partners have been calling us, and we don’t have anything to tell them,” Katsiroubas said. “They’re panicked."" She said she feels the same level of stress she heard from her customers back in March, “with everyone saying ‘What do we do?' We’re still here, it feels like it’s happening again.”

“Before this program got up and running, we saw a lot of nonprofits that had never moved food or dealt with food moving thousands of boxes or grocery bags a week,” said Dylan Frazier, the director of strategy for the Boston Area Gleaners, which worked as both a vendor and partner with local distributors to make USDA food box deliveries. “We’re telling people you have to call the food bank, we don’t have any food for you,” he said. “People are flipping out. It’s panic mode. There’s still a line of a thousand or two thousand people with no food.”

Food pantry lines have already been getting longer over the past several months at the Salvation Army of Chelsea and East Boston, said Captain Isael Gonzalez, who oversees the emergency food program there. So, having to wait for the USDA program to restart with new vendors from out of state means he’s now struggling to serve the 700 families that seek out his services daily.

“Through the USDA program, we’ve been distributing over 2,100 boxes each week to families out of our office, and the good part is the boxes come prepacked, and there’s no labor on our end,” Gonzales said. “Not having those boxes is going to have a huge impact: It’s more trips to the Greater Boston Food Bank, more relying on local donations from different resources, and a lot of labor intensity on our part too.”

Ultimately, the USDA Food Box program provides just a small percentage of the overall food assistance currently in place in the region. But “we’ll take every food source we can and it’s definitely helpful,” Drennan, of the Greater Boston Food Bank, said. More importantly, she added, the program is set to expire by year’s end, and “unless another stimulus package comes out and they decide to renew, I don’t know what will happen.”

122,122,"May 21, 2018",,Summer hunger and how you can help - The Oxford Eagle,"Today, the EAGLE ran a story about food insecurity in Lafayette County, after a study released by Feeding America showed some surprising statistics.

The study named Mississippi the hungriest state, with 600,840 citizens – 176,580 of them children – struggling with food insecurity. In other words, a whopping one in five Mississippians don’t know where their next meal is coming from.

Lafayette County’s statistics aren’t much better, with 9,850 people considered food-insecure. 56 percent of the population lives below the SNAP threshold.

Food insecurity refers to USDA’s measure of lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods. Food-insecure households are not necessarily food insecure all the time.

Food insecurity may reflect a household’s need to make trade-offs between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bills, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods.

No parent should ever have to choose between providing a meal for their children or paying for basic needs. After reading all these statistics, I had to stop and ask myself, what have I done to help those people? What has the individual Oxonian done to help these people?

I say it often, and proudly, that the LOU community is one of the most generous I’ve ever seen. People here have a heart for philanthropy, and the money to support various causes.

Organizations like Interfaith Compassion Ministries, the Pantry, Lovepacks, Oxford Community Market, the Summer Meals program, various churches and on-campus groups work tirelessly to help those who may be in need. Others do so in secret, expecting no recognition, or simply volunteer their time.

When I spoke to Oxford School District’s director of child nutrition, Dan Westmoreland, I asked him, ‘What can the average person do to help the Summer Meal Program?’ His answer was simple: if you know a child in need, bring them. No strings attached, just give a child access to a healthy, balanced meal.

Food insecurity is its most prevalent during the summer months. With school out, children might only get one meal a day, not exactly enough to provide them with the energy they need to function.

Westmoreland’s suggestion led me to dig a little deeper and figure out warning signs for determining if a child is dealing with summer hunger. According to the YMCA’s national website, there are five telltale signs a child may be starving.

Some are more obvious, like if a child asks about food every day or if they’re not picky. Hoarding snacks or suddenly gaining or losing weight are also red flags. Others, however, require a little more perception. If a child’s teeth are decaying, it may be an indicator that the child has an inadequate diet. If they’re aggressive towards others or have a reputation as a bully, they may simply be “hangry” (hungry and angry). If they’re tired, or seem to have no energy, they could be going to bed with an empty stomach.

If you do know of a child or family who’s going hungry, there are ways to help directly. On a grand scale, you can organize a canned food drive or start a community garden. On a smaller, more personal scale, you can spread the word about programs available, or simply invite a friend over for dinner. Even clipping coupons for families in need can be the difference between going hungry and having a decent meal.

My hope is, in sharing these facts with readers, at least one child, one family, will receive the help they need. You might only be this child’s Sunday school teacher, their camp counselor, their neighbor, their babysitter. But you could also be the one person to take notice and do something to help.","Today, the EAGLE ran a story about food insecurity in Lafayette County, after a study released by Feeding America showed some surprising statistics.

123,123,"Jun 19, 2020",CBS News,Food scarcity is on the rise in America as the economy reels,"The number of American families struggling to put food on the table has seen a ""substantial"" increase since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve of St. Louis said in a new analysis of Census Bureau data.

Food insecurity — defined as the inability to afford healthy food for all family members — affected 37 million U.S. households even before the start of the disease outbreak. That's due in part to widening income inequality, which has undercut the economic gains during the weak recovery that followed the Great Recession. But food shortages are on the rise as unemployment has surged into double-digits and many workers are furloughed without pay.

More than 10% of households said they sometimes or often didn't have enough to eat in early June, the St. Louis Fed found. That compares with about 8% of households experiencing food scarcity before March 13, when states began shutting down businesses and layoffs spiked, according to Census data. With at least 21 million workers out of a job, 17 million additional Americans are at risk of becoming food insecure, Feeding America, a nonprofit coalition of food banks, said in a recent report.

""The lines for food at emergency feeding sites offer a picture of the human suffering that data can only begin to explain,"" according to a June 18 letter from Feeding America, along with more than 2,500 other advocacy organizations seeking increased funding for food stamps, that was sent to Senate leaders. ""This crisis demands a response that is commensurate with its scope and seriousness.""

According to Feeding America, nearly a quarter of Mississippi residents — more than 700,000 people — could struggle to get food this year, a sharp jump from previous years. Other states expected to see a spike in food insecurity are Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana.

And while food banks are stepping up, the need is overwhelming. In Houston last month, about 7,000 families showed up for distribution of food at a local food bank. The food bank's manager told ""CBS Evening News"" that demand had jumped 150% from prior to the pandemic.

Other parts of the country have seen similar incidents. In food handouts across the country, thousands of families have lined up in cars to pick up boxes of food, like one in Middlebury, Vermont, where some participants said they had never before experienced food insecurity, according to local newspaper Seven Days.

Trump administration pushes to cut food stamps

Because of increased hunger across the U.S., groups like Feeding America are advocating for a 15% increase in maximum benefits under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the official name for food stamps.

The groups also want an increase in the SNAP minimum monthly benefit from $16 to $30 and a suspension of time limits, as well as a pause in the Trump administration's rule changes that would cut SNAP eligibility and benefits for more than 5 million people.

""Sufficient and timely federal government action is needed to prevent even more human suffering and lost productivity in the short and longer terms,"" the groups said in their letter to Senate leaders this week.

Despite the surge in joblessness and food insecurity during the pandemic, the Trump administration has signaled it's moving forward with cuts to the food stamp program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month said it is appealing a court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from imposing additional work requirements for SNAP on poor adults without children, according to court documents.

The USDA said it was appealing the ruling because it believed it was the ""right approach"" and that it did not expect economic issues to continue indefinitely.","Food insecurity — defined as the inability to afford healthy food for all family members — affected 37 million U.S. households even before the start of the disease outbreak.

The last six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the deaths, layoffs, evictions and school closures, have brought immeasurable hardship and heartache, especially to Black and poor communities in Mississippi. The rippling effects seem to have altered most aspects of everyday life — except for a child’s nature.

“They’re still learning with virtual learning. They’re able to still play,” said Brooke Floyd, director of children’s services for Stewpot Community Services. “Like, I think that’s a beautiful thing, when you put kids out in the yard and they don’t have any toys or can’t use the equipment and they still have fun and you can hear the laughter.”

“To me, that’s letting us know that everything’s going to be okay.”

With more than four in ten already living in poverty, Jackson children have long felt the unmet needs — perhaps most visibly a historically underfunded and segregated school system — that the pandemic has illuminated in their communities.

Nearly every child in Jackson Public Schools is Black and lives in a low-income household, qualifying them for free or reduced lunch. School buildings never opened back up after March, spurring a frustrating fight to obtain enough E-learning technology for every student and sticking most families with tough decisions about where their kids will spend their days.

Unemployment benefits are dwindling and despite a federal moratorium, evictions have continued. And while efforts to get meals to children have been possibly the most valiant, food scarcity and affordability remains a persistent problem across the capital city.

This school year so far, the district has recorded 2,600 children — a tenth of their student body — as homeless, which usually means they are living unstably at other families’ homes. Still, about a third live in shelters or hotels. But this isn’t a COVID-19 problem: Last year, JPS had 3,100 enrollees in the federal McKinney-Vento grant to serve homeless students.

“A lot of our kids are so accustomed to going through a lot that it kind of rolls off them,” said Penney Ainsworth, CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Central Mississippi. “Kids will adapt to whatever the setting is and what’s going on. But it’s a scary time. So they’re nervous, but they’re resilient.”

“For people to expect the worst or think that the worst is going to happen, I’m not buying it. Even parents that are poor want their kids to succeed and they’re going to try their best to make it happen.” —Brooke Floyd, director of children services for Stewpot Community Services

Some parents have jobs working from home, a separate, difficult juggle, but many are relying on grandparents, aunts, cousins, friends and neighbors to fill in the child care gaps.

Other families are simply uncomfortable with the idea of placing their children in a center during a pandemic, Floyd said, especially knowing the virus has disproportionately taken the lives of Black people. So they’ve done whatever they must, even altering their work life, to keep their kids home.

Floyd and Ainsworth said they have contact with many of the families they’re not serving during this time. They know they can call if they’re in need, Floyd said, “and they do.”

But child services coordinators also recognize there are some children falling through the cracks. Floyd recalled meeting kids over the summer that she’d never seen before while delivering bags of food to apartment complexes where her students live.

“Kids ran to the van. They were like, ‘Can we have a bag?’ And I was like, ‘Where’s your mama?’ ‘I don’t know,'” Floyd said through tears. “I was like, ‘Oh my god. Who are you? What’s your name?’

“They’re lost,” she said. “We help the kids right in front of us, but if you work with children, you’re like, ‘What’s happening to the other kids? Who’s helping them? Who’s checking up on them?’”

Onlookers are quick to blame parents, she added, but a longstanding lack of access to affordable childcare and the drop in unemployment benefits in August have put some working parents, especially those without family support, in impossible situations.

“If I am doing everything I can for my children to survive, unfortunately sometimes I’m going to have to leave them,” she said.

When he first offered to facilitate, he thought he could use the time to complete his work, but a student in his class lacked a laptop and was conducting her lessons paper packets, so he’s letting her use his computer. He’ll work in the evenings to make up for it. “I think JPS kids are well-adapted … The ones that go here, I think they’re pretty much well-rounded, well-disciplined kids … Everyone’s respectful and that’s all I can really ask for,” Thomas said.

Jackson Public Schools is still offering breakfast and lunch to students during the closures, which has been a big help for the private centers. But the district isn’t otherwise subsidizing these programs, Ainsworth said, leaving most of the physical responsibilities that usually fall on public schools — staffing, sanitizing and keeping the lights on — to a patchwork of community partners.

“School is a safe place for many of our students and not being able to be in that safe place and be around friends and share experiences and that whole social aspect of schooling has all of our hearts heavy,” said Bobby Brown, principal at Jim Hill High School in west Jackson.

Even students who secured devices to use for distance learning have had trouble accessing their classes.

“We kinda have trouble getting into WiFi and stuff because it kinda shut down sometimes and we have to wait for a few minutes,” Keiyana, a fifth grader at Casey Elementary School, told Mississippi Today. “One time I missed class because of that.”

Khamiya, the 7-year-old, said doing all her schoolwork on the computer makes her tired and her hands ache.

“I don’t like online. I want to learn in the classroom. I like it (in-person) but I don’t want to get corona,” Khamiya said. “Whoever made it (the virus), I don’t know who made it, but they should have never made it.”

Kieyana, who attends the Boys and Girls Club Sykes unit in south Jackson, said virtual class is different in one way that adults might not expect: She said her teachers are less likely to yell at students over video calls “because they know that you’ll tell.” Keiyana is a good student; she said she’s getting all A’s and especially likes math and science. When she grows up, she wants to be a pediatrician, a perfect mix of her favorite school subjects and her love of helping care for babies. She said she wishes her school had a gym like the one she plays in at the Club and that her teachers “would stop yelling every now and then.”

Top childhood development experts aren’t as worried about what the impact of COVID-19 and distance learning will be on a child’s ability to keep up with school curriculum. Susan Buttross, a professor of child development at University of Mississippi Medical Center heading up the Mississippi Thrive! Child Health Development Project, said she’s more concerned with the loss of social connections and positive adult reinforcement.

“It’s not that we think kids can’t learn in distance learning,” Buttross said. “People are struggling with making enough money to survive. They’re struggling with so many other social determinants of health, being able to access the right kind of food, and jobs and housing and all of that. So many times, the primary caregiver at home is not equipped to then be the teacher too.”

Anxiety surrounding the virus and grief over a death in the family only compounds the chronic stress children living in poverty already endure. Fleeting stress is normal, Buttross explained, but toxic stress, when a child is constantly on high alert and their stress response system becomes overwhelmed, can hinder their brain development and wreak havoc on their health.

Research shows that the toxic stress of poverty — resulting from economic hardships, racial discrimination, deaths of loved ones or living in an area where violence is prevalent, for example — affects the part of the brain used for decision-making.

Khamiya said her family recently chose to move into a new apartment complex in west Jackson that they thought was in a safer neighborhood.

“We’ve been talking about community. It’s the area where people work and play,” Khamiya said, then she answered how she felt about her west Jackson community: “It’s good, but I don’t like how be people be shooting and killing people.”

The location of prominent community service agencies, west Jackson also has a higher concentration of homeless people than other parts of the city, and therefore higher visibility to someone like Khamiya.

“Do you ever feel bad for homeless people?” she asked this reporter. “I got feeling sad because they need money. They need a house. They need to feel safe.”

Not only are Black Mississippians disproportionately impacted by the nation’s wealth imbalance — three times more likely to live in poverty than whites — they’re also grieving at a higher rate due to converging national crises.

Almost one-third of Black Americans said in a Washington Post-Ipsos survey that they personally knew someone who had died from COVID-19 — compared to less than 10 percent of whites — which coupled with a national spotlight on policy brutality has spawned a bereavement crisis in Black America, Marissa Evans writes in a recent The Atlantic article.

A pair of siblings in Floyd’s program lost their mom in June. Floyd said she was in her thirties and died in her sleep. She didn’t think the mother had been sick.

Another former student, not even 20-years-old, took his own life this summer after becoming entangled in the criminal justice system.

Right as the pandemic began, Stewpot’s bus driver died from cancer. The kids were heartbroken. And they couldn’t have a memorial service due to social distancing.

“People can’t properly grieve right now,” Floyd said. “It’s almost like, you have to just keep moving the same way you were before because if you sit still and think about it, you’re going to lose it.”

But researchers working on toxic stress have also identified the ways to bolster resiliency for kids facing adversity.

“The one factor that keeps coming out is having one adult in their life who is positive, a ray of sunshine for them,” Buttross said. “One person who encourages them and helps them along … Somebody out there who says, ‘You’re good. You’re smart. You’re awesome. You can do something.’”

“It might not be a parent,” she added. “It might be a grandparent or a teacher.”

Or a volunteer at the after-school program.

Ainsworth, the local Boys and Girls Club CEO, said she herself grew up in government housing with a single mom and eight siblings in Norfolk, Virginia.

“My four blocks of the world did not define who I was and who I was going to be. That’s my desire for my Boys and Girls Club babies,” Ainsworth said. “I need them to know that this situation that you’re in right now, it may be bleak. But if we look to your future, we keep exposing you (to opportunity) … through workforce development, college tours, and those things, the sky is the limit for you too.”

Simultaneously, the pandemic has also produced a flood of resources and people called to help.

“Hopefully those people that are in need realize that there is almost an influx of support right now,” Floyd said.

This extends beyond the help that has come with federal pandemic relief packages, such as large investments in internet connectivity and devices for school children, increased food and unemployment benefits and extra money for housing assistance.

Jackson Public Schools received a nearly 70% increase in its annual McKinney-Vento grant to serve homeless students, some of whom also receive services at Stewpot. Faith Strong, the district’s coordinator for homeless services, said she hopes to hire more social workers who can work more directly to address individual students’ needs.

The Mississippi Food Network partnered with the district to distribute family food boxes with enough fresh and frozen foods to last a family several days. The Boys and Girls Club, the City of Jackson and Meals on Wheels partnered initially and delivered roughly 20,000 meals across the city.

“There were just churches with lines out in front of them handing out boxes to whoever showed up,” Floyd said. “I’ve been proud to watch as it’s happened.”

Even before the pandemic hit, Dole Packaged Foods, a subsidiary one of the world’s largest fruit and vegetable producers headquartered in California, chose Jackson as the first city it would bring its Sunshine for All program aimed at fighting food insecurity. The company called Mississippi’s capital city one of the largest food deserts in the nation. Dole partnered with the Boys and Girls Club and has been hosting a farmer’s market at the Capitol Street unit, where people can purchase fresh produce from local Footprint Farms.

“Me and my daughter have really benefitted from being able to come and give back on a Saturday, as well as the meals. It has been a big help to me, cause I’m a single parent,” said Ebony Yarn, a Club employee and volunteer. “I fall in the gap where I make too much to get assistance but then I don’t make enough, per se, to handle everything I need to do.”

Dole is also supporting local food hub Up in Farms’ Farm-to-Table Training Center and providing 1,000 meals to the needy; launching a virtual cooking camp that teaches kids about nutrition and cooking; and building community gardens at Boys and Girls Club locations.

“It’s truly unfair that the kids here in Jackson are limited in fresh fruits and vegetables or opportunities to go into a store and get it and it just came from the vine,” Ainsworth said, “but yet if they go down the street to Madison County, the food is being washed as it’s set down, you know? It’s fresh.”

The poverty rate in Jackson is about eight times higher than the 3.3% poverty rate in the city of Madison. For Ainsworth, these food programs are about more than nutrition.

“What I want to do is make sure that we are exposing our kids to knowing that you are worthy of any and everything that you desire,” she said.","The Jackson Public Schools students cannot attend their regular elementary schools, which closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

125,125,"Oct 2, 2020",Wiley,Food Insecurity during COVID‐19,"For a decade, Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG) has provided sub‐state‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children. Along with being extensively used by food banks, it is widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. In this paper, we describe the methods underpinning MMG, detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020, and how food insecurity rates may have changed due to COVID‐19 since 2018. We project an increase of 17 million Americans who are food insecure in 2020 but this aggregate increase masks substantial geographic variation found in MMG.

Introduction This year represents the tenth anniversary of Feeding America's Map the Meal Gap (MMG). On an annual basis, MMG provides county‐ and congressional district‐level estimates of food insecurity for both the full population and for children and, upon request, subcounty‐level results at, for example, the zip code level. Along with being extensively used by food banks to direct scarce resources to those most in need, it is now widely used by state and local governments to help plan responses to food insecurity in their communities. For MMG, food insecurity rates are calculated with an imputation method that uses information from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Since the Core Food Security Module (CSFM) is in the December CPS and the resulting data is not publicly released until September of the following year and the ACS is not released until December, this has meant that MMG, released in the spring, is based on data that is roughly eighteen months old. Given that post‐Great Recession, rates have remained relatively stable from year to year, as have geographical differences within and across states, this release schedule has not produced issues regarding timeliness. Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018. In this article, after describing the methods underpinning MMG, we detail the approach Feeding America has used to make projections about the geography of food insecurity in 2020 and how this may differ from 2018. Central to these projections is that the methods used in MMG allow for us to do this when information about predictions of the underlying variables are available. We then turn to a description of multiple aspects of this changed geography of food insecurity.

Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children). Examples of survey questions include: Did you or the other adults in your household ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?. Were you ever hungry but did not eat because you could not afford enough food? and Did a child in the household ever not eat for a full day because you could not afford enough food? (the most severe question). (For the complete set of questions, see Coleman‐Jensen et al. 2019.) The responses for some of these questions are yes or no. In other cases, respondents are asked if something happened never, sometimes, or often. A response of sometimes or often is counted as an affirmative response. Other questions ask respondents if something happened almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only one or two months. A response of almost every month or some months but not every month is counted as an affirmative response. Based on these responses, households are delineated into three categories: A household is said to be food secure if they respond affirmatively to two or fewer questions; low food secure if they respond affirmatively to three to seven questions (three to five questions for households without children); and very low food secure if they respond affirmatively to eight or more questions (six or more questions for households without children). Food insecure households are those without access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household. The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity. Methods We proceed in two steps to estimate the extent of food insecurity in each county (congressional district). Step 1 FI st = α + β UN UN st + β POV POV st + β MI MI st + β HISP HISP st + β BLACK BLACK st + β own OWN st + β DSBL DSBL st + μ t + υ s + ε st (1) where s is a state, t is year, UN is the unemployment rate, POV is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate, MI is median income, HISP is the percentage of Hispanics, BLACK is the percentage of African Americans, OWN is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners, DSBL is the percentage of individuals who report a disability, μ t is a year fixed effect, υ s is a state fixed effect, and ε st is an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Using state‐level data from 2009 to 2018, we estimate a model where the food insecurity rate for individuals at the state level is determined by the following equation:whereis a state,is year,is the unemployment rate,is the nonundergraduate student poverty rate,is median income,is the percentage of Hispanics,is the percentage of African Americans,is the percentage of individuals who are homeowners,is the percentage of individuals who report a disability,is a year fixed effect,is a state fixed effect, andis an error term. This model is estimated using weights defined as the state population. In previous iterations of MMG we used data back to 2001 but the disability variable is only available since 2009 and, hence, the model is estimated from 2009 to 2018. Our choice of variables was first guided by the literature on the determinants of food insecurity. We included variables that have been found in prior research to influence the probability of a household being food insecure. (For an overview of that literature in this context see Gundersen and Ziliak 2018.) While the food insecurity measure is defined at the household level, we assume all members of a food‐insecure household are food insecure, consistent with the approach found in, e.g., table 1 of Coleman‐Jensen et al. (2019). Next, we chose variables that are available both in the CPS and the ACS. Table 1.

The variables POV, MI, HISP, BLACK, OWN, and DISBL are based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures and UN is based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. We use the coefficient estimates from Step 1 plus information on the same variables defined at the county level to generate estimated food‐insecurity rates for individuals defined at the county level. This can be expressed in the following equation:wheredenotes a county. The variables, andare based on 2014–2018 ACS five‐year measures andis based on 2018 BLS one‐year measures. This year for MMG we made two primary changes. First, we added the percent of the population that has a disability to reflect the profound impact that disability status has on food insecurity. (See, e.g., Balistreri 2019; Brucker and Coleman‐Jensen 2017; Noonan, Corman, and Reichman 2016; Sonik et al. 2016.) Second, the poverty variable now only includes nonundergraduate students. This is because the true resources available to undergraduates are, on average, not reflected in the poverty rate. Consistent with this are the much lower food insecurity rates among college students in comparison to noncollege students of similar ages (Gundersen 2021). The above methods allow us to establish a base measure of food insecurity for all counties for the full population and for children. Using this base measure, we establish what we believe will happen to food insecurity in the US in 2020 because of the COVID‐19 pandemic. To do so, we consider what will occur if two of the variables in the model above, the unemployment rate and the poverty rate, increase along the lines predicted by expert opinions. (The other variables in our model are unlikely to change due to COVID‐19.) In our most recent estimates of the upper‐bound impact (as of July 13, 2020), we have assumed that the annual average unemployment rate will increase to 11.5% (up 7.6% compared to 2018) and the poverty rate will increase to 16.6% (up 4.8% compared to 2018). When we wrote the first version of this paper, there had not been expert projections of changes in poverty rates due to COVID‐19, so we assumed that the proportional change in the poverty rate viz. the unemployment rate would be roughly the same as during the Great Recession. To put this into terms of equation (2), we assume the value of UN C will increase (on average) by 0.076 and the value of POV c will increase by 0.048. This increase in the unemployment rate, though, is unlikely to be uniform across all counties in the US Instead, certain industries and occupations will be disproportionately affected by COVID‐19. So, we further adjust the county‐level and CD‐level unemployment projections for the proportion of the population that is likely to lose their jobs, combining data from the American Community Survey with estimates established in Hatzius et al. (2020).

Findings At the national level, we project 54 million food insecure Americans in 2020, approximately 17 million higher than in 2018. For children, the food insecurity rates are projected to increase to 18 million, up nearly 7 million from 2018. These national estimates, though, mask substantial heterogeneity across the country in terms of the projected impacts of COVID‐19. This is not unexpected, given the geographic diversity in the base models for both the full population (figure 1) and children (figure 2). Looking at states, the highest five states are the same whether or not COVID‐19 occurred—Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and New Mexico. However, there are some states that will see much higher food insecurity rates. Nevada stands out—pre‐COVID‐19 it would have been twentieth, but post‐COVID‐19 it is projected to be eighth. For children, Louisiana and New Mexico are first and second with or without COVID‐19, but Nevada is now third (ninth without COVID‐19). The substantially higher projected rates for Nevada are primarily due to their reliance on service sector jobs, which have been disproportionately affected by COVID‐19.

[Color figure can be viewed at [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com One of the key contributions from MMG is its portrayal of the substantial heterogeneity in local food insecurity that is seen in figures 1 and 2. The responses to COVID‐19 will also vary based on geography, although, consistent with the state results, there is likely to be some similarities in terms of county rankings. For the full population (table 1), we display, first, the fifteen counties with the highest rates of food insecurity in the base case and due to our projections. In the base case, the fifteen counties are all in the South or counties with Indian Reservations. The highest is Jefferson County, Mississippi (30.4%) and the fifteenth is Harlan County, Kentucky (24.8%). Without the adjustments for county‐level differences in unemployment rates described above, these would be the same orderings after COVID‐19 but, due to these adjustments, there are some differences. The five highest remain the same but, for example, Washington County, Mississippi and Wolfe County, Kentucky are now in the top fifteen. In the final two column of table 1 we display the projected percent increases in food insecurity for the highest fifteen counties. These are all counties with base rates that are relatively low, which is the reason for the substantial increases. The increases range from 157.3% in the highest (Burke County, North Dakota) to 109.5% in the fifteenth highest (Daggett County, Utah). These dramatic increases may be one reason for why some food banks reported being especially strained in response to COVID‐19. Table 2 has the same structure as table 1 but for children. As expected, there is overlap in counties between the two. For example, Kusilvak Census Area in Alaska is second highest for children and fourth highest for the full population for both the base case and the rankings after COVID‐19. There are some contrasts, though, insofar as Texas has no counties in the top fifteen for the full population but has four in the base case for children and four in the COVID‐19 projections. In terms of projected percent increases for children, there are some differences with the full population. While North Dakota has ten of the fifteen highest counties for the full population, they have two for children and, conversely, Virginia has one in the full population but six for children including the top three.

Conclusion The proceeding discussion—and the full set of results with updates as needed at http://map.feedingamerica.org/—provides an overview of the geographic diversity in food insecurity rates across the U.S. and what may happen due to COVID‐19. We conclude with three main points. First, while these projections of increased food insecurity rates are of great concern, they would have been for worse were it not for the resiliency of the agricultural supply chain in the face of COVID‐19. (For more on this, see the other articles in this Special Issue.) Given that food prices are a key determinant of food insecurity (e.g., Gregory and Coleman‐Jensen 2013; Courtemanche et al. 2019), if there had been price increases due to agricultural supply chain breakdowns, the food insecurity rates we have estimated would have been much higher. In other words, the projected increase in food insecurity is due to projected increases in unemployment and poverty and not problems within the agricultural sector. Future researchers may wish to consider why this success occurred and, in particular, the protections it afforded vulnerable persons. Second, our estimates are based on information from annual food insecurity measures for the full calendar year instead of food insecurity measures that are based on either shorter time frames (e.g., the previous thirty days) and or across years. In addition, these estimates are based on the full set of eighteen questions on the CFSM. Three other papers in this Special Issue employ other methods to ascertain the impact of COVID‐19 on food insecurity and, as such, our results are not directly comparable. (See Ahn and Norwood 2021; Restrepo, Rabbitt, and Gregory 2021: and Ziliak 2021.) Third, the accuracy of our projections will not become evident until September 2021 for the national results and March 2022 for the MMG estimates. We look forward to ascertaining the success (or lack of success) of our projections at that time.

Of course, COVID‐19 has changed all of this and, given the sharp projected increases in unemployment (and, hence, food insecurity) the levels of food insecurity across the United States are likely to be far higher in 2020 than in 2018.
Approach Food Insecurity The official measure of food insecurity in the US as established by the USDA uses responses to eighteen questions about food hardships due to financial constraints experienced by households (ten for households without children and eighteen for households with children).
The questions employed in MMG to define food insecurity are the same as those used by the USDA since 2001 to define food insecurity.
Second, our estimates are based on information from annual food insecurity measures for the full calendar year instead of food insecurity measures that are based on either shorter time frames (e.g., the previous thirty days) and or across years."

127,127,"Jan 31, 2019",Mississippi Today,"Clarksdale ‘brought home the bacon,’ and landed a new grocer seen as vital to the Delta town’s economy","CLARKSDALE – Like many rural Delta towns, this community of 16,000 battles with poverty related issues and limited access to fresh high quality foods is a top concern for many. Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

But, now city officials have announced a new grocer will come into the city, bringing healthy, fresh eats to the residents and neighboring counties.

“Last year, if you all remember, we were pulling out our handkerchiefs and saying goodbye to a grocery store player that had been here for decades, and many of us felt that loss,” said Jon Levingston, executive director of the Clarksdale/Coahoma County Chamber of Commerce.

“Today, we got the promise of a new wonderful grocery store, a new choice to buy quality food for our citizens here in Clarksdale. … Every community that is economically and financially sustainable has choices — choices in housing, choices in grocery stores, good jobs … and this is one more piece in an economic puzzle that allows us to create a sustainable, financial platform for Clarksdale.”

Over the past year, citizens feared the town would not secure another grocery store after the departure of Kroger, a primary option for residents. Many were in disbelief upon hearing news of its closing. Kroger officials cited that profits were declining at the Clarksdale store.

But the Kroger here was profitable, said Mayor Chuck Espy, adding that their year-end balance sheet indicated the store produced $17 million in revenue. Rather it was the corporation changing “their business model to depart from rural communities that look like Clarksdale or Third Street in Memphis,” that resulted in store shutting its doors, he said.

“(Places) where there were people who didn’t have a large discretionary dollar, where there was poverty or high minority population, they pulled out of those communities,” said Espy. “I understand from a corporate aspect, they’re looking for higher profit margin … but pulling out of areas that is designated as a food desert is devastating to a community.”

Clarksdale wasn’t the only town to lose its Kroger. Two other stores in Memphis closed. And a host of other Kroger locations have closed within the past year, several media outlets reported.

The closing here has had an economic impact on the city. Sales taxes have plummeted. In just the past four months, sales tax revenue was down $54,000, said Cathy Clark, Clarksdale city clerk. Online shopping and the loss of Kroger are the two primary factors, officials say.

Last year alone, sale tax revenue was down $125,000. But despite the decrease in revenue and declining population, Clarksdale leaders see new developments like Piggly Wiggly, as a way to grow the community, create more jobs, and bring in more revenue.

Dwan “Dee” Brown, economic developer of P3 Group, Inc., announced the building of the new Piggly Wiggly that will create about 75 jobs, at the mayor and board of commissioners January meeting.

Instead of moving into the old Kroger building, Brown, who’s spearheading the $39 million Corey L. Moore Sports and Recreational Complex in Clarksdale, said that Piggly Wiggly will be located at the complex site.

“As mayor, I’ve been in negotiations with three other entities to take over Kroger. Every entity thought the footprint was too large of a grocery chain,” said Espy in a phone call with Mississippi Today. “(Grocery chains are) moving away from big box stores and moving to smaller intimate stores.”

Brown echoed the mayor, adding that after conducting a market study, the results indicated that equipment, such as HVAC systems and coolers, in the former Kroger dated back to 1981 and the newest in 2001. It would be more costly to move out the old equipment, bring in new equipment, upgrade electrical work, among other things, he said.

The closest Piggly Wiggly to Clarksdale is about 38 miles north in Batesville. But unlike other Piggly Wiggly supermarkets, this one will be tailored specifically to Clarksdale’s culture: focusing on the blues.

“The new store will basically be a blues city Piggly Wiggly. It’ll be more than a shopping experience, it’ll be a cultural experience for those who come and visit,” said Brown. “It’ll be designed to capture the culture and heritage of Clarksdale.”

Blues music will not only reach customers ears when they walk in, but the interior design will reflect the blues culture, said Brown.

Aside from the grocery store, other amenities include a fuel center, a loyalty program to tie rewards from shopping to fuel purchases, curbside pickup for groceries, and delivery services to retirement homes and Coahoma Community College students. Brown noted that CCC students can apply for work study jobs at Piggly Wiggly that will be subsidized by the operations, which means revenue from the store will provide additional funds for students to have work study jobs.

Building the store will cost around $4 million and the fuel center will cost around $500,000, said Brown. They are looking to secure new market tax credits for the project. The sports complex along with the Piggly Wiggly will start the building phase in tandem.

If the process goes as planned, Brown said he hopes to break ground on the public infrastructure in May, construct buildings in August, and open around January or February in 2020.

“We have looked at this area for quite some time, and we know that there’s a need for a grocery store here in this area where you don’t have to go out of town and spend three hours round trip out of your day,” said Tim Chaffin, sales manager of Piggly Wiggly in Alabama at the meeting.

“Piggly Wiggly is not a cookie cutter concept. You can’t drop this store in Nashville, Tenn., or Atlanta, Ga., and it have the same feel. …This is an original.”

Chaffin said that a project of this magnitude is not as easy as putting something on a shelf. He said there is a preliminary site plan in place, but this is time consuming due to putting infrastructure in place and building the store.

Piggly Wiggly is a grocery wholesaler who partners with independent owners, operators, and economic developers. This particular store is a partnership between Brown, his partners CORE Construction and Chasm Architecture, and Piggly Wiggly representatives.

Like this rural town, there have been other communities seeking grocery store options. Another small town in Mississippi, Gloster, struggled with getting one for decades. Finally, they were able to bring a Piggly Wiggly to their town.

The issue of limited access to grocery stores is all too common in rural areas across the state. Mississippi has the fourth highest rate of food insecurity — the federal government’s measurement of hunger — in the country. Coahoma County, where Clarksdale is located, has one of the highest food insecurity rates in the state at 31 percent, eleven percent above the state average, according to data from Feeding America.

Though many citizens here were ecstatic about a new grocery store coming in, others questioned the location of the store via social media. A Mississippi Today reporter announcement of the store on Facebook, received 120 shares, 96 comments, and 176 reactions.

Residents argued it would be a hassle to get to the Piggly Wiggly location. Brown noted the distance of citizens driving to Piggly Wiggly versus citizens traveling to the former Kroger store is about a mile and a half for both.

Although the announcement came Monday, officials hope to have a ribbon cutting around this time next year.

“I have to say that I can’t pass this opportunity without saying, ‘Mr. mayor, board of commissioners, Tim, Dwan, y’all have really brought home the bacon, haven’t you?” said Levingston.

“They don’t call it Piggly Wiggly for nothing.”","Last year when one of the primary grocery stores, Kroger, closed for good, residents here were left with few local options.

129,129,"Aug 13, 2020",Northside Sun,A conversation with Martha Allen on works of Extra Table,"Extra Table is all about fighting food insecurity in Mississippi by stocking food pantries across the state with healthy foods. Martha Allen, whose career has primarily been in the non-profit realm, took over as executive director of Extra Table in March 2018. Allen recently spoke with Sun Staff Writer Nikki Rowell about the mission of Extra Table, and how the organization has been impacted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

What is the mission of Extra Table?

“Extra Table is the amazing partnership launched by well-known restaurateur Robert St. John, in 2009, making a difference in the lives of Mississippians by fundraising in order to stock food pantries and soup kitchens across the state with wholesome nutritious food.”

When did you become the executive director? What do you do in this role?

“March of 2018. I’ve been here a little over two and a half years, and on a daily basis I’m communicating with our food pantries and fundraising daily. We strictly fundraise in order to purchase new and healthy foods that we distribute monthly to our food pantries and soup kitchens throughout the state of Mississippi. Our goal is to fight hunger and obesity hand-in-hand, since Mississippi is at the top of both of those lists. We can make a difference when fighting those systematically and together.

Our food is always shelf stable, so low sodium soups, low sodium vegetables, fruit in 100 percent juice, lots of lean protein like tuna, beans, peanut butter and great whole grains, like oatmeal, granola bars, grits, pasta and rice.”

Since Mississippi has a problem with food insecurity and, in turn, obesity, can you talk a bit about the importance of not only getting food to the hungry in Mississippi, but how Extra Table goes a step further to ensure that the food is healthy?

“When Robert St. John formed Extra Table in 2009, he founded it on two principles, that when we fundraise for food, all the money goes to food. Our administrative costs are raised separately. The second principle is that 100 percent of our food is always going to be healthy. So, we ship food that is not processed.

We know that there are so many people in Mississippi with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease. When they don’t have a choice of where to go for food, we want our food to offer hope and be respectful and to support whatever health concern they’re dealing with. So, when a lady enters the pantry with high blood pressure or diabetes, we want our food to help her condition, not harm her condition or add to it.

We know that in a rural state like Mississippi, access to grocery stores is tough with the average distance to a grocery store being 30 miles in many places. So, food accessibility and affordability is critical. It’s definitely easier to run through a drive-through versus having food at home to prepare.”

Can you walk me through how the process works as far as how Extra Table facilitates getting the food and getting it to these facilities?

“Yes, it’s four easy steps. Step one, we fundraise. Step two, we purchase. Step three, we distribute to food pantries and soup kitchens. And step four, people are fed. It seems like a difficult concept, but it’s based on a really simple idea that is extremely efficient and effective, allowing us to get the best quality foods to the most people. We don’t participate in canned food drives. We strictly fundraise in order to buy food.

We’re really excited that throughout COVID our support has gone up and our reach has broadened. We are now able to say that $1 feeds 5.9 healthy meals.”

What are some of the organizations Extra Table works with in the Jackson metro?

“Working Together Jackson, Good Samaritan, MadCAAP, StewPot, Midtown Partners, Central United Methodist Church, Operation Upward, the Boys and Girls Club, Spring Forth Opportunity, Grace House and Galloway Mission are just to name a few.”

How many people benefit from this each year?

“Over 500,000 meals are provided annually.”

How badly is Mississippi affected by food insecurity?

“There are 680,000 Mississippians that struggle with hunger, so one in five Mississippians. Those numbers are prior to COVID-19.”

Has COVID-19 had an impact on Extra Table, as far as leading to more people needing its services?

“We are seeing a 30 to 50 percent increase in requests for food at our food pantries and soup kitchens. Immediately when COVID hit and grocery store shelves became scarce and food became a little more expensive, we realized that we had to evaluate our process in order to ensure that food would be coming in the future months. We kind of went back to the drawing board and had a whole new way of purchasing and shipping our food. We’re saving an additional 30 percent. In the face of a global pandemic, we’ve learned lessons and improved our system that was already efficient and effective.

We are excited about that. We have partnered with Good Sam in Jackson and got the hub for the hungry, where we have been rescuing food and putting it on refrigerated and freezer trucks there so that we can distribute it to our partners as the need arises or as they’re able to come get it so that food doesn’t go to waste. Our goal is to have zero food go to waste on our watch. We’ve partnered with farmers like Two Brooks Rice, so we have Mississippi-grown rice that we are distributing to our food pantries and soup kitchens.

We have an apartment complex, Heritage Properties in Hattiesburg, that is renovating and donating their freezers and refrigerators to us to distribute to our food pantries and soup kitchens. We’re working with a group of fishermen on the Mississippi Gulf Coast to get another source of great protein out to our pantries and soup kitchens. We’ve been working with the Community Foundation for Mississippi and the Community Foundation for Washington County, both through grants and food box programs, in order to provide more food for Mississippians.

And we were so grateful for the businesses in the Jackson metro and the Junior League ladies for their support in our COVID efforts and fighting hunger.”

What about on the fundraising side? Have you guys had to cancel fundraising events? If so, how have you been able to bridge the gap in donations?

“Yes. Within the first month, we lost anywhere from $75,000 to $100,000 in events. The spring is a busy time for all nonprofits. As the fall ramps back up, we have had to cancel many things and transfer them and learn how they translate into virtual events or drive through, contactless events. It is a daily learning curve. We’re working really hard, and we are so grateful that our donors believe in the work we do and believe in telling the Extra Table story. We’re blessed and know we are going to be able to continue feeding people during this pandemic.

In the face of a global pandemic, not only have we been able to provide better food, but more food to each of our food pantries. In the height of the pandemic, we were providing food weekly, and we have gone back to monthly now. But it is a much, much larger load. We are thrilled.”

Does Extra Table rely more on individual donations or businesses?

“It is a 50/50 mix. It is a beautiful mix of businesses and individuals that are passionate and know that nutrition is so valuable at all stages of our lives, that if children don’t have good nutrition in early childhood development we know their brain doesn’t fully develop and that is not something that they can catch back up on. We know for students in the classroom that if they’re hungry they’re not paying attention and they’re not listening. Further up, we know hunger is a huge problem on college campuses. Then, for adults, it is difficult for adults to maintain a job and maintain safety and continue to report to work day after day if they are extremely food insecure or struggling with hunger.

Extra Table is proud to be a partner that helps put food on the table in homes throughout Mississippi. It’s healthy food. It’s the same stuff our donors would want to go home at night and eat. We provide new, shelf-stable food all over the state of Mississippi.”

130,130,"Jun 9, 2020",CNN,Groceries were hard to find for millions. Now it's getting even worse,"New York (CNN Business) The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and limited delivery slots for online groceries.

But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

In 2015, an estimated 39 million people, or 12.8% of the US population, lived in ""low income and low access areas,"" according to the USDA's most recent data

The areas are defined as those where a ""significant"" portion of the population lives more than a mile from the nearest supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or 10 miles away in rural areas. The poverty rate is either 20% or greater, or the median-family income is below or equal to 80% of the statewide median family income.

Such areas are commonly known as food deserts, even though the term has no official meaning. it's increasingly difficult for the people who live in them to buy food.

During the pandemic, grocers have cut back their operating hours. Public transportation has been reduced, and riders who once traveled to stores in other neighborhoods or cities can no longer do so. Some older or higher-risk populations are fearful of traveling during the pandemic.

There's also evidence that food accessibility challenges are growing. In Georgia, the number of residents now living in ""food insecure"" areas has jumped 69% since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data firm Urban Footprint. The firm uses an index, including jobless claims, pre-existing health conditions, and access to grocery stores and healthy food, to measure food security — or ""reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritionally adequate food.""

In Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky the number of residents living in food insecure areas has spiked 43%, 36% and 118% respectively, driven by the rise in unemployment, according to the analysis

The pandemic has made it ""very cumbersome"" to buy groceries, said Yolanda Jackson, who lives 1.6 miles from her nearest grocery store in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2018, 23.5% of Baltimore residents lived in an area where access to healthy food is limited.

Jackson usually takes the bus to Shoppers grocery store, but stopped during the pandemic in part because of the long waits. She has been going to corner stores and bodegas ""where the selections are low and the prices are high,"" she said.

Online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who rely on food stamps.

s minorities. The problem of food access disproportionately affectminorities. Research from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that lower-income minority neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores compared with similar white neighborhoods.

""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data.

'Online grocery shopping is not equal'

Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce, public health experts say.

Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.

""With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than processed items,"" said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes.

During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online.

Amazon AMZN Walmart WMT In states that do allow recipients to use their benefits online, their options are usually onlyor, which have gaps in where they deliver groceries to customers' home. And some deliveries have minimum purchase requirements or added shipping fees, which can be a barrier for low-income customers.

""Access to online grocery shopping is not equal,"" said Caitlin Caspi, assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

Rep. Sanford Bishop, chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Subcommittee, wrote to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue last week urging the department to expand the number of grocers eligible to participate in the online program. ""Of the approved retailers, only two are national chains and only one of the national retailers can reach our most rural communities,"" Bishop said.

As food access challenges swell during the pandemic, cities, food banks, schools and community organizations are trying to find creative solutions.

""The public school system and many charter and private schools are continuing to offer meals to children and some of our urban farmers and chefs are teaming up to make meals for people in their neighborhoods who are in need of food,"" said Winona Bynum from the Detroit Food Policy Council.

In Baltimore, the city has developed an emergency response strategy. It's working to expand residents' participation in the food stamp program, which allows for online purchasing in the state of Maryland. The city has also ramped up delivering boxes of shelf-stable groceries and produce to residents' homes.","But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them.

Nine years into the economic recovery, roughly one in eight U.S. households still struggle to get enough food to eat, at least occasionally, but the longer-term trend has been marked by gradual improvement.

Some 11.8 percent of American households — and slightly more in Arizona — were deemed ""food insecure,"" according to a report released Sept. 5 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

That definition means one or more members of these households faced some period during 2017 when their food intake was reduced and eating patterns disrupted, usually because of a lack of money.

Slightly more Arizonan households, 13.1 percent, were food insecure, placing the state in 18th place in this dubious measure. States were evaluated over a different three-year span, covering 2015 to 2017.

Neighboring New Mexico had the nation's highest rate of household food insecurity at 17.9 percent, followed by four Southern states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Hawaii had the lowest rate, 7.4 percent of households, slightly better than New Jersey and North Dakota.

Arizona improved from 12th place, and a 14.9 percent rate of food insecurity, in an earlier study covering 2013-15.

Occasional struggles

Authors of the report noted that most Americans don't face hunger throughout the year.

""When households experience very low food security in the United States, the resulting instances of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns are usually occasional or episodic, but not usually chronic,"" they said.

Nevertheless, Melissa Boteach, a senior vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, cited the report as evidence that ""far too many Americans, especially households with children, are struggling to put food on the table.""

In a statement, she attacked President Donald Trump for downplaying poverty and urged the White House to adopt policies such as a higher national minimum wage.

The latest 11.8 percent food-insecurity level marked an improvement from 12.3 percent in 2016. After peaking at 14.9 percent in 2011, in the wake of the recession, the rate has declined for six straight years. It hasn't dropped below 10 percent for the past two decades. It stood at 11.1 percent at the outset of the recession in 2007.

Jerry Brown, a spokesman for St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix, agreed that food insecurity has alleviated somewhat in Arizona recently, allowing his group to serve high-risk groups that the organization wasn't able to connect with earlier.

""We have been able to expand because we haven't been in an all-hands-on-deck situation, manning the lines to get food to people in need,"" he said.

Examples of St. Mary's expanded outreach include sending mobile-pantry trucks into high-need neighborhoods in the town of Guadalupe and the Maryvale community in west Phoenix and delivering food to public school systems on tribal reservations in northern Arizona.

High-risk groups

The latest study incorporated survey responses from more than 37,000 households, with help from the Census Bureau.

Nationally, 30.8 percent of people living below the poverty level dealt with food insecurity last year. Other groups with high rates included African-Americans (21.8 percent), Hispanics (18 percent) and households with children (15.7 percent), including those headed by a single woman (30.3 percent) or single man (19.7 percent).

Arizona has an above-average rate of food insecurity involving children, Brown said, citing information from another study. ""We still have about 400,000 kids facing food insecurity (in Arizona), but we're getting better,"" he said.

About three in five food-insecure households took advantage of one or more of the three main federal food assistance programs — SNAP or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps), the National School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Arizona has an above-average rate of food insecurity involving children, Brown said, citing information from another study.
""We still have about 400,000 kids facing food insecurity (in Arizona), but we're getting better,"" he said."
132,132,"Sep 15, 2020",The Counter,Study: 29 million American adults don’t have enough to eat—a threefold increase since 2018,"Months into the pandemic, an American hunger crisis has exploded, with tens of millions of people suddenly wondering if they will be able to put food on the table.

According to a new report commissioned by the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), as of July, the number of people who said they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat has skyrocketed to 29 million, or 11 percent of adults in the United States. (By comparison, 8 million adults, or around 4 percent, did not have enough to eat in 2018.) In 38 states and Washington, D.C., more than one in ten adults with children had inadequate amounts of food, with the highest rates of hunger in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.

As expected, people of color and those without a college education were more likely to go hungry. The pandemic has exacerbated their vulnerabilities: More than 20 percent of Black and Latinx families reported they did not have enough to eat, which is double the rate of whites. Women, who were more likely to have lost their jobs, also reported higher rates of hunger.

Now, new data from the Census Bureau, referenced in the report, shows that even America’s middle class is now reckoning with hunger. Two years ago, only 3 percent of adults earning between $50,000 and $75,000 a year said they did not have enough to eat; during the pandemic, that rose to 8 percent. Similarly, 5 percent of adults earning between $35,000 and $50,000 reported that hunger in 2018; now, it is 12 percent.","Months into the pandemic, an American hunger crisis has exploded, with tens of millions of people suddenly wondering if they will be able to put food on the table.
